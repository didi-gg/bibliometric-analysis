Abstract = {The paper highlights the importance of using data -driven
   decision-making tools in Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) to improve
   academic performance and support sustainable development. HEIs must
   utilize data analytics tools, including educational data mining,
   learning analytics, and business intelligence, to extract insights and
   knowledge from educational data. These tools can help HEIs' leadership
   monitor and improve student enrolment campaigns, track student
   performance, evaluate academic staff, and make data-driven decisions.
   Although decision support systems have many advantages, they are still
   underutilized in HEIs, leaving field for further research and
   implementation. To address this, the authors summarize the benefits of
   applying data-driven decision approaches in HEIs and review various
   frameworks and methodologies, such as a course recommendation system and
   an academic prediction model, to aid educational decision-making. These
   tools articulate pedagogical theories, frameworks, and educational
   phenomena to establish mainstay significant components of learning to
   enable the scheming of superior learning systems. The tools can be
   utilized by the placement agencies or companies to find out their
   probable trainees/ recruitees. They can help students in course
   selection, and educational management in being more efficient and
   effective.},

Abstract = {Purpose In this paper, the challenging and thorny issue of assessing
   graduate attributes (GAs) is addressed. An interdisciplinary team at The
   University of Alberta ----developed a formative model of assessment
   centered on students and instructor interaction with course content.
   Design/methodology/approach The paper starts by laying the theoretical
   groundwork on which this novel GA assessment tool is based, that is,
   competency-based education, assessment theory and GA assessment. It
   follows with a description of the online assessment tool for GAs that
   was developed in the course of this project. Findings The online
   assessment tool for GAs targets three types of stakeholders: (1)
   students, who self-assess in terms of GAs, (2) instructors, who use the
   tool to define the extent to which each GA should be inculcated in their
   course and (3) administrators, who receive aggregate reports based on
   the data gathered by the system for high-level analysis and
   decision-making. Collected data by students and professors advance
   formative assessment of these transversal skills and assist
   administration in ensuring the GAs are addressed in academic programs.
   Graduate attributes assessment program (GAAP) is also a space for
   students to build a personal portfolio that would be beneficial to
   highlight their skills for potential employers. Research
   limitations/implications This research has strong implications for the
   universities, since it can help institutions, academics and students
   achieve better results in their practices. This is done by demonstrating
   strong links between theory and practice. Although this tool has only
   been used within the university setting by students, instructors and
   administrators (for self-, course and teaching and program improvement),
   it could increase its social and practical impact by involving potential
   employers and increase our understanding of student employability.
   Moreover, because the tool collects data on a continuous basis, it lends
   itself to many possible applications in educational data mining,
   Practical implications The GAAP can be used and adapted to various
   educational contexts. The plugin can be added to any Learning Management
   System (LMS), and students can have access to their data and results
   throughout their education. Social implications The GAAP allows
   institutions to provide a longitudinal formative assessment of students'
   graduate attributes acquisition. It provides solid and valid evidence of
   students' progress in a way that would advance society and citizenship.
   Originality/value To date, the GAAP is the first online interactive
   platform that has been developed to longitudinally assess the
   acquisition of GAs during a complete academic cycle/cohort. It provides
   a unique space where students and instructors interact with assessment
   scales and with concrete data for a complete university experience
   profile.},

Abstract = {Currently, universities are being forced to change the paradigms of
   education, where knowledge is mainly based on the experience of the
   teacher. This change includes the development of quality education
   focused on students' learning. These factors have forced universities to
   look for a solution that allows them to extract data from different
   information systems and convert them into the knowledge necessary to
   make decisions that improve learning outcomes. The information systems
   administered by the universities store a large volume of data on the
   socioeconomic and academic variables of the students. In the university
   field, these data are generally not used to generate knowledge about
   their students, unlike in the business field, where the data are
   intensively analyzed in business intelligence to gain a competitive
   advantage. These success stories in the business field can be replicated
   by universities through an analysis of educational data. This document
   presents a method that combines models and techniques of data mining
   within an architecture of business intelligence to make decisions about
   variables that can influence the development of learning. In order to
   test the proposed method, a case study is presented, in which students
   are identified and classified according to the data they generate in the
   different information systems of a university.},

Title = {A decision support framework to incorporate textual data for early
   student dropout prediction in higher education},
Journal = {DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEMS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {168},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Managing student dropout in higher education is critical, considering
   its substantial impacts on students' lives, academic institutions, and
   society as a whole. Using predictive modeling can be instrumental for
   this task, as a means to identify dropouts proactively on the basis of
   student characteristics and their academic performance. To enhance these
   predictions, textual student feedback also might be relevant; this
   article proposes a hybrid decision support framework that combines
   predictive modeling with student segmentation efforts. A real-life data
   set from a French higher education institution, containing information
   of 14,391 students and 62,545 feedback documents, confirms the superior
   performance of the proposed framework, in terms of the area under the
   curve and top decile lift, compared with various benchmarks. In
   contributing to decision support system research, this study (1)
   proposes a new framework for automatic, data-driven segmentation of
   students based on textual data; (2) compares multiple text
   representation methods and confirms that incorporating student textual
   feedback data improves the predictive performance of student dropout
   models; and (3) establishes useful insights to help decision-makers
   anticipate and manage student dropout behaviors.},
