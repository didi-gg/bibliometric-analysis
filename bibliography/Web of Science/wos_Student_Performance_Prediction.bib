Title = {Explaining Individual and Collective Programming Students' Behavior by
   Interpreting a Black-Box Predictive Model},

Abstract = {Predicting student performance as early as possible and analysing to
   which extent initial student behaviour could lead to failure or success
   is critical in introductory programming (CS1) courses, for allowing
   prompt intervention in a move towards alleviating their high failure
   rate. However, in CS1 performance prediction, there is a serious lack of
   studies that interpret the predictive model's decisions. In this sense,
   we designed a long-term study using very fine-grained log-data of 2056
   students, collected from the first two weeks of CS1 courses. We extract
   features that measure how students deal with deadlines, how they fix
   errors, how much time they spend programming, and so forth.
   Subsequently, we construct a predictive model that achieved cutting-edge
   results with area under the curve (AUC) of.89, and an average accuracy
   of 81.3\%. To allow an effective intervention and to facilitate human-AI
   collaboration towards prescriptive analytics, we, for the first time, to
   the best of our knowledge, go a step further than the prediction itself
   and leverage this field by proposing an approach to explaining our
   predictive model decisions individually and collectively using a
   game-theory based framework (SHAP), (Lundberg et al., 2020) that allows
   interpreting our black-box non-linear model linearly. In other words, we
   explain the feature effects, clearly by visualising and analysing
   individual predictions, the overall importance of features, and
   identification of typical prediction paths. This method can be further
   applied to other emerging competitive models, as the CS1 prediction
   field progresses, ensuring transparency of the process for key
   stakeholders: administrators, teachers, and students.},

Title = {Evaluating the student performance prediction and action framework
   through a learning analytics intervention study},
Journal = {EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 AUG 6},
Abstract = {Learning analytics intervention (LAI) studies aim to identify at-risk
   students early during an academic term using predictive models and
   facilitate educators to provide effective interventions to improve
   educational outcomes. A major impediment to the uptake of LAI is the
   lack of access to LAI infrastructure by educators to pilot LAI, which
   typically requires substantial institution-wide efforts and investment
   to collect related data sets and develop accurate predictive models that
   identify at-risk students and also provide tools to facilitate
   interventions. This paper presents a novel LAI framework, termed Student
   Performance Prediction and Action (SPPA), that facilitates educators to
   seamlessly provide LAIs in their courses avoiding the need for
   large-scale institution-wide efforts and investments. Educators develop
   course-specific predictive models using historical course assessment
   data. In learning analytics, providing effective interventions is a
   challenge. SPPA utilises pedagogy principles in course design and
   interventions to facilitate effective interventions by providing
   insights into students' risk levels, gaps in students' knowledge, and
   personalised study/revision plans addressing knowledge gaps. SPPA was
   evaluated in a large undergraduate course on its ability to predict
   at-risk students and facilitate effective interventions as well as its
   ease of use by academics. The results are encouraging with high
   performance of predictive models, facilitating effective interventions
   leading to significant improved educational outcomes with positive
   feedback and uptake by academics. With its advantages, SPPA has the
   potential to catalyse and influence wide-scale adoption in LAIs.},

   Students in Computer Science},
Journal = {TECHNOLOGY KNOWLEDGE AND LEARNING},

Abstract = {Predicting academic performance for students majoring in computer
   science has long been a significant field of research in computing
   education. Previous studies described that accurate prediction of
   students' early-stage performance could identify low-performing students
   and take corrective action to improve performance. Besides, adopting
   machine learning algorithms with predictive analytics has proven
   possible and meaningful. The traditional approach of looking after
   students without uncovering the root causes of poor performance has
   shifted dramatically into improving the quality of the educational
   processes of students, teachers, and stakeholders. Thus, this study
   employed predictive analytics to develop an early warning prediction
   model using computing science degree performance data at a public
   institution. Predictive models based on our data analysis revealed that
   low, medium, and high-performing students could be predicted with an
   accuracy of 88\% using only the grades of the courses they took in the
   second year. Moreover, 96\% accuracy was achieved when all course grades
   were used in predictive models. The courses that are important in
   determining the overall performance of the students were also analyzed.
   By employing a multi-method approach, utilizing a large dataset spanning
   four academic years, and including a diverse sample of 430 students, our
   study offers a robust foundation to researchers, designers, and computer
   science educators for understanding and predicting student performance.
   The enhanced generalizability and implications for educational practice
   position our study as a valuable contribution to the field, paving the
   way for further advancements in predictive analytics.},

Abstract = {Improving student learning performance requires proper preparation and
   strategy so that it has an impact on improving the quality of education.
   One of the preparatory steps is to make a prediction modeling of student
   performance. Accurate student performance prediction models are needed
   to help teachers develop the potential of diverse students. This
   research aims to create a predictive model of student performance with
   hyperparameter optimization in the Support Vector Regression Algorithm.
   The hyperparameter optimization method used is the Metaheuristic
   Algorithm. The Metaheuristic Algorithms used in this study are Particle
   Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Genetic Algorithm (GA). After obtaining the
   best SVR hyperparameter, the next step is to model student performance
   predictions, which in this study produced two models, namely PSVR
   Modeling and GSVR Modeling. The resulting predictive modeling will also
   be compared with previous researchers' prediction modeling of student
   performance using five models: Support Vector Regression, Naive Bayes,
   Neural Network, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. The regression
   performance metric parameter, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), evaluates
   modeling results. The test results show that predictive student
   performance using PSVR Modeling produces the smallest RMSE value of
   1.608 compared to predictions of student performance by previous
   researchers so that the proposed prediction model can be used to predict
   student performance in the future.},

Title = {Modeling Learners to Early Predict Their Performance in Educational
   Computer Games},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Pages = {20399-20417},
Abstract = {Data mining approaches have proven to be successful in improving
   learners' interaction with educational computer games. Despite the
   potential of predictive modelling in providing timely adaptive learning
   and gameplay experience, there is a lack of research on the early
   prediction of learners' performance in educational games. In this
   research, we propose an early predictive modelling approach, called
   GameEPM, to estimate learners' final scores in an educational game for
   promoting computational thinking. Specifically, the GameEPM approach
   models the sequence of learners' actions and then uses a limited
   sequence of the actions to predict the final score of the game for each
   learner. The findings from our initial trials show that our approach can
   accurately and robustly estimate the learners' performance at the early
   stages of the game. Using less than 50\% of learners' action sequences,
   the cross-validated deep learning model achieves a squared correlation
   higher than 0.8 with a relative error of less than 8\%, outperforming a
   range of regression models like linear regression, random forest, neural
   networks, and support vector machines. An additional experiment showed
   that the validated deep learning model can also achieve high performance
   while tested on an independent game dataset, showing its applicability
   and robustness in real-world cases. Comparing the results with
   traditional machine learning methods revealed that, in the validation
   and application phases, up to 0.30 and 0.35 R-2 gain is achieved in
   favor of the deep learning model, respectively. Finally, we found that
   while the lengths of action sequences influence the predictive power of
   the traditional machine learning methods, this effect is not substantial
   in the deep learning model.},

Abstract = {Virtual Learning Environments (VLE), such as Moodie and Blackboard,
   store vast data to help identify students' performance and engagement.
   As a result, researchers have been focusing their efforts on assisting
   educational institutions in providing machine learning models to predict
   at-risk students and to improve their performance. However, it requires
   an efficient approach to construct a model that can ultimately provide
   accurate predictions. Consequently, this study proposed a hybrid machine
   learning framework to predict students' performance using eight
   classification algorithms and three ensemble methods (Bagging, Boosting,
   Voting) to determine the best-performing predictive model. In addition,
   this study used filter-based and wrapper-based feature selection
   techniques to select the best features of the dataset related to
   students' performance. The obtained results reveal that the ensemble
   methods recorded higher predictive accuracy when compared to single
   classifiers. Furthermore, the accuracy of the models improved due to the
   feature selection techniques utilized in this study.},

Abstract = {While the recent technological advancements have enabled instructors to
   deliver mathematical concepts and theories beyond the physical
   boundaries innovatively and interactively, poor performance and low
   success rate in mathematic courses have always been a major concern of
   educators. More specifically, in an online learning environment, where
   students are not physically present in the classroom and access course
   materials over the network, it is toilsome for course coordinators to
   track and monitor every student's academic learning and experiences.
   Thus, automated student performance monitoring is indispensable since it
   is easy for online students, especially those underperforming, to be
   ``out of sight,{''} hence getting derailed and off-track. Since student
   learning and performance are evolving over time, it is reasonable to
   consider student performance monitoring as a time-series problem and
   implement a time-series predictive model to forecast students'
   educational progress and achievement. This research paper presents a
   case study from a higher education institute where interaction data and
   course achievement of a previously offered online course are used to
   develop a time-series predictive model using a Long Short-Term Memory
   network, a special kind of Recurrent Neural Network architecture. The
   proposed model makes predictions of student status at any given time of
   the semester by examining the trend or pattern learned in the previous
   events. The model reported an average classification accuracy of 86 and
   84\% with the training dataset and testing dataset, respectively. The
   proposed model is trialed on selected online math courses with exciting
   yet dissimilar trends recorded.},

Title = {USING CURVE ESTIMATION MODELS TO PREDICT STUDENTS ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE
   BASED ON AVERAGE UNIVERSITY ADMISSION STANDARDS: A COMPARATIVE CASE
   STUDY OF PRINCE SATTAM BIN ABDULAZIZ UNIVERSITY AND SANA'A UNIVERSITY},
Journal = {ADVANCES AND APPLICATIONS IN STATISTICS},

Abstract = {There is an increasing demand for predicting the students' performance
   in undergraduate level to help the decision makers to plan the admission
   of students to the various specializations. Whereas Prince Sattam
   University (PSU) and Sana'a University (SU) have large databases of
   students' information, such databases are not used effectively for
   decision-making. One of such difficulties stems from the weakness of
   some statistical methods in analyzing large volumes of data, resulting
   in unreliable outputs and results. In order to overcome these
   difficulties, alternative methods are constantly developed by
   researchers. As data mining simulates the role of a data analyst in
   exploring the relationships between data as authenticated in the actual
   data records, one of the most popular data mining techniques is the
   predictive model. Curve estimation model (CEM) stands by far as the most
   important predictive modeling technique. The CEM is used to build a
   highly efficient regression model to boost the accuracy of the results
   which can then be generalized. This paper mainly aims to build an
   accurate regression model to predict the extent to which the mean of
   admission criteria (MAC) contributes to the academic achievement for the
   two universities' students. The proposed model will be of help to
   university decision-makers in predicting students with more likelihood
   of poor academic attainment and helping such students improve the level
   of their educational attainment or to redirect them to specializations
   suiting their abilities. In terms of methodology, the investigation
   started by collecting the datasets, followed by data preprocessing
   stage, model establishment stage, and pattern evaluation stage. The
   results confirmed that the cubic model was the best model for both the
   universities. Further, the decision-makers at both universities are
   advised to use the cubic model when forecasting the students' academic
   achievement based on the mean of admission criteria. Also, results
   showed that it could identify at-risk students in a timely manner and
   improve the overall efficiency and effectiveness of education
   management. Further, the decision-makers in all the universities are
   recommended to utilize the data mining techniques based on the CEM,
   being the potential mean to analyze very large size records in quite
   short time.},

Abstract = {Educational Data Science has meant an important advancement in the
   understanding and improvemen of learning models in recent years. One of
   the most relevant research topics is student performance prediction
   through click-stream activity in virtual learning environments, which
   provide abundant information about their behaviour during the course.
   This work explores the potential of Deep Learning and Meta-Learning in
   this field, which has thus far been explored very little, so that it can
   serve as a basis for future studies. We implemented a predictive model
   which is able to automatically optimise the architecture and
   hyperparameters of a deep neural network, taking as a use case an
   educational dataset that contains information from more than 500
   students from an online university master's degree. The results show
   that the performance of the autonomous model was similar to the
   traditionally designed one, which offers significant benefits in terms
   of efficiency and scalability. This also opens up interesting areas of
   research related to Meta-Learning applied to educational Big Data.},

Abstract = {The prediction of final semester grades is a crucial undertaking in
   education, offering insights into student performance and enabling
   timely interventions to support their academic journey. This paper
   employs a deep learning approach, specifically gated recurrent unit
   (GRU), in conjunction with feature optimization using analysis of
   variance (ANOVA), to forecast final semester grades. The predictive
   model is trained and evaluated on a handcrafted grade prediction
   dataset, which contains the academic performance of the students during
   Plus 2 and from Semester 1 to Semester 4 of a group of Computer science
   and Engineering majors in Kerala. By processing historical academic
   records and contextual information, the GRU model learns to predict
   future performance accurately. To enhance the model's efficacy and
   interpretability, ANOVA is applied to optimize the feature selection
   process. This statistical technique identifies the most influential
   factors contributing to final grades, refining the model's predictive
   power while reducing dimensionality. The experimental results showcase
   the model's effectiveness in predicting final semester grades,
   demonstrating superior accuracy and performance compared to grade
   prediction using CNN with Bayesian optimization and LSTM with L1-Norm
   optimization.},

Abstract = {Transferring knowledge from one domain to another has gained a lot of
   attention among scientists in recent years. Transfer learning is a
   machine learning approach aiming to exploit the knowledge retrieved from
   one problem for improving the predictive performance of a learning model
   for a different but related problem. This is particularly the case when
   there is a lack of data regarding a problem, but there is plenty of data
   about another related one. To this end, the present study intends to
   investigate the effectiveness of transfer learning from deep neural
   networks for the task of students' performance prediction in higher
   education. Since building predictive models in the Educational Data
   Mining field through transfer learning methods has been poorly studied
   so far, we consider this study as an important step in this direction.
   Therefore, a plethora of experiments were conducted based on data
   originating from five compulsory courses of two undergraduate programs.
   The experimental results demonstrate that the prognosis of students at
   risk of failure can be achieved with satisfactory accuracy in most
   cases, provided that datasets of students who have attended other
   related courses are available.},

Abstract = {Educational data mining is widely deployed to extract valuable
   information and patterns from academic data. This research explores new
   features that can help predict the future performance of undergraduate
   students and identify at -risk students early on. It answers some
   crucial and intuitive questions that are not addressed by previous
   studies. Most of the existing research is conducted on data from 2-3
   years in an absolute grading scheme. We examined the effects of
   historical academic data of 15 years on predictive modelling.
   Additionally, we explore the performance of undergrad uate students in a
   relative grading scheme and examine the effects of grades in core
   courses and initial semesters on future performances. As a pilot study,
   we analyzed the academic performance of Computer Science university
   students. Many exciting discoveries were made; the duration and size of
   the historical data play a significant role in predicting future
   performance, mainly due to changes in curriculum, faculty, society, and
   evolving trends. Furthermore, predicting grades in ad vanced courses
   based on initial pre -requisite courses is challenging in a relative
   grading scheme, as students' performance depends not only on their
   efforts but also on their peers. In short, educational data mining can
   come to the rescue by uncovering valuable insights from academic data to
   predict future performances and identify the critical areas that need
   significant improvement.},

Abstract = {Deep learning (DL) techniques have shown good potential in building
   favorable predictive models in e-learning environments. It is important
   to build a DL-based, fine-grained student performance prediction model
   to predict students' outcomes and learning status at every stage of
   their course, rather than merely predicting the students' final score
   and drop-out rate, which is referred to as coarse-grained performance.
   In this paper, we tackle the problem of fine-grained student performance
   prediction in an online course using DL-based long sequence generation
   by formulating the students' feature as a matrix where elements in
   certain parts are missing. We propose an adaptive sparse self-attention
   network to generate the missing values and simultaneously predict the
   fine-grained performance. The matrix representation of the features
   facilitates position-wise feature selection, which helps to find the
   most correlated components from the past learning stage, leading to an
   embedding with both the original features and their spatial
   relationships. We build a deep neural network model with several sparse
   self-attention layers stacked together to achieve sequence generation.
   Experimental studies on three real-world datasets from different
   elearning platforms demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of our
   proposed method. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Ascertaining the Online Learning Behaviors and Formative Assessments
   Affecting Students' Academic Performance during the COVID-19 Pandemic: A
   Case Study of a Computer Science Course},
Journal = {EDUCATION SCIENCES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Prior education research has focused on using learning analytics to
   predict the academic performance of Massive Online Learning Courses
   (MOOCs) and e- learning courses in universities. There is limited
   research on online learning that has been transitioned from physical
   classes and that has continued to use active learning approaches in an
   online environment. This study aims to determine the variables affecting
   students' academic performance for a computing course in a
   research-intense university during the COVID-19 pandemic. Variables that
   are indicative of self-regulated learning such as time management,
   frequency of accessing learning materials and the Learning Management
   System (LMS), participation in assessment activities and discussions,
   and the results of formative assessments were extracted from the LMS
   reports and log files to predict the students' total marks and final
   exam results. The findings revealed that good time management and active
   participation are important for academic success. The results also
   supported the model for the early prediction of summative assessment
   performance using formative assessment results. Additionally, this study
   concludes that the gap in predictive power between formative assessment
   results and online learning behaviors is small. This research is
   considered unique because it demonstrates predictive models for
   students' academic success for an institution that was forced to
   transition from physical to online learning. It highlights the
   importance of self-regulated learning behavior and formative assessments
   in the contemporary era.},

Abstract = {Recent advances in sensor technology, including eye-gaze tracking, have
   introduced the opportunity to incorporate gaze into student modelling
   within an embodied learning context. The produced multimodal data is
   used to uncover cognitive, behavioural, and affective processes during
   the embodied learning activity. However, the use of eye-tracking data
   presenting visual attention to understand students' behaviours and
   learning performance during engagement with tangible learning activity
   is rather unexplored. Therefore, this paper explores the integration of
   eye-gaze features to predict students' learning performance during an
   embodied activity. We present an in-situ study where 110 primary school
   students (aged 8-9 years), solved a tangible learning activity for
   learning human body anatomy. During the experiment, students' learning
   experience was monitored by collecting their eye-tracking data, learning
   profiles, academic performances, and time to complete the activity. We
   applied predictive modelling to identify the synergies between eye-gaze
   features and students' learning performance. The obtained results
   suggest that combining eye-gaze tracking with learning traces and
   behaviour attributes may support an accurate prediction of students'
   learning performance. This research sheds light on the opportunities
   offered in the intersection of eye-gaze tracking with learning traces,
   and its possible contribution to investigating students' behaviour
   within an embodied learning context.},

Title = {ANN-LSTM: A deep learning model for early student performance prediction
   in MOOC},
Journal = {HELIYON},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {9},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Learning Analytics aims to discover the class of students' performance
   over time. This helps in-structors make in-time interventions but,
   discovering the students' performance class in virtual learning
   environments consider a challenge due to distance constraints. Many
   studies, which applied to Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) datasets,
   built predictive models but, these models were applied to specific
   courses and students and classify students into binary classes.
   Moreover, their results were obtained at the end of the course period
   thus delaying making in -time interventions. To bridge this gap, this
   study proposes a day-wise multi-class model to pre-dict students'
   performance using Artificial Neural Network and Long Short-Term Memory,
   named ANN-LSTM. To check the validity of this model, two baseline
   models, the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Gated Recurrent Unit
   (GRU), were conducted and compared with ANN-LSTM in this context.
   Additionally, the results of ANN-LSTM were compared with the
   state-of-the-art models in terms of accuracy. The results show that the
   ANN-LSTM model obtained the best re-sults among baseline models. The
   accuracy obtained by ANN-LSTM was about 70\% at the end of the third
   month of the course and outperforms RNN and GRU models which obtained
   53\% and 57\%, respectively. Also, the ANN-LSTM model obtained the best
   accuracy results with enhancement rates of about 6-14\% when compared
   with state-of-the-art models. This highlights the ability of LSTM as a
   time series model to make early predictions for student performance in
   MOOC taking benefit of its architecture and ability to keep latent
   dependencies.},

Title = {Assignments as Influential Factor to Improve the Prediction of Student
   Performance in Online Courses},

Abstract = {Studies on the prediction of student success in distance learning have
   explored mainly demographics factors and student interactions with the
   virtual learning environments. However, it is remarkable that a very
   limited number of studies use information about the assignments
   submitted by students as influential factor to predict their academic
   achievement. This paper aims to explore the real importance of
   assignment information for solving students' performance prediction in
   distance learning and evaluate the beneficial effect of including this
   information. We investigate and compare this factor and its potential
   from two information representation approaches: the traditional
   representation based on single instances and a more flexible
   representation based on Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), focus on
   handle weakly labeled data. A comparative study is carried out using the
   Open University Learning Analytics dataset, one of the most important
   public datasets in education provided by one of the greatest online
   universities of United Kingdom. The study includes a wide set of
   different types of machine learning algorithms addressed from the two
   data representation commented, showing that algorithms using only
   information about assignments with a representation based on MIL can
   outperform more than 20\% the accuracy with respect to a representation
   based on single instance learning. Thus, it is concluded that applying
   an appropriate representation that eliminates the sparseness of data
   allows to show the relevance of a factor, such as the assignments
   submitted, not widely used to date to predict students' academic
   performance. Moreover, a comparison with previous works on the same
   dataset and problem shows that predictive models based on MIL using only
   assignments information obtain competitive results compared to previous
   studies that include other factors to predict students performance.},

Title = {Implementing AutoML in Educational Data Mining for Prediction Tasks},

Abstract = {Educational Data Mining (EDM) has emerged over the last two decades,
   concerning with the development and implementation of data mining
   methods in order to facilitate the analysis of vast amounts of data
   originating from a wide variety of educational contexts. Predicting
   students' progression and learning outcomes, such as dropout,
   performance and course grades, is regarded among the most important
   tasks of the EDM field. Therefore, applying appropriate machine learning
   algorithms for building accurate predictive models is of outmost
   importance for both educators and data scientists. Considering the
   high-dimensional input space and the complexity of machine learning
   algorithms, the process of building accurate and robust learning models
   requires advanced data science skills, while is time-consuming and
   error-prone in most cases. In addition, choosing the proper method for a
   given problem formulation and configuring the optimal parameters' values
   for a specific model is a demanding task, whilst it is often very
   difficult to understand and explain the produced results. In this
   context, the main purpose of the present study is to examine the
   potential use of advanced machine learning strategies on educational
   settings from the perspective of hyperparameter optimization. More
   specifically, we investigate the effectiveness of automated Machine
   Learning (autoML) for the task of predicting students' learning outcomes
   based on their participation in online learning platforms. At the same
   time, we limit the search space to tree-based and rule-based models in
   order to achieving transparent and interpretable results. To this end, a
   plethora of experiments were carried out, revealing that autoML tools
   achieve consistently superior results. Hopefully our work will help
   nonexpert users (e.g., educators and instructors) in the field of EDM to
   conduct experiments with appropriate automated parameter configurations,
   thus achieving highly accurate and comprehensible results.},

Title = {Enhancing student performance in African smart cities: a web-based
   approach through advanced ensemble modeling and genetic feature
   optimization},
Journal = {DATA \& POLICY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {6},
Abstract = {In the burgeoning landscape of African smart cities, education stands as
   a cornerstone for sustainable development and unlocking future
   potential. Accurate student performance prediction holds immense social
   importance, enabling early intervention, improved learning outcomes, and
   equitable access to quality education, aligning with sustainable
   development goals. Traditional models often falter in Africa due to
   imbalanced datasets and irrelevant features. This research leverages
   machine learning in Nigerian classrooms to predict underperforming
   students. Techniques like synthetic minority oversampling, edited
   nearest neighbors, and the Boruta algorithm for feature selection,
   alongside genetic algorithms for efficiency, enhance model performance.
   The ensemble models achieve AUCs of 90-99.7\%, - 99.7\%, effectively
   separating low-performing and high-performing students. Implemented via
   Streamlit and Heroku, these models support real-time, data-driven
   decisions, enhancing early intervention, personalized learning, and
   informing policy and public service design. This ensures equitable
   education and a brighter future across Africa. By leveraging ML, this
   research empowers universities to support struggling students, optimize
   educational costs, and promote inclusive development, fostering
   data-driven decision-making and resource allocation optimization.
   Ultimately, this research paves the way for a future where data empowers
   education within African smart cities, unlocking the full potential of
   data-driven solutions and ensuring equitable educational opportunities
   across the continent. Policy Significance Statement The research
   explores machine learning techniques in Nigerian classrooms, creating
   predictive models to identify underperforming students. This aids
   universities globally in supporting struggling students, optimizing
   educational costs, and fostering inclusive development. Leveraging the
   synthetic minority oversampling and edited nearest neighbors (SMOTE-ENN)
   - ENN) for imbalanced data, Boruta for feature selection, and genetic
   algorithms to enhance efficiency. Beyond technical advancements, the
   research translates findings into real world impact via a Streamlit and
   Heroku web app. This empowers universities worldwide to customize
   models, view real-time results, and make informed, data-driven
   decisions. Ultimately, this work empowers stakeholders to utilize data
   science for equitable and impactful education in African smart cities,
   fostering sustainable development.},

Abstract = {PurposePredicting student performance is crucial in educational settings
   to identify and support students who may need additional help or
   resources. Understanding and predicting student performance is essential
   for educators to provide targeted support and guidance to students. By
   analyzing various factors like attendance, study habits, grades, and
   participation, teachers can gain insights into each student's academic
   progress. This information helps them tailor their teaching methods to
   meet the individual needs of students, ensuring a more personalized and
   effective learning experience. By identifying patterns and trends in
   student performance, educators can intervene early to address any
   challenges and help students acrhieve their full potential. However, the
   complexity of human behavior and learning patterns makes it difficult to
   accurately forecast how a student will perform. Additionally, the
   availability and quality of data can vary, impacting the accuracy of
   predictions. Despite these obstacles, continuous improvement in data
   collection methods and the development of more robust predictive models
   can help address these challenges and enhance the accuracy and
   effectiveness of student performance predictions. However, the
   scalability of the existing models to different educational settings and
   student populations can be a hurdle. Ensuring that the models are
   adaptable and effective across diverse environments is crucial for their
   widespread use and impact. To implement a student's performance-based
   learning recommendation scheme for predicting the student's capabilities
   and suggesting better materials like papers, books, videos, and
   hyperlinks according to their needs. It enhances the performance of
   higher education.Design/methodology/approachThus, a predictive approach
   for student achievement is presented using deep learning. At the
   beginning, the data is accumulated from the standard database. Next, the
   collected data undergoes a stage where features are carefully selected
   using the Modified Red Deer Algorithm (MRDA). After that, the selected
   features are given to the Deep Ensemble Networks (DEnsNet), in which
   techniques such as Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Deep Conditional Random
   Field (DCRF), and Residual Long Short-Term Memory (Res-LSTM) are
   utilized for predicting the student performance. In this case, the
   parameters within the DEnsNet network are finely tuned by the MRDA
   algorithm. Finally, the results from the DEnsNet network are obtained
   using a superior method that delivers the final prediction outcome.
   Following that, the Adaptive Generative Adversarial Network (AGAN) is
   introduced for recommender systems, with these parameters optimally
   selected using the MRDA algorithm. Lastly, the method for predicting
   student performance is evaluated numerically and compared to traditional
   methods to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
   approach.FindingsThe accuracy of the developed model is 7.66\%, 9.91\%,
   5.3\%, and 3.53\% more than HHO-DEnsNet, ROA-DEnsNet, GTO-DEnsNet, and
   AOA-DEnsNet for dataset-1, and 7.18\%, 7.54\%, 5.43\% and 3\% enhanced
   than HHO-DEnsNet, ROA-DEnsNet, GTO-DEnsNet, and AOA-DEnsNet for
   dataset-2.Originality/valueThe developed model recommends the
   appropriate learning materials within a short period to improve
   student's learning ability.},

Abstract = {Utilisation of Educational Data Mining (EDM) can be useful in predicting
   academic performance of students to mitigate student attrition rate,
   allocation of resources, and aid in decision-making processes for higher
   education institution. This article uses a large dataset from the
   Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) consisting of
   612,004 participants from 79 countries, supported by the machine
   learning approach to predict student academic performance. Unlike most
   of the literature that is confined to one geographical location or with
   limited datasets and factors, this article studies other factors that
   contribute to academic success and uses student data from various
   backgrounds. The accuracy of the proposed model to predict student
   performance achieved 74\%. It is discovered that Gradient Boosted Trees
   surpass the other classification models that were considered (Logistic
   Regression, Na \& iuml;ve Bayes, Deep Learning, Random Forest, Fast
   Large Margin, Generalised Linear Model, Decision Tree and Support Vector
   Machine). Reading skills and habits are of the highest importance in
   predicting the academic performance of students.},

Abstract = {Predicting student performance has become a strategic challenge for
   universities, essential for increasing student success rates, retention,
   and tackling dropout rates. However, the large volume of educational
   data complicates this task. Therefore, many research projects have
   focused on using Machine Learning techniques to predict student success.
   This study aims to propose a performance prediction model for students
   at IBN ZOHR University in Morocco. We employ a combination of Random
   Forest and Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation
   (RFECV-RF) for optimal feature selection. Using these features, we build
   classification models with several Machine Learning algorithms,
   including AdaBoost, Logistic Regression (LR), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-
   NN), Naive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Decision Trees
   (DT). Our results show that the SVM model, using the 8 features selected
   by RFECV-RF, outperforms the other classifiers with an accuracy of 87\%.
   This demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of our feature
   selection method and the superiority of the SVM model in predicting
   student performance.},

Abstract = {Student retention is a widely recognized challenge in the educational
   community to assist the institutes in the formation of appropriate and
   effective pedagogical interventions. This study intends to predict the
   students at risk of low performance during an on-going course, those at
   risk of graduating late than the tentative timeline. and predicts the
   capacity of students in a campus. The data constitutes of demographics,
   learning, academic, and education-related attributes that are suitable
   to deploy various machine learning algorithms for the prediction of
   at-risk students. For class balancing, synthetic minority over sampling
   technique is also applied to eliminate the imbalance in the academic
   award-gap performances and late/timely graduates. Results reveal the
   effectiveness of the deployed techniques with long short-term memory
   (LSTM) outperforming other models for early prediction of at-risk
   students. The main contribution of this work is a machine learning
   approach capable of enhancing the academic decision-making related to
   student performance.},

Abstract = {Technology-enhanced learning supported by virtual learning environments
   (VLEs) facilitates tutors and students. VLE platforms contain a wealth
   of information that can be used to mine insight regarding students'
   learning behaviour and relationships between behaviour and academic
   performance, as well as to model data-driven decision-making. This study
   introduces a system that we termed ASIST: a novel Attention-aware
   convolutional Stacked BiLSTM network for student representation learning
   to predict their performance. ASIST exploits student academic registry,
   VLE click stream, and midterm continuous assessment information for
   their behaviour representation learning. ASIST jointly learns the
   student representation using five behaviour vectors. It processes the
   four sequential behaviour vectors using a separate stacked bidirectional
   long short term memory (LSTM) network. A deep convolutional neural
   network models the diurnal weekly interaction behaviour. It also employs
   the attention mechanism to assign weight to features based on their
   importance. Next, five encoded feature vectors are concatenated with the
   assessment information, and, finally, a softmax layer predicts the
   high-performer (H), moderate-performer (M), and at-risk (F) categories
   of students. We evaluate ASIST over three datasets from an Irish
   university, considering five evaluation metrics. ASIST achieves an area
   under the curve (AUC) score of 0.86 to 0.90 over the three datasets. It
   outperforms three baseline deep learning models and four traditional
   classification models. We also found that the attention mechanism has a
   slight impact on ASIST's performance. The ablation analysis reveals that
   weekly event count has the greatest impact on ASIST, whereas diurnal
   weekly interaction has the least impact. The early prediction using the
   first seven weeks of data achieves an AUC of 0.83 up to 0.89 over the
   three datasets. In yearly analysis, ASIST performs best over the 2018/19
   dataset and worst over the 2020/21 dataset.},

Title = {Educational Big Data: Predictions, Applications and Challenges},
Journal = {BIG DATA RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {26},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {Educational big data is becoming a strategic educational asset,
   exceptionally significant in advancing educational reform. The term
   educational big data stems from the rapidly growing educational data
   development, including students' inherent attributes, learning behavior,
   and psychological state. Educational big data has many applications that
   can be used for educational administration, teaching innovation, and
   research management. The representative examples of such applications
   are student academic performance prediction, employment recommendation,
   and financial support for low-income students. Different empirical
   studies have shown that it is possible to predict student performance in
   the courses during the next term. Predictive research for the higher
   education stage has become an attractive area of study since it allowed
   us to predict student behavior. In this survey, we will review
   predictive research, its applications, and its challenges. We first
   introduce the significance and background of educational big data.
   Second, we review the students' academic performance prediction
   research, such as factors influencing students' academic performance,
   predicting models, evaluating indices. Third, we introduce the
   applications of educational big data such as prediction, recommendation,
   and evaluation. Finally, we investigate challenging research issues in
   this area. This discussion aims to provide a comprehensive overview of
   educational big data. (C) 2021 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Title = {An Adaptive Feature Selection Algorithm for Student Performance
   Prediction},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Pages = {75577-75598},
Abstract = {Educational Data Mining (EDM) is used to ameliorate the teaching and
   learning process by analyzing and classifying data that can be applied
   to predict the students' academic performance, and students' dropout
   rate, as well as instructors' performance. The prediction of student
   performance is complicated by the vast and diverse range of variables
   from academic records to behavioral and health metrics. In this paper,
   we have introduced a new Adaptive Feature Selection Algorithm (AFSA) by
   amalgamating an ensemble approach for initial feature ranking with
   normalized mean ranking from five distinct methods to enhance
   robustness. The proposed method iteratively selects the best features by
   adjusting its threshold based on each feature's rank to ensure
   significant contributions to model accuracy and also effectively reduces
   dataset complexity. We have tested the performance of the proposed
   feature selection algorithm using five machine learning classifiers:
   Logistic Regression (LR), K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Support Vector
   Machine (SVM), Na \& iuml;ve Bayes (NB) classifier, and Decision Tree
   (DT) classifier on four student performance datasets. The experimental
   results highlight the proposed method significantly decreases feature
   count by an average feature reduction factor of 5.7, significantly
   streamlining datasets while maintaining competitive cross-validation
   accuracy, marking it as a valuable tool in the field of educational data
   analytics.},

Abstract = {The application of machine learning (ML) has grown and is now used to
   enhance learning outcomes. In blended classroom settings, ML, emerging
   smartphones and wearable technologies are commonly used to improve
   teaching and learning. The combination of these advanced technologies
   and ML plays a crucial role in enhancing real-time feedback quality.
   However, there are abundant scopes of improvement and strong need for
   further careful investigations in this area. We propose an ML-based
   intelligent real-time feedback system to address current research
   challenges for blended classrooms. The proposed system provides
   real-time feedback to students and teachers. We build an Android
   application for our intelligent feedback interfaces. The user interfaces
   use students' academic performance prediction models with real-time
   states and dynamic feedback timings based on historic feedback
   statistics. In addition, the feedback scheduling algorithms, choices of
   peripheral devices for real-time feedback, and feedback modalities to
   optimize fatigue make our system interfaces intelligent and novel. The
   end users well-received the intelligent features and technology of the
   proposed system. Our empirical findings indicate that unique design
   elements, such as dynamic timing, choice of peripheral devices, and
   modalities of real-time feedback, are crucial in integrating the system
   with blended classes. The intelligent characteristics of the proposed
   system have been appreciated by a large proportion of the end-users
   (90.90\% of teachers and 84.21\% of students) for use in real-time
   blended classroom environments. The higher comparative system usability
   scale (SUS) scores with benchmarks show real promise of the system
   design.},

Title = {Student Performance Prediction Approach Based on Educational Data Mining},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Pages = {131260-131272},
Abstract = {Predicting student performance is crucial for improving students' future
   academic achievements. Within student groups, common characteristics can
   reveal trends in overall student learning. Most studies tend to focus on
   the common characteristics of students but ignore their individual
   characteristics. However, individual characteristics are important in
   promoting student academic performance because they allow us to
   understand the unique learning performances of each student. To address
   this issue, this paper proposes a student performance prediction
   approach. First, addressing the problem of difficulty in effectively
   dividing the student samples under multi-dimensional discrete data, we
   propose a method that combines the relationship matrix-based bipartite
   network approach (RMBN) with Louvain clustering. Second, the hybrid
   neural network model based on a relationship matrix (RMHNN) is proposed
   to address the problem that discrete types of features are difficult to
   fit by algorithms. The results show that the implementation of the model
   on real student data can effectively predict student performance with an
   accuracy of 93.1\% and an F1-score of 90.45\%. With the model's
   predicted student performance, educators can provide individualized
   support and assistance to each student.},

Abstract = {Successful prediction of student performance has significant impact to
   many stakeholders, including students, teachers and educational
   institutes. In this domain, it is equally important to have accurate and
   explainable predictions, where accuracy refers to the correctness of the
   predicted value, and explainability refers to the understandability of
   the prediction made. In this systematic review, we investigate
   explainable models of student performance prediction from 2015 to 2020.
   We analyze and synthesize primary studies, and group them based on nine
   dimensions. Our analysis revealed the need for more studies on
   explainable student performance prediction models, where both accuracy
   and explainability are properly quantified and evaluated.},

Title = {Multiple Features Fusion Attention Mechanism Enhanced Deep Knowledge
   Tracing for Student Performance Prediction},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {194894-194903},
Abstract = {Student performance prediction is a fundamental task in online learning
   systems, which aims to provide students with access to active learning.
   Generally, student performance prediction is achieved by tracing the
   evolution of each students knowledge states via a series of learning
   activities. Every learning activity record has two types of feature
   data: student behavior and exercise features. However, most methods use
   features that are related to exercises, such as correctness and
   concepts, while other student behavior features are usually ignored. The
   few studies that have focused on student behavior features through
   subjective manual selection argue that different student behavior
   features can be used in an equivalent manner to predict student
   performance. In this paper, we assume that the integration of student
   behavior features and exercise features is crucial to improve the
   precision of prediction, and each feature has a different impact on
   student performance. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel framework
   for student performance prediction by making full use of both student
   behavior features and exercise features and combining the attention
   mechanism with the knowledge tracing model. Specifically, we first
   exploit machine learning to capture feature representation
   automatically. Then, a fusion attention mechanism based on recurrent
   neural network architecture is used for student performance prediction.
   Extensive experiments on a real-world dataset show the effectiveness and
   practicability of our approach. The accuracy of our method is up to
   98\%, which is superior to previous methods.},

Title = {Predicting and Interpreting Student Performance Using Ensemble Models

Abstract = {In several areas, including education, the use of machine learning, such
   as artificial neural networks, has resulted in significant improvements
   in predicting tasks. The opacity of these models is one of the problems
   with their use. Prediction models that may offer valuable insights while
   still being simple to comprehend are preferred by decision-makers in
   education. Hence, this study suggests an approach that improves the
   previous student performance prediction by enhancing performance and
   explaining why a student's performance is attaining a certain score. A
   prediction model was proposed and tested using machine learning models.
   Our models outperform previous work models developed on the same
   dataset. Using a combined framework of data level and algorithm
   approaches, the proposed model achieves an accuracy of over 98\%,
   inplying a 20.3\% improvement compared with previous work models. As a
   balancing technique for upsampling data, we use the default strategy of
   synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) to oversample all
   classes to the number of examples in the majority class. We also use
   ensemble methods. For tuning the parameters, we use a simple grid search
   algorithm provided by scikit to estimate the optimal parameters of our
   model. This hyperparameter optimization along with a ten-fold
   cross-validation process demonstrates the dependability of the novel
   model. In addition, a novel visual and intuitive technique is used to
   help determine which factors most influence the score which helps to
   interpret and understand the entire model and visualizes feature
   attributions at the observation level for the machine learning model.
   Therefore, SHAP values are a powerful tool that should be incorporated
   within the student performance prediction framework by obtaining the
   prediction and explanation created through the experiment, educators can
   recognize students at risk early and provide suitable exhortation in an
   auspicious manner.},

Title = {Preference Cognitive Diagnosis for Student Performance Prediction},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {219775-219787},
Abstract = {Knowledge states modeling is a fundamental issue in online education.
   One of its tasks is to discover the potential knowledge capacity of
   students for predicting their performance (i.e., scores on exercises).
   Current studies either depend on cognitive diagnosis approaches or apply
   collaborative filtering. However, the prediction accuracy of traditional
   cognitive diagnosis is insufficient, and collaborative filtering has
   difficulty ensuring the interpretability of prediction. Actually,
   students usually read some auxiliary text learning materials that they
   are interested in, namely, preferred learning material, to consolidate
   what they have learned. Preference cognitive diagnosis means that the
   preferred learning materials can reflect the students' knowledge states
   (i.e., proficiency for knowledge concepts) to some extent, which is
   beneficial for predicting students' performance. Therefore, we propose a
   preference cognitive diagnosis method (PreferenceCD) to model students'
   knowledge states. Specifically, we first design the Direct-Indirect
   method to acquire students' preferred learning materials. This method
   mines important information from students' reading content that can
   reflect their preference for learning materials to acquire those
   preferred learning materials directly. Moreover, it discovers preferred
   learning materials indirectly by analyzing the similarity of students'
   learning behaviors during the reading process. Subsequently, we
   calculate students' preference degree for knowledge concepts based on
   the acquired preferred learning materials and diagnose their proficiency
   for knowledge concepts by applying a cognitive diagnosis model. After
   that, we combine the above two aspects to model students' knowledge
   states and further predict their scores on exercises. The experimental
   results on a real-world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of
   PreferenceCD with both accuracy and interpretability. The accuracy, root
   mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE) of PreferenceCD
   are 0.7614, 0.4805, and 0.2386, respectively, which outperforms related
   works by about 2-12\% in terms of these evaluation metrics.},

Title = {Early Predicting of Students Performance in Higher Education},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Pages = {27579-27589},
Abstract = {Students learning performance is one of the core components for
   assessing any educational systems. Students performance is very crucial
   in tackling issues of learning process and one of the important matters
   to measure learning outcomes. The ability to use data knowledge to
   improve education systems has led to the development of the field of
   research known as educational data mining (EDM). EDM is the creation of
   techniques to investigate data gathered from educational settings,
   allowing for a more thorough and accurate understanding of students and
   the improvement of educational outcomes for them. The use of machine
   learning (ML) technology has increased significantly in recent years.
   Researchers and teachers can use the measurements of success, failure,
   dropout, and more provided by the discipline of data mining in education
   to predict and simulate education processes. Therefore, this work
   presents an analysis of students performance using data mining methods.
   The paper presents both clustering and classification techniques to
   identify the impact of students performance at early stage with on the
   GPA. For the clustering technique, the paper uses dimensionality
   reduction mechanism by T-SNE algorithm with various factors at early
   stage such as admission scores and first level courses, academic
   achievement tests (AAT) and general aptitude tests (GAT) in order to
   explore the relationship between these factors and GPA's. For the
   classification technique, the paper presents experiments on different
   machine learning models on predicting student performance at early
   stages using different features including courses' grades and admission
   tests' scores. We use different assessment metrics to evaluate the
   quality of the models. The results suggest that educational systems can
   mitigate the risks of students failures at the early stages.},

Title = {Modern Artificial Intelligence Model Development for Undergraduate
   Student Performance Prediction: An Investigation on Engineering
   Mathematics Courses},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {8},
Pages = {136697-136724},
Abstract = {A computationally efficient artificial intelligence (AI) model called
   Extreme Learning Machines (ELM) is adopted to analyze patterns embedded
   in continuous assessment to model the weighted score (WS) and the
   examination (EX) score in engineering mathematics courses at an
   Australian regional university. The student performance data taken over
   a six-year period in multiple courses ranging from the mid- to the
   advanced level and a diverse course offering mode (i.e., on-campus, ONC,
   and online, ONL) are modelled by ELM and further benchmarked against
   competing models: random forest (RF) and Volterra. With the assessments
   and examination marks as key predictors of WS (leading to a grade in the
   mid-level course), ELM (with respect to RF and Volterra) outperformed
   its counterpart models both for the ONC and the ONL offer. This
   generated relative prediction error in the testing phase, of only
   0.74\%, compared to about 3.12\% and 1.06\%, respectively, while for the
   ONL offer, the prediction errors were only 0.51\% compared to about
   3.05\% and 0.70\%. In modelling the student performance in advanced
   engineering mathematics course, ELM registered slightly larger errors:
   0.77\% (vs. 22.23\% and 1.87\%) for ONC and 0.54\% (vs. 4.08\% and
   1.31\%) for the ONL offer. This study advocates a pioneer implementation
   of a robust AI methodology to uncover relationships among student
   learning variables, developing teaching and learning intervention and
   course health checks to address issues related to graduate outcomes, and
   student learning attributes in the higher education sector.},

Title = {The Role of Machine Learning in Identifying Students At-Risk and
   Minimizing Failure},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Pages = {1224-1243},
Abstract = {Education is very important for students' future success. The
   performance of students can be supported by the extra assignments and
   projects given by the instructors for students with low performance.
   However, a major problem is that students at-risk cannot be identified
   early. This situation is being investigated by various researchers using
   Machine Learning techniques. Machine learning is used in a variety of
   areas and has also begun to be used to identify students at-risk early
   and to provide support by instructors. This research paper discusses the
   performance results found using Machine learning algorithms to identify
   at-risk students and minimize student failure. The main purpose of this
   project is to create a hybrid model using the ensemble stacking method
   and to predict at-risk students using this model. We used machine
   learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Decision Tree,
   K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, AdaBoost Classifier and
   Logistic Regression in this project. The performance of each machine
   learning algorithm presented in the project was measured with various
   metrics. Thus, the hybrid model by combining algorithms that give the
   best prediction results is presented in this study. The data set
   containing the demographic and academic information of the students was
   used to train and test the model. In addition, a web application
   developed for the effective use of the hybrid model and for obtaining
   prediction results is presented in the report. In the proposed method,
   it has been realized that stratified k-fold cross validation and
   hyperparameter optimization techniques increased the performance of the
   models. The hybrid ensemble model was tested with a combination of two
   different datasets to understand the importance of the data features. In
   first combination, the accuracy of the hybrid model was obtained as
   94.8\% by using both demographic and academic data. In the second
   combination, when only academic data was used, the accuracy of the
   hybrid model increased to 98.4\%. This study focuses on predicting the
   performance of at-risk students early. Thus, teachers will be able to
   provide extra assistance to students with low performance.},

Abstract = {Based on student's cognitive structure, the cognitive diagnostic models
   (CDMs) can reveal the potential relationships among the student's
   knowledge level, test item features and the corresponding item scores,
   and then predict each student's future performance. However, due to the
   simplistic prior information and deficient cognitive mechanism, most of
   the existing CDMs have limited prediction performance. To address the
   issues, we propose the multivariate cognitive response framework
   (MvCRF). We first collect student's learning activity logs to calculate
   the corresponding effort trait. Considering both student's ability trait
   and effort trait, MvCRF then introduces the compensation mechanism to
   calculate student's knowledge level. In addition, we introduce not only
   the slip and guessing parameters in prediction but also the skill
   weakness parameter related with the student's knowledge level and the
   importance of each skill on solving specific item. Experimental results
   on both simulation study and real-data application on MOOC demonstrate
   that MvCRF achieves better prediction performance, robustness and
   interpretability than the baseline CDMs.},

Abstract = {Contribution: This article explored blended learning by implementing a
   student-centered teaching method based on the flipped classroom and
   small private online course (SPOC). The impact of general online
   learning behavior on student performance was analyzed. This work is
   practical and provides enlightenment for learning analysis and
   individualized teaching in blended learning. Background: Providing
   individualized teaching in a large class is an effective way to improve
   teaching quality, but the traditional teaching method makes it difficult
   for teachers to learn about each student's learning situation. Blended
   learning offers the possibility of individualized teaching for teachers.
   The combination of flipped classroom and SPOC is a good way to implement
   blended learning, but few studies have verified the predictability of
   learning performance in such a scenario to explore individualized
   teaching. Intended Outcomes: Students' behavior in blended learning can
   be used to predict their learning outcomes, and the implementation
   method is reproducible. Teachers can implement individualized teaching
   in blended learning. Application Design: The learning activities were
   designed and reconstructed to create a blended learning scenario, data
   that depict students' learning behavior were collected and used to
   predict their performance by a multiple regression model. Student
   performance was measured by the final offline exam, and its
   predictability in the 1/4, 1/2, and 3/4 semester was tested for early
   intervention. Findings: The results show that students' online behavior
   can be predictors of their performance, and with the advance of the
   course, the predicted results are more stable and reliable.},

Abstract = {Student cognitive modeling plays an important role in the rapid
   development of educational data mining research. It aims to discover
   students' proficiency in knowledge concepts as well as to predict
   students' performance in conducting exercises. Studies in the past few
   years have been mainly centered around two types of techniques:
   cognitive diagnosis models and data mining approaches. Cognitive
   diagnosis models focus on students' cognitive states and assess their
   knowledge concept proficiency through handcrafted features. The
   subjective features may trigger cascading errors in the students'
   performance prediction. On the other hand, data mining techniques, e.g.,
   matrix factorization methods, achieve high prediction accuracy by
   directly modeling the students' exercising process. It lacks measuring
   the students' knowledge concept proficiency. To address the dilemma of
   the aforementioned methods, in this paper, we propose a scalable
   non-negative matrix co-factorization (SNMCF) model by jointly modeling
   the students' knowledge states and their exercising process. SNMCF can
   achieve high accuracy in predicting students' exercise performance while
   modeling their states of knowledge concepts in a given domain. We
   conduct extensive experiments on several real-world datasets, including
   large sparse ones, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our new approach
   in terms of prediction accuracy, cognitive diagnostic ability, and
   scalability.},

Title = {Student Performance Predictions for Advanced Engineering Mathematics
   Course With New Multivariate Copula Models},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Pages = {45112-45136},
Abstract = {Engineering Mathematics requires that problem-solving should be
   implemented through ongoing assessments; hence the prediction of student
   performance using continuous assessments remains an important task for
   engineering educators, mainly to monitor and improve their teaching
   practice. This paper develops probabilistic models to predict weighted
   scores (WS, or the overall mark leading to a final grade) for
   face-to-face (on-campus) and web-based (online) Advanced Engineering
   Mathematics students at an Australian regional university over a 6-year
   period (2013-2018). We fitted parametric and non-parametric D-vine
   copula models utilizing multiple quizzes, assignments and examination
   score results to construct and validate the predicted WS in
   independently test datasets. The results are interpreted in terms of the
   probability of whether a student's continuous performance (i.e.,
   individually or jointly with other counterpart assessments) is likely to
   lead to a passing grade conditional upon joint performance in students'
   quizzes and assignment scores. The results indicate that the newly
   developed D-vine model, benchmarked against a linear regression model,
   can generate accurate grade predictions, and particularly handle the
   problem of low or high scores (tail dependence) compared with a
   conventional model for both face-to-face, and web-based students.
   Accordingly, the findings advocate the practical utility of joint copula
   models that capture the dependence structure in engineering mathematics
   students' marks achieved. This therefore, provide insights through
   learning analytic methods to support an engineering educator's teaching
   decisions. The implications are on better supporting engineering
   mathematics students' success and retention, developing evidence-based
   strategies consistent with engineering graduate requirements through
   improved teaching and learning, and identifying/addressing the risk of
   failure through early intervention. The proposed methods can guide an
   engineering educator's practice by investigating joint influences of
   engineering problem-solving assessments on their student's grades.},

Title = {Predicting Student Performance Using Data Mining and Learning Analytics
   Techniques: A Systematic Literature Review},

Abstract = {Featured Application
   The herein survey is among the first research efforts to synthesize the
   intelligent models and paradigms applied in education to predict the
   attainment of student learning outcomes, which represent a proxy for
   student performance. The survey identifies several key challenges and
   provides recommendations for future research in the field of educational
   data mining.
   The prediction of student academic performance has drawn considerable
   attention in education. However, although the learning outcomes are
   believed to improve learning and teaching, prognosticating the
   attainment of student outcomes remains underexplored. A decade of
   research work conducted between 2010 and November 2020 was surveyed to
   present a fundamental understanding of the intelligent techniques used
   for the prediction of student performance, where academic success is
   strictly measured using student learning outcomes. The electronic
   bibliographic databases searched include ACM, IEEE Xplore, Google
   Scholar, Science Direct, Scopus, Springer, and Web of Science.
   Eventually, we synthesized and analyzed a total of 62 relevant papers
   with a focus on three perspectives, (1) the forms in which the learning
   outcomes are predicted, (2) the predictive analytics models developed to
   forecast student learning, and (3) the dominant factors impacting
   student outcomes. The best practices for conducting systematic
   literature reviews, e.g., PICO and PRISMA, were applied to synthesize
   and report the main results. The attainment of learning outcomes was
   measured mainly as performance class standings (i.e., ranks) and
   achievement scores (i.e., grades). Regression and supervised machine
   learning models were frequently employed to classify student
   performance. Finally, student online learning activities, term
   assessment grades, and student academic emotions were the most evident
   predictors of learning outcomes. We conclude the survey by highlighting
   some major research challenges and suggesting a summary of significant
   recommendations to motivate future works in this field.},

Abstract = {Accompanied with the development of storage and processing capacity of
   modern technology, educational data increases sharply. It is difficult
   for educational researchers to derive useful information from much
   educational data. Therefore, educational data mining techniques are
   important for the development of modern education field. Recently,
   researches have demonstrated that machine learning, as an important tool
   for data mining, has shown promising performance in educational
   applications, especially in student performance prediction. However, few
   studies comprehensively compare existing machine learning methods in
   educational data. Moreover, most current studies only focus on a single
   type of educational data for student performance prediction. In this
   paper, three different types of task-oriented educational data are
   employed to investigate the performance of machine learning methods in
   different application scenarios. Specifically, seven parameter-optimized
   machine learning methods are implemented to study multiple types of
   performance prediction, including binary and multi-classification
   prediction tasks. In the experimental section, four evaluation metrics
   and visualizations are presented for a comparative study of different
   methods on three tasks, and an elaborated discussion of the experimental
   results is provided. The experimental results demonstrate that Random
   Forest has achieved superior generality on all selected datasets. In
   addition, the performance of Decision Tree and Artificial Neural Network
   models on the selected datasets indicates that they are also potential
   candidates to solve student performance prediction tasks.},

Abstract = {Many stakeholders including students, teachers, and educational
   institutions, benefit from accurately predicting student performance and
   facilitating data-driven policies. In this field, providing users with
   accurate and understandable predictions is challenging, but equally
   important. The goals of this study are multifaceted: to identify
   students at-risk; to identify differences in assessment across different
   environments; methods for assessing students; and to determine the
   relationship between teacher employment status and student achievement.
   This study performs an empirical comparison of the performance and
   efficiency of ensemble classification methods based on bagging,
   boosting, stacking, and voting for successful predictions. An ensemble
   model is developed and validated using double, triple, and quadruple
   combinations of classification algorithms using Naive Bayes, J48
   decision trees, Adaboost, logistics, and multilayer perceptron. This
   study uses primary quantitative data from the learning management system
   of a university in Pakistan to analyze the performance of these models.
   The boosted tree detection method outperforms bagged trees when the
   standard deviation is higher and the data size is large, while stacking
   is best for smaller datasets. Based on behavioral analysis results of
   students, academic advice can be given for selected case studies. These
   will help educational administrators and policymakers working in
   education to introduce new policies and curricula accordingly.},

Abstract = {Research on student performance prediction has evolved from the early
   application of statistical techniques to later use of computational
   techniques. Results in this field are varied, thus, we have to take
   advantage of previous research results. This study proposes a
   Multi-layer Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (MANFIS) for student
   performance prediction in online Higher Education settings. The MANFIS
   was trained and tested using a dataset integrated by the scores obtained
   by students in four online Higher Education courses. The MANFIS
   prediction accuracy was compared against the accuracies of Multilayer
   neural network, Radial Basis Function Neural Network, and General
   Regression Neural Network. The accuracy of the MANFIS prediction
   statistically outperformed at least one neural network (out of three
   possible) in each dataset. The Results indicate that MANFIS is an
   alternative model to predict student performance in online Higher
   Education settings.},

Abstract = {Predictive learning outcomes' models for online students can provide
   useful information to instructors to estimate students' final
   performance in the early stages of a course. Anticipating student
   performance can improve learning efficiency. Existing research models
   that analysed student data have focused on handcrafted features, but
   these models have limitations in exploring new behavioral patterns that
   indicate student performance and how they can be used in online courses.
   The clickstream data contains a significant amount of information that
   accurately describes students' learning processes, which makes it
   difficult to construct using hand-crafted features. To analyze student
   behavior effectively, we attempted to capture critical knowledge from
   the field of natural language processing (NLP) to the field of student
   performance prediction in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), owing to
   how closely they resemble each other. In this article, we propose a
   novel framework for automatically producing useful data representation
   that enhances prediction outcomes using student learning behavior
   clickstream data with a self-supervised learning approach. First, we
   developed a self-supervised clickstream pre-training setup to model
   learner click generation. Second, we adjusted these latent
   representations before applying them to a downstream supervised learning
   task. Extensive experimental results on two real-world datasets
   demonstrated that the proposed approach is effective. The combined
   approach of skip-gram embeddings with Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
   achieved the highest accuracy, particularly on the Xutangx dataset, with
   an accuracy of approximately 72.70\% and an F1-score of approximately
   81.03\%. Furthermore, when applied to the KDDCUP dataset, this
   methodology exhibited even higher performance, with an accuracy of
   80.91\% and an F1-score of 87.42\%. Our results showed the potential of
   NLP techniques to improve dropout prediction in MOOCs by extracting
   informative representations from clickstream data, allowing a deeper
   understanding of student behavior, and facilitating early intervention
   strategies.},

Abstract = {Student performance predictive analysis has played a vital role in
   education in recent years. It allows for the understanding students'
   learning behaviours, the identification of at-risk students, and the
   development of insights into teaching and learning improvement.
   Recently, many researchers have used data collected from Learning
   Management Systems to predict student performance. This study
   investigates the potential of clickstream data for this purpose. A total
   of 5341 sample students and their click behaviour data from the OULAD
   (Open University Learning Analytics Dataset) are used. The raw
   clickstream data are transformed, integrating the time and activity
   dimensions of students' click actions. Two feature sets are extracted,
   indicating the number of clicks on 12 learning sites based on weekly and
   monthly time intervals. For both feature sets, the experiments are
   performed to compare deep learning algorithms (including LSTM and
   1D-CNN) with traditional machine learning approaches. It is found that
   the LSTM algorithm outperformed other approaches on a range of
   evaluation metrics, with up to 90.25\% accuracy. Four out of twelve
   learning sites (content, subpage, homepage, quiz) are identified as
   critical in influencing student performance in the course. The insights
   from these critical learning sites can inform the design of future
   courses and teaching interventions to support at-risk students.},

Abstract = {Student performance prediction (SPP) aims to evaluate the grade that a
   student will reach before enrolling in a course or taking an exam. This
   prediction problem is a kernel task toward personalized education and
   has attracted increasing attention in the field of artificial
   intelligence and educational data mining (EDM). This paper provides a
   systematic review of the SPP study from the perspective of machine
   learning and data mining. This review partitions SPP into five stages,
   i.e., data collection, problem formalization, model, prediction, and
   application. To have an intuition on these involved methods, we
   conducted experiments on a data set from our institute and a public data
   set. Our educational dataset composed of 1,325 students, and 832 courses
   was collected from the information system, which represents a typical
   higher education in China. With the experimental results, discussions on
   current shortcomings and interesting future works are finally summarized
   from data collections to practices. This work provides developments and
   challenges in the study task of SPP and facilitates the progress of
   personalized education.},

Abstract = {Predicting and understanding student learning performance has been a
   long-standing task in learning science, which can benefit personalized
   teaching and learning. This study shows that the progress towards this
   task can be accelerated by using learning record data to feed a deep
   learning model that considers the intrinsic course association and the
   structured features. We proposed a multi-source sparse attention
   convolutional neural network (MsaCNN) to predict the course grades in a
   general formulation. MsaCNN adopts multi-scale convolution kernels on
   student grade records to capture structured features, a global attention
   strategy to discover the relationship between courses, and multiple
   input-heads to integrate multi-source features. All achieved features
   are then poured into a softmax classifier towards an end-to-end
   supervised deep learning model. Conducting insights into higher
   education on real-world university datasets, the results show that
   MsaCNN achieves better performance than traditional methods and delivers
   an interpretation of student performance by virtue of the resulted
   course relationships. Inspired by this interpretation, we created an
   association map for all mentioned courses, followed by evaluating the
   map with a questionnaire survey. This study provides computer-aided
   system tools and discovers the course-space map from the educational
   data, potentially facilitating the personalized learning progress.},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Educational Data Mining plays a critical role in advancing the learning
   environment by contributing state-of-the-art methods, techniques, and
   applications. The recent development provides valuable tools for
   understanding the student learning environment by exploring and
   utilizing educational data using machine learning and data mining
   techniques. Modern academic institutions operate in a highly competitive
   and complex environment. Analyzing performance, providing high-quality
   education, strategies for evaluating the students' performance, and
   future actions are among the prevailing challenges universities face.
   Student intervention plans must be implemented in these universities to
   overcome problems experienced by the students during their studies. In
   this systematic review, the relevant EDM literature related to
   identifying student dropouts and students at risk from 2009 to 2021 is
   reviewed. The review results indicated that various Machine Learning
   (ML) techniques are used to understand and overcome the underlying
   challenges; predicting students at risk and students drop out
   prediction. Moreover, most studies use two types of datasets: data from
   student colleges/university databases and online learning platforms. ML
   methods were confirmed to play essential roles in predicting students at
   risk and dropout rates, thus improving the students' performance.},

Abstract = {Although the modern education system is highly developed, educators have
   never stopped looking for new ways to improve it. After entering the
   21st century, more and more educational data are stored, and data mining
   techniques have developed rapidly. Educational data mining has become a
   hot topic for educators who want to discover the information hiding
   among educational data. As a sub-branch of educational data mining,
   student performance prediction aims to predict student performance based
   on student datasets. This research attempts to improve the performance
   of predictive algorithms on a 5-level student performance grading
   system. This research changes the prediction method from a
   classification approach to a regression approach and enlarges small
   datasets with synthetic data. Algorithms including Support Vector
   Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Neural Network (NN), and Generative
   Adversarial Networks (GANs) are used in this research. From the results
   obtained, it is concluded that the regression approach outperforms the
   classification approach in predicting student performance. The
   classification approach is currently widely used in student performance
   prediction. This research also explores the possibility of using
   synthetic student data to augment small educational datasets. The course
   and evaluation system differ among different regions, making student
   data hard to collect or merge. Augmenting small student datasets with
   synthetic data may help educators to better evaluate their teaching
   skills. This research shows that a regression approach using synthetic
   data improves the prediction accuracy by up to 21.9\%, 15.6\%, and
   6.6\%, respectively, using SVM, NN, and RF.},

Title = {Study-GNN: A Novel Pipeline for Student Performance Prediction Based on
   Multi-Topology Graph Neural Networks},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {13},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Student performance prediction has attracted increasing attention in the
   field of educational data mining, or more broadly, intelligent education
   or ``AI + education{''}. Accurate performance prediction plays a
   significant role in solving the problem of a student dropping out,
   promoting personalized learning and improving teaching efficiency, etc.
   Traditional student performance prediction methods usually ignore the
   potential (underlying) relationship among students. In this paper, we
   use graph structure to reflect the students' relationships and propose a
   novel pipeline for student performance prediction based on
   newly-developed multi-topology graph neural networks (termed MTGNN). In
   particular, we propose various ways for graph construction based on
   similarity learning using different distance metrics. Based on the
   multiple graphs of different topologies, we design an MTGNN module, as a
   key module in the pipeline, to deal with the semi-supervised node
   classification problem where each node represents a student (and the
   node label is the student's performance, e.g., Pass/Fail/Withdrawal). An
   attention-based method is developed to produce the unified graph
   representation in MTGNN. The effectiveness of the proposed pipeline is
   verified in a case study, where a real-world educational dataset and
   several existing approaches are used for performance comparison. The
   experiment results show that, compared with some traditional machine
   learning methods and the vanilla graph convolutional network with only a
   single graph topology, our proposed pipeline works effectively and
   favorably in student performance prediction.},

Abstract = {Predicting student performance is a crucial research area in educational
   data mining. Student grades are influenced by various factors such as
   past academic performance, family background, and personal achievements.
   However, it is difficult to collect many relevant factors other than
   past academic performance, and it is not ideal to predict student
   performance using past academic records alone. Therefore, reducing the
   difficulty of data collection while maintaining timeliness and
   prediction accuracy remains a pressing issue. To address this challenge,
   this study proposes a novel model for predicting university student
   performance based on multi-feature fusion and attention mechanisms. The
   proposed model focuses on analyzing historical academic grades from
   multiple dimensions among university students to extract features that
   reveal relationships between courses and students, among different
   students themselves, or even between courses themselves. Additionally,
   an attention mechanism is introduced to explore the relationship between
   different dimensional features. This study collected a triplet set of
   related courses and students' real historical grades, proved the
   correlation between courses through data analysis, and verified the
   effectiveness of different dimensional features. Experimental results
   show that, compared with traditional machine learning methods, our
   proposed method achieves better prediction accuracy with a precision
   rate of 72.5\%.},

Abstract = {Improving the quality, developing and implementing systems that can
   provide advantages to students, and predicting students' success during
   the term, at the end of the term, or in the future are some of the
   primary aims of education. Due to its unique ability to create
   relationships and obtain accurate results, artificial intelligence and
   machine learning are tools used in this field to achieve the expected
   goals. However, the diversity of studies and the differences in their
   content create confusion and reduce their ability to pioneer future
   studies. In this study, we performed a systematic literature review of
   student performance prediction studies in three different databases
   between 2010 and 2020. The results are presented as percentages by
   categorizing them as either model, dataset, validation, evaluation, or
   aims. The common points and differences in the studies are determined,
   and critical gaps and possible remedies are presented. The results and
   identified gaps could be eliminated with standardized evaluation and
   validation strategies. It is determined that student performance
   prediction studies should be more frequently focused on deep learning
   models in the future. Finally, the problems that can be solved using a
   global dataset created by a global education information consortium, as
   well as its advantages, are presented.},

   distinguish the difference factor between the time dimension (duration
   of the course) and the feature dimension (students' learning activities)
   by attention weights to provide helpful information and improve
   predictions of student performance. In this study, we introduce
   Attention-Based Artificial Neural Network (Attn-ANN), a novel model in
   educational data mining. The Attn-ANN combines attention weighting on
   the time and feature dimensions to examine the significance of lectures
   and learning activities and makes predictions by visualizing attention
   weight. We found that the Attn-ANN had a better area under the curve
   scores than conventional algorithms, and the attention mechanism allowed
   models to focus on input selectively. Incorporating the attention
   weighting of both the time and feature dimensions improved the
   prediction performance in an ablation study. Finally, we investigated
   and analyzed the model's decision, finding that the Attn-ANN may be able
   to create synergy in real-world scenarios between the Attn-ANN's
   predictions and instructors' expertise, which underscores a novel
   contribution to engineering applications for interventions for at-risk
   students.},

Abstract = {In the field of educational data mining, accurately predicting student
   performance is vital for developing effective educational strategies.
   However, existing methods often fall short in capturing the complex
   relationships between students, focusing mainly on individual
   attributes. This paper introduces a pioneering framelet-based dual
   hypergraph neural network (FD-HGNN) model to advance this task. Our
   innovative approach decomposes student feature matrices into low-pass
   and high-pass components using a framelet-based transform. These
   components form the basis for creating hypergraphs, capturing intricate
   student relationships. The model integrates a dual hypergraph neural
   network with distinct channels for low-pass and high-pass components,
   augmented by a variance interaction layer employing an attention
   mechanism. This structure ensures a more comprehensive representation of
   student data, enhancing prediction accuracy. Extensive validation
   against traditional machine learning methods and graph neural networks
   across four real-world educational datasets demonstrates the superiority
   of our approach. The findings highlight the significant potential of our
   model in revolutionizing student performance prediction in educational
   settings.},

Title = {Predicting academic performance of students with machine learning},
Journal = {INFORMATION DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 NOV 14},
Abstract = {This study investigates the effectiveness of machine learning and deep
   learning models for early prediction of student performance in higher
   education institutions. Using the Open University Learning Analytics
   (OULA) dataset, various models, including Decision Tree, Support Vector
   Machine, Neural Network, and Ensemble Model, were employed to predict
   student performance in three categories: Pass/Fail, Close to Fail, and
   Close to Pass. The Ensemble Model (EM) consistently outperformed other
   models, achieving the highest overall F1 measure, precision, recall, and
   accuracy. These results highlight the potential of data-driven
   techniques in informing educational stakeholders' decision-making
   processes, enabling targeted interventions, and facilitating
   personalized learning strategies tailored to students' needs. By
   identifying at-risk students early in the academic year, institutions
   can provide additional support to improve academic outcomes and
   retention rates. The study also discusses practical implications,
   including the development of pedagogical policies and guidelines based
   on early predictions, which can help educational institutions maintain
   strong academic outcomes and enhance their reputation for academic
   excellence. Future research aims to investigate the impact of individual
   activities on student performance and explore day-to-day student
   behaviors, enabling the creation of tailored pedagogical policies and
   guidelines.},

Abstract = {This article introduces a novel method that integrates collaborative
   filtering into the naive Bayes model to enhance predicting student
   academic performance. The combined approach leverages collaborative user
   behavior analysis and probabilistic modeling, showing promising results
   in improved prediction precision. Collaborative Filtering explores user
   behavior patterns, while Naive Bayes employs Bayes' theorem for
   probabilistic data classification. Focused on predicting academic
   success, the integration incorporates collaborative patterns from
   student data for increased accuracy. The method considers similar
   students' performance and behavior for nuanced, personalized
   predictions. Starting with diverse data collection, including
   collaborative patterns among students, Collaborative Filtering
   identifies relationships and patterns among those with similar academic
   histories. These insights enrich the naive Bayes algorithm, creating a
   holistic approach for more accurate predictions, and contributing to
   ongoing machine learning initiatives in education.},

Abstract = {In recent times, Educational Data Mining and Learning Analytics have
   been abundantly used to model decision-making to improve
   teaching/learning ecosystems. However, the adaptation of student models
   in different domains/courses needs a balance between the generalization
   and context specificity to reduce the redundancy in creating
   domain-specific models. This paper explores the predictive power and
   generalization of a feature - context-bound cognitive skill score- in
   estimating the likelihood of success or failure of a student in a
   traditional higher education course so that the appropriate intervention
   is provided to help the students. To identify the students at risk in
   different courses, we applied classification algorithms on context-bound
   cognitive skill scores of a student to estimate the chances of success
   or failure, especially failure. The context-bound cognitive skill scores
   were aggregated based on the learning objective of a course to generate
   meaningful visual feedback to teachers and students so that they can
   understand why some students are predicted to be at risk. Evaluation of
   the generated model shows that this feature is applicable in a range of
   courses, and it mitigates the effort in engineering features/models for
   each domain. We submit that overall, context-bound cognitive skill
   scores prove to be effective in flagging the student performance when
   the accurate metrics related to learning activities and social behaviors
   of the students are unavailable.},

Abstract = {In this paper, we apply data mining techniques and machine learning
   algorithms using R software, which is used to predict, here we applied a
   regression model to test some factor on the dataset for which we assumed
   that it effects student performance. Model was built on an existing
   dataset which contains many factors and the final grades. The factors
   tested are the attention to higher education, absences, study time,
   parent's education level, parent's jobs, and the number of failures in
   the past. The result shows that only study time and absences can affect
   the students' performance. Prediction of student academic performance
   helps instructors develop a good understanding of how well or how poorly
   the students in their classes will perform, so instructors can take
   proactive measures to improve student learning. This paper also focuses
   on how the prediction algorithm can be used to identify the most
   important attributes in a student's data.},

Abstract = {Student performance modelling is one of the challenging and popular
   research topics in educational data mining (EDM). Multiple factors
   influence the performance in non-linear ways; thus making this field
   more attractive to the researchers. The widespread availability of e
   ducational datasets further catalyse this interestingness, especially in
   online learning. Although several EDM surveys are available in the
   literature, we could find only a few specific surveys on student
   performance analysis and prediction. These specific surveys are limited
   in nature and primarily focus on studies that try to identify possible
   predictor or model student performance. However, the previous works do
   not address the temporal aspect of prediction. Moreover, we could not
   find any such specific survey which focuses only on classroom-based
   education. In this paper, we present a systematic review of EDM studies
   on student performance in classroom learning. It focuses on identifying
   the predictors, methods used for such identification, time and aim of
   prediction. It is significantly the first systematic survey of EDM
   studies that consider only classroom learning and focuses on the
   temporal aspect as well. This paper presents a review of 140 studies in
   this area. The meta-analysis indicates that the researchers achieve
   significant prediction efficiency during the tenure of the course.
   However, performance prediction before course commencement needs special
   attention.},

Abstract = {Education is crucial for a productive life and providing necessary
   resources. With the advent of technology like artificial intelligence,
   higher education institutions are incorporating technology into
   traditional teaching methods. Predicting academic success has gained
   interest in education as a strong academic record improves a
   university's ranking and increases student employment opportunities.
   Modern learning institutions face challenges in analyzing performance,
   providing high-quality education, formulating strategies for evaluating
   students' performance, and identifying future needs. E-learning is a
   rapidly growing and advanced form of education, where students enroll in
   online courses. Platforms like Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS),
   learning management systems (LMS), and massive open online courses
   (MOOC) use educational data mining (EDM) to develop automatic grading
   systems, recommenders, and adaptative systems. However, e-learning is
   still considered a challenging learning environment due to the lack of
   direct interaction between students and course instructors. Machine
   learning (ML) is used in developing adaptive intelligent systems that
   can perform complex tasks beyond human abilities. Some areas of
   applications of ML algorithms include cluster analysis, pattern
   recognition, image processing, natural language processing, and medical
   diagnostics. In this research work, K-means, a clustering data mining
   technique using Davies' Bouldin method, obtains clusters to find
   important features affecting students' performance. The study found that
   the SVM algorithm had the best prediction results after parameter
   adjustment, with a 96\% accuracy rate. In this paper, the researchers
   have examined the functions of the Support Vector Machine, Decision
   Tree, naive Bayes, and KNN classifiers. The outcomes of parameter
   adjustment greatly increased the accuracy of the four prediction models.
   Na \& iuml;ve Bayes model's prediction accuracy is the lowest when
   compared to other prediction methods, as it assumes a strong independent
   relationship between features.},

Abstract = {Educational Data Mining has turned into an effective technique for
   revealing relationships hidden in educational data and predicting
   students' learning outcomes. One can analyze data extracted from the
   students' activity, educational and social behavior, and academic
   background. The outcomes which are produced are, the following: A
   personalized learning procedure, a feasible engagement with students'
   behavior, a predictable interaction of the students with the learning
   processes and data. In the current work, we apply several supervised
   methods aiming at predicting the students' academic performance. We
   prove that the use of the default parameters of learning algorithms on a
   voting generalization procedure of the three most accurate classifiers,
   can produce better results than any single tuned learning algorithm.},

Abstract = {Today, educational institutions produce large amounts of data with the
   deployment of learning management systems. These large datasets provide
   an untapped potential to support and enhance decision-making and
   operations. In recent times, machine learning (ML) has been applied to
   develop models utilizing this ``big{''} data to assist in
   decision-making. This study presents a systematic literature review into
   the application of ML to predict student performance. A total of 162
   research articles from January 2010 to October 2022 were critically
   reviewed and analyzed by applying Kitchenham's systematic literature
   review approach. Our analysis categorized the literature predicting
   students' academic performance into two categories: (i) predicting
   student performance in assessments, courses or programs, and identifying
   students at-risk of failing their course/program (129 studies); and (ii)
   predicting student dropout or retention in a course or program (33
   studies). Classification is the most commonly used approach for
   predicting student performance (138 studies), followed by regression (25
   studies) and clustering (9 studies). Supervised learning methods are
   used more often than semi-supervised learning. Five most popular ML
   algorithms include the Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes,
   Artificial Neural Network, and Support Vector Machine. Historical
   records of students' grades and class performance, academic related data
   from learning management systems, and students' demographics are the
   most common features used for predicting students' performance. The most
   common methods used for feature selection are Information Gain-based
   selection algorithms, Correlation-based feature selection, and Gain
   Ratio. The general platforms/tools/libraries used in the studies include
   WEKA, Python, R, Rapid Miner, and MATLAB. We also investigated possible
   actions considered in the literature to help at-risk students. We only
   found very few studies that deployed remedial actions and evaluated
   their impact on students' performance. In conclusion, ML has shown great
   potential in the prediction of student performance, but also has many
   areas of further research.},

Abstract = {This systematic literature review aims to identify the recent research
   trend, most studied factors, and methods used to predict student
   academic performance from 2015 to 2021. The PRISMA framework guides the
   study. The study reviews 58 out of 219 research articles from Lens and
   Scopus databases. The findings indicate that the research focus of
   current studies revolves around identifying factors influencing student
   performance, data mining (DM) algorithms performance, and DM related to
   e-Learning systems. It also reveals that student academic records and
   demographics are primary aspects that affect student performance. The
   most used DM approach is classification and the Decision Tree classifier
   is the most employed DM algorithm.},

Abstract = {One of the important measures of quality of education is the performance
   of students in academic settings. Nowadays, abundant data is stored in
   educational institutions about students which can help to discover
   insight on how students are learning and to improve their performance
   ahead of time using data mining techniques. In this paper, we developed
   a student performance prediction model that predicts the performance of
   high school students for the next semester for five courses. We modeled
   our prediction system as a multi-label classification task and used
   support vector machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), K-nearest Neighbors
   (KNN), and Multi-layer perceptron (MLP) as base-classifiers to train our
   model. We further improved the performance of the prediction model using
   a state-of-the-art partitioning scheme to divide the label space into
   smaller spaces and used Label Powerset (LP) transformation method to
   transform each labelset into a multi-class classification task. The
   proposed model achieved better performance in terms of different
   evaluation metrics when compared to other multi-label learning tasks
   such as binary relevance and classifier chains.},

   with Automated Construction},
Journal = {MATHEMATICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Number = {15},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Student performance prediction (SPP) is a pivotal task in educational
   analytics, enabling proactive interventions and optimized resource
   allocation by educators. Traditional SPP models are often hindered by
   their complexity and lack of interpretability. This study introduces a
   novel SPP framework, the Belief Rule Base with automated construction
   (Auto-BRB), designed to address these issues. Firstly, reference values
   are derived through data mining techniques. The model employs an IF-THEN
   rule-based system integrated with evidential reasoning to ensure both
   transparency and interpretability. Secondly, parameter optimization is
   achieved using the Projected Covariance Matrix Adaptive Evolution
   Strategy (P-CMA-ES), significantly enhancing model accuracy. Moreover,
   the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is then applied to fine-tune the
   balance between model accuracy and complexity. Finally, case studies on
   SPP have shown that the Auto-BRB model has an advantage over traditional
   models in terms of accuracy, while maintaining good interpretability.
   Therefore, Auto-BRB has excellent application effects in educational
   data analysis.},

Abstract = {The large volume of data and its complexity in educational institutions
   require the sakes from informative technologies. In order to facilitate
   this task, many researchers have focused on using machine learning to
   extract knowledge from the education database to support students and
   instructors in getting better performance. In prediction models, the
   challenging task is to choose the effective techniques which could
   produce satisfying predictive accuracy. Hence, in this work, we
   introduced a hybrid approach of principal component analysis (PCA) as
   conjunction with four machines learning (ML) algorithms: random forest
   (RF), C5.0 of decision tree (DT), and naive Bayes (NB) of Bayes network
   and support vector machine (SVM), to improve the performances of
   classification by solving the misclassification problem. Three datasets
   were used to confirm the robustness of the proposed models. Through the
   given datasets, we evaluated the classification accuracy and root mean
   square error (RSME) as evaluation metrics of the proposed models. In
   this classification problem, 10-fold cross-validation was proposed to
   evaluate the predictive performance. The proposed hybrid models produced
   very prediction results which shown itself as the optimal prediction and
   classification algorithms.},

   second dataset grade is in a three-level categorization (fail, good and
   excellent). The research applies all possible combinations of eleven
   features for the selection of best predicting features, so we examined a
   total of 24432 prediction models on both datasets. The results show that
   Logistic Regression obtained the best results on binary dataset and
   Random Forests obtained the best results on three-level grade
   categorization, in terms of accuracy, precision and recall. We showed
   how the same classifiers on different features can give very similar
   results. In other words, there is no single best prediction model that
   significantly outperforms the others, but there are several very similar
   models that differ in the number of features selected and the selected
   classifier.},

Abstract = {Prediction of Student performance through a machine predicts a student's
   future success. It can be considered an essential procedure to determine
   the students' academic excellence and identify them at high risk for
   academic performance. Prediction of student performance also provides
   universities with a high reputation and ranking. The evaluation of `What
   students can do with their learning' is still a tedious task. There are
   many challenging factors to solve this problem, mainly owing to the
   enormous amount of data collected from students. Most of the research
   works have focused on developing new methodologies for student
   performance prediction. But all the existing work has some performance
   limitations. Here, a new model called transient search capsule network
   based on the deep Autoencoder (TSCNDE) is introduced to detect student
   performance. The TSCNDE method is implemented with the help of the
   PYTHON tool. The performance prediction process has been completed with
   the help of the OULA dataset. The obtained results are assessed on
   accuracy (99.2\%), precision, (99.8\%), specificity (98.7\%), and
   sensitivity (98.9\%) parameters. The results obtained showed that the
   TSCNDE method is about 99.2\% more accurate than the other related
   method. Also, the obtained results are compared with some existing deep
   learning and machine learning methods.},

Abstract = {An admissions system based on valid and reliable admissions criteria is
   very important to select candidates likely to perform well academically
   at institutions of higher education. This study focuses on ways to
   support universities in admissions decision making using data mining
   techniques to predict applicants \& x2019; academic performance at
   university. A data set of 2,039 students enrolled in a Computer Science
   and Information College of a Saudi public university from 2016 to 2019
   was used to validate the proposed methodology. The results demonstrate
   that applicants \& x2019; early university performance can be predicted
   before admission based on certain pre-admission criteria (high school
   grade average, Scholastic Achievement Admission Test score, and General
   Aptitude Test score). The results also show that Scholastic Achievement
   Admission Test score is the pre-admission criterion that most accurately
   predicts future student performance. Therefore, this score should be
   assigned more weight in admissions systems. We also found that the
   Artificial Neural Network technique has an accuracy rate above 79 \&
   x0025;, making it superior to other classification techniques considered
   (Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, and Na \& x00EF;ve Bayes).},

Abstract = {In every educational institution, predicting pupils' performance is a
   vital responsibility. Due to this, a variety of data mining techniques,
   such as clustering, classification, and regression, are applied to
   anticipate the learner's study behavior. By Machine Learning's arrival,
   it has become vital to forecast students' academic achievement, and this
   study attracts significant attention within the scientific community. In
   addition, the findings from this work have tremendous socio-economic
   consequences. One area of major research in the world of education today
   is educational data mining, which is the study of techniques to reveal
   hidden patterns in educational data. Data mining strategies succeed or
   fail to depend on the type and quality of the data that is being minexl.
   Here, we provide a novel method that enhances the accuracy of prior
   student performance prediction by identifying and providing an
   explanation as to why it is rising. Using our robust machine learning
   ensemble models, we propose and evaluate a prediction model. The
   findings demonstrate that our CatBoost - an ensemble machine learning
   model - is superior to standard machine learning models with an accuracy
   of 92.27\%. This new model was able to show itself to be dependable by
   the use of smote and hyperparameter optimization, which proved to be
   valuable methods and approaches. Additional features are significant as
   well. More critically, a unique method is utilized to increase model
   transparency. The SHAD values are a valuable part of the student
   performance prediction system, which we think should be integrated. For
   those educators tasked with using prediction models in education, we
   have found that there is a preference for models that offer both
   insightful insights and easy to understand predictions, as by utilizing
   our experiment the educator will be able to identify those students who
   are at early risk and inspire and encourage those students in a positive
   way.},

   regression models based on a sample of 18.908 candidates. Such models
   considered the scores of the tests of (i) Languages, Codes and their
   Technologies, (ii) Mathematics and their Technologies, (iii) Natural
   Sciences and their Technologies and (iv) Human Sciences and their
   Technologies and (v) Writing; and personal data (iv) age, (v) sex and
   (vi) completed high school in a public or private school. Six models
   showed independence, cons-tant variance, absence of influential and
   significant outliers, allowing for an excellent predictive capacity of

Abstract = {Increasing productivity in educational systems is of great imprtance.
   Researchers are keen to predict the academic performance of students;
   this is done to enhance the overall productivity of educational system
   by effectively identifying students whose performance is below average.
   This universal concern has been combined with data science leading to
   the creation of an interdisciplinary research area called Educational
   Data Mining. One of the recent issues which has been addressed by
   researchers is training generalizable models from different aspects such
   as gender, major, geography and etc. Therefore, in this research we use
   machine learning methods to predict student's performance, emphasizing
   on training generalizable models from geographical aspect. For this
   purpose, a questionnaire containing 37 questions was designed, through
   which 536 answers were collected, including 111 international and 425
   domestic answers. According to the literature, student performance is
   mostly determined based on the GPA (grade point average) of the entire
   course. In this research, information about the GPA of respondents in
   undergraduate and graduate courses was collected in the form of three
   classes. After a final review of the models employed in previous
   studies, the main models selected and used for classification purposes
   included SVM, CNN, Adaboost, RF, SVM, and DT. Feature selection is
   performed using XGBoost, random forest, as well as SVML1. The main issue
   investigated in this study is the generalizability of the models trained
   on domestic (iranian) data and tested on international data
   (non-iranian). Experimental results show that the best models trained
   with specific dataset collected in this research had generalizability
   comparing to base models' outcomes which were trained and tested on
   domestic data. Meanwhile, Random forest and CNN models shows the best
   performance with the average of accuracy and F-score of 73.5 and 68.5,
   respectively.},

Abstract = {The main aim of an educational institute is to offer high-quality
   education to students. The system to achieve better quality in the
   educational system is to find the knowledge from educational data and to
   discover the attributes that manipulate the performance of students.
   Student performance prediction is a major issue in education and
   training, specifically in the educational data mining system. This
   research presents the student performance prediction approach with the
   MapReduce framework based on the proposed fractional competitive
   multi-verse optimization-based deep neuro-fuzzy network. The proposed
   fractional competitive multi-verse optimization-based deep neuro-fuzzy
   network is derived by integrating fractional calculus with competitive
   multi-verse optimization. The MapReduce framework is designed with the
   mapper and the reducer phase to perform the student performance
   prediction mechanism with the deep learning classifier. The input data
   is partitioned at the mapper phase to perform the data transformation
   process, and thereby the features are selected using the distance
   measure. The selected unique features are employed for the data
   segmentation process, and thereafter the prediction strategy is
   accomplished at the reducer phase by the deep neuro-fuzzy network
   classifier. The proposed method obtained the performance in terms of
   mean square error, root mean square error and mean absolute error with
   the values of 0.338 3, 0.581 7, and 0.391 5, respectively.},

Abstract = {Educational Data Mining (EDM) is gaining great importance as a new
   interdisciplinary research field related to some other areas. It is
   directly related to data mining (DM), the latter being a fundamental
   part of knowledge discovery in databases (KDD). This data is growing
   more and more and contains hidden knowledge that could be very useful
   for users (both teachers and students). It is convenient to identify
   such knowledge in the form of models, patterns, or any other
   representation scheme that allows better exploitation of the system.
   Data mining is revealed as the tool to achieve such discovery, giving
   rise to EDM. In this complex context, different techniques and learning
   algorithms are usually used to obtain the best results. Recently
   educational systems are adopting artificial intelligent systems,
   especially in the educational context, specific areas for extracting
   relevant information, such as EDM, which integrates numerous techniques
   that support the capture, processing, and analysis of these sets of
   records. The main technique associated with EDM is Machine Learning,
   which has been used for decades in data processing in different
   contexts, but with the advent of Big Data, there was an intensification
   in the application of this technique to extract relevant information
   from a huge amount of data. This paper proposes the student performance
   prediction using CNN (Convolution Neural Network) and BPSO (Binary
   Particle Swarm Optimization) based feature selection method. In this
   study, classifiers are made for 2-class and 5-class predictions. The
   proposed system claims an outperforming accuracy of 96.6\% with various
   previous research works as well as found that the majority of attributes
   related to school activities as compared to data on demographic and
   socioeconomic characteristics. (c) 2022 The Authors. Published by IASE.

Title = {Multi-task MIML learning for pre-course student performance prediction},
Journal = {FRONTIERS OF COMPUTER SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {14},
Number = {5},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In higher education, the initial studying period of each course plays a
   crucial role for students, and seriously influences the subsequent
   learning activities. However, given the large size of a course's
   students at universities, it has become impossible for teachers to keep
   track of the performance of individual students. In this circumstance,
   an academic early warning system is desirable, which automatically
   detects students with difficulties in learning (i.e., at-risk students)
   prior to a course starting. However, previous studies are not well
   suited to this purpose for two reasons: 1) they have mainly concentrated
   on e-learning platforms, e.g., massive open online courses (MOOCs), and
   relied on the data about students' online activities, which is hardly
   accessed in traditional teaching scenarios; and 2) they have only made
   performance prediction when a course is in progress or even close to the
   end. In this paper, for traditional classroom-teaching scenarios, we
   investigate the task of pre-course student performance prediction, which
   refers to detecting at-risk students for each course before its
   commencement. To better represent a student sample and utilize the
   correlations among courses, we cast the problem as a multi-instance
   multi-label (MIML) problem. Besides, given the problem of data scarcity,
   we propose a novel multi-task learning method, i.e., MIML-Circle, to
   predict the performance of students from different specialties in a
   unified framework. Extensive experiments are conducted on five
   real-world datasets, and the results demonstrate the superiority of our
   approach over the state-of-the-art methods.},

Abstract = {The primary goal of educational systems is to enrich the quality of
   education by maximizing the best results and minimizing the failure rate
   of poor-performing students. Early predicting student performance has
   become a challenging task for the improvement and development of
   academic performance. Educational data mining is an effective discipline
   of data mining concerned with information integrated into the education
   domain. The study is of this work is to propose techniques in
   educational data mining and integrate it into a web-based system for
   predicting poor-performing students. A comparative study of prediction
   models was conducted. Subsequently, high performing models were
   developed to get higher performance. The hybrid random forest named
   Hybrid RF produces the most successful classification. For the context
   of intervention and improving the learning outcomes, a novel feature
   selection method named MICHI, which is the combination of mutual
   information and chi-square algorithms based on the ranked feature scores
   is introduced to select a dominant set and improve performance of
   prediction models. By using the proposed techniques of educational data
   mining, and academic performance prediction system is subsequently
   developed for educational stockholders to get an early prediction of
   student learning outcomes for timely intervention. Experimental results
   and evaluation surveys report the effectiveness and usefulness of the
   developed academic prediction system. The system is used to help
   educational stakeholders for intervening and improving student
   performance.},

Title = {Discriminable Multi-Label Attribute Selection for Pre-Course Student
   Performance Prediction},
Journal = {ENTROPY},

Abstract = {The university curriculum is a systematic and organic study complex with
   some immediate associated steps; the initial learning of each semester's
   course is crucial, and significantly impacts the learning process of
   subsequent courses and further studies. However, the low teacher-student
   ratio makes it difficult for teachers to consistently follow up on the
   detail-oriented learning situation of individual students. The extant
   learning early warning system is committed to automatically detecting
   whether students have potential difficulties-or even the risk of
   failing, or non-pass reports-before starting the course. Previous
   related research has the following three problems: first of all, it
   mainly focused on e-learning platforms and relied on online activity
   data, which was not suitable for traditional teaching scenarios;
   secondly, most current methods can only proffer predictions when the
   course is in progress, or even approaching the end; thirdly, few studies
   have focused on the feature redundancy in these learning data. Aiming at
   the traditional classroom teaching scenario, this paper transforms the
   pre-class student performance prediction problem into a multi-label
   learning model, and uses the attribute reduction method to
   scientifically streamline the characteristic information of the courses
   taken and explore the important relationship between the characteristics
   of the previously learned courses and the attributes of the courses to
   be taken, in order to detect high-risk students in each course before
   the course begins. Extensive experiments were conducted on 10 real-world
   datasets, and the results proved that the proposed approach achieves
   better performance than most other advanced methods in multi-label
   classification evaluation metrics.</p>},

Abstract = {Planning course study is critical to facilitate strategic intervention
   in education. As a significant basis of planning course study, student
   performance prediction aims to utilize students existing relevant
   information to predict their future learning performance including
   course grades, course failure, grade point average, etc. We target
   course grade prediction for course study planning, provide reminders for
   students' learning and teachers' teaching. A student's performance is
   usually influenced by a variety of factors, such as the difficulty of
   the test, personal performance, and learning conditions. Recent studies
   focus on the various factors that influence student performance.
   However, most of them ignore the differences in the impact of these
   factors on different students. Moreover, existing prediction models pay
   less attention to the impact of test complexity on students'
   performance. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel
   Complexity-based Attentive Interactive Student Performance prediction
   model (CAISP) for personalized course study planning. In CAISP, the
   individual differences among students can be considered by assigning
   dynamically different importance using attention network to facilitate
   personalized planning. Especially, to effectively alleviate the student
   performance bias caused by test complexity, we fuse test complexity
   features to enhance the ability of feature representation via deep
   neural networks. Meanwhile, we combine factorization machines to develop
   a deep joint representation based on interaction learning and further
   boost the correlation between features, leading to optimal prediction
   results. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets show that
   CAISP outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions.},

Title = {Unlocking the Potential of Competency Exam Data with Machine Learning:
   Improving Higher Education Evaluation},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},

Abstract = {In Jordanian higher education institutions, a competency exam was
   developed to ensure that students had the ability to attain particular
   competence levels. The results of the competency examination are one of
   the measures used as key performance indicators (KPIs) evaluating the
   quality of academic programs and universities. There are numerous
   evaluation methods for students' performances based on the academic
   achievement of the pupils, including the application of conventional
   statistical approaches and machine learning. The objective of this paper
   is to develop a framework to help decision-makers and universities
   evaluate academic programs using ML by identifying programs and learning
   outcomes that need to be established by analyzing competency exam data.
   The developed framework can also reduce exam costs by substituting
   machine learning algorithms for the actual execution of the exam. We
   have created a dataset that can assist academics with their study; the
   dataset includes demographic and academic data about students, such as
   their gender, average university degree, type of university, and
   outcomes on the competency exam based on their level and competencies.
   Experiments supported the claim that models trained using samples from
   the student sub-dataset outperform models constructed using samples from
   the entire dataset. In addition, the experiments demonstrated that ML
   algorithms are an effective tool for recognizing patterns in student
   performance. Experiments demonstrated that no single ML model
   outperforms other ML models. However, the MLP model generates more
   accurate models, making them more beneficial for developing robust
   frameworks.},

Abstract = {To understand students' learning behaviors, this study uses machine
   learning technologies to analyze the data of interactive learning
   environments, and then predicts students' learning outcomes. This study
   adopted a variety of machine learning classification methods, quizzes,
   and programming system logs, found that students' learning
   characteristics were correlated with their learning performance when
   they encountered similar programming practice. In this study, we used
   random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression
   (LR), and neural network (NN) algorithms to predict whether students
   would submit on time for the course. Among them, the NN algorithm showed
   the best prediction results. Education-related data can be predicted by
   machine learning techniques, and different machine learning models with
   different hyperparameters can be used to obtain better results.},

Journal = {EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES},

Abstract = {Developing tools to support students, educators, intuitions, and
   government in the educational environment has become an important task
   to improve the quality of education and learning outcomes. Information
   and communication technology (ICT) is adopted by educational
   institutions; one such instance is video interaction in flipped
   teaching. ICT-based learning generates a huge amount of data that can be
   utilized to better understand student behavior and improve students
   learning. Predicting students' academic performance is essential to take
   proactive measures to improve student learning and reduce the risk of
   student dropout and failure. This study aims to use video learning
   analysis and data mining approaches to predict student academic
   achievement and identify the factors affecting their performance. For
   this purpose, the dataset containing records of 326 students from a
   higher education institution (HEI) is used which contains records from
   SIS, Moodle, and eDify. This study advocates the use of a balanced
   dataset and optimized feature set to obtain better performance for
   students' academic performance prediction. Several machine learning and
   deep learning models are applied to analyze their performance against
   the original dataset, balanced dataset, and balanced dataset with the
   optimized feature set. Experimental results demonstrate decision tree
   classifier outperforms with an accuracy of 99.06\% with a balanced
   dataset and optimized feature set. Further analysis indicates that the
   video interaction feature has a strong impact on the performance of
   students.},

Abstract = {For scholarly organizations, students' academic performance (AP)
   computes student achievements in different academic subjects. Therefore,
   a systematic literature review based on machine learning approaches to
   improve student performance is proposed. This field creates a way to
   discover hidden examples from instructive information. Machine learning
   (ML) techniques are used for performance prediction. It is become a
   challenge due to its imbalanced dataset. This review aims to identify
   the best proposals that focus on various ML methods used for the
   performance analysis of students. This review will become helpful to the
   teachers in identifying the weak students, and it helps to improve their
   performance through proper guidance. Thus, it reflects in the student's
   background and boosts their growth. It also brings benefits to students,
   teachers, and institutions. This study focused on applying machine
   learning techniques to predict students' performance in recent times.
   With a systematic approach, the research identified the existing
   prediction methods and tools used to predict students' performance and
   observed the researchers' type of variables in this research area. In
   this study, almost more than 100 papers were analyzed to reveal various
   modern techniques that are commonly used to predict student performance
   and the goals they need to achieve in this field. The results from the
   various research will help improve students' academics and monitor the
   student's performance, which would also improve their literacy rate.},

Title = {Systematic ensemble model selection approach for educational data mining},
Journal = {KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS},

Month = {JUL 20},
Abstract = {A plethora of research has been done in the past focusing on predicting
   student's performance in order to support their development. Many
   institutions are focused on improving the performance and the education
   quality; and this can be achieved by utilizing data mining techniques to
   analyze and predict students' performance and to determine possible
   factors that may affect their final marks. To address this issue, this
   work starts by thoroughly exploring and analyzing two different datasets
   at two separate stages of course delivery (20\% and 50\% respectively)
   using multiple graphical, statistical, and quantitative techniques. The
   feature analysis provides insights into the nature of the different
   features considered and helps in the choice of the machine learning
   algorithms and their parameters. Furthermore, this work proposes a
   systematic approach based on Gini index and p-value to select a suitable
   ensemble learner from a combination of six potential machine learning
   algorithms. Experimental results show that the proposed ensemble models
   achieve high accuracy and low false positive rate at all stages for both
   datasets. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Abstract = {In higher education, student learning relies increasingly on autonomy.
   With the rise in blended learning, both online and offline, students
   need to further improve their online learning effectiveness. Therefore,
   predicting students' performance and identifying students who are
   struggling in real time to intervene is an important way to improve
   learning outcomes. However, currently, machine learning in grade
   prediction applications typically only employs a single-output
   prediction method and has lagging issues. To advance the prediction of
   time and enhance the predictive attributes, as well as address the
   aforementioned issues, this study proposes a multi-output hybrid
   ensemble model that utilizes data from the Superstar Learning
   Communication Platform (SLCP) to predict grades. Experimental results
   show that using the first six weeks of SLCP data and the Xgboost model
   to predict mid-term and final grades meant that accuracy reached
   78.37\%, which was 3-8\% higher than the comparison models. Using the
   Gdbt model to predict homework and experiment grades, the average mean
   squared error was 16.76, which is better than the comparison models.
   This study uses a multi-output hybrid ensemble model to predict how
   grades can help improve student learning quality and teacher teaching
   effectiveness.},

Title = {Student Performance Prediction with Short-Term Sequential Campus
   Behaviors},
Journal = {INFORMATION},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {11},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {As students' behaviors are important factors that can reflect their
   learning styles and living habits on campus, extracting useful features
   of them plays a helpful role in understanding the students' learning
   process, which is an important step towards personalized education.
   Recently, the task of predicting students' performance from their campus
   behaviors has aroused the researchers' attention. However, existing
   studies mainly focus on extracting statistical features manually from
   the pre-stored data, resulting in hysteresis in predicting students'
   achievement and finding out their problems. Furthermore, due to the
   limited representation capability of these manually extracted features,
   they can only understand the students' behaviors shallowly. To make the
   prediction process timely and automatically, we treat the performance
   prediction task as a short-term sequence prediction problem, and propose
   a two-stage classification framework, i.e., Sequence-based Performance
   Classifier (SPC), which consists of a sequence encoder and a classic
   data mining classifier. More specifically, to deeply discover the
   sequential features from students' campus behaviors, we first introduce
   an attention-based Hybrid Recurrent Neural Network (HRNN) to encode
   their recent behaviors by giving a higher weight to the ones that are
   related to the students' last action. Then, to conduct student
   performance prediction, we further involve these learned features to the
   classic Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm and finally achieve our
   SPC model. We conduct extensive experiments in the real-world student
   card dataset. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of
   our proposed method in terms of Accuracy and Recall.},

Abstract = {Performance Factors Analysis (PFA) is considered one of the most
   important Knowledge Tracing (KT) approaches used for constructing
   adaptive educational hypermedia systems. It has shown a high prediction
   accuracy against many other KT approaches. While, the desire to estimate
   more accurately the student level leads researchers to enhance PFA by
   inventing several advanced extensions. However, most of the proposed
   extensions have exclusively been improved in a pedagogical sense, as the
   improvements have mostly been limited to the analysis of students'
   behaviour during their learning process. In contrast, Machine Learning
   provides many powerful methods that could be efficient to enhance, in
   the technical sense, the prediction of student performance. Our goal is
   to focus on the exploitation of Ensemble Learning methods as an
   extremely effective Machine Learning paradigm used to create many
   advanced solutions in several fields. In this sense, we propose a new
   PFA approach based on different models (Random Forest, AdaBoost, and
   XGBoost) in order to increase the predictive accuracy of student
   performance. Our models have been evaluated on three different datasets.
   The experimental results show that the scalable XGBoost has outperformed
   the other evaluated models and substantially improved the performance
   prediction compared to the original PFA algorithm.},

Abstract = {Student performance prediction is one of the most concerning issues in
   the field of education and training, especially educational data mining.
   The prediction supports students to select courses and design
   appropriate study plans for themselves. Moreover, student performance
   prediction enables lecturers as well as educational managers to indicate
   what students should be monitored and supported to complete their
   programs with the best results. These supports can reduce formal
   warnings and expulsions from universities due to students' poor
   performance. This study proposes a method to predict student performance
   using various deep learning techniques. Also, we analyze and present
   several techniques for data pre-processing (e.g., Quantile Transforms
   and MinMax Scaler) before fetching them into well-known deep learning
   models such as Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural
   Networks (CNN) to do prediction tasks. Experiments are built on 16
   datasets related to numerous different majors with appropriately four
   million samples collected from the student information system of a
   Vietnamese multidisciplinary university. Results show that the proposed
   method provides good prediction results, especially when using data
   transformation. The results are feasible for applying to practical
   cases.},

Abstract = {The new students struggle to understand the introductory programming
   courses, due to its intricate nature, which results in higher dropout
   and increased failure rates. Despite implementing productive
   methodologies, the instructor struggles to identify the students with
   distinctive levels of skills. The modern institutes are looking for
   technology-equipped practices to classify the students and prepare
   personalized consultation procedures for each class. This paper applies
   decision tree-based machine learning classifiers to develop a prediction
   model competent to forecast the outcome of the introductory programming
   students at an early stage of the semester. The model is then
   transformed into an adaptive consultation framework which generates
   three types of colored signals; red, yellow, and green which illustrates
   whether the student is performing low, average, or high respectively.
   This provides an opportunity for the instructor to set precautionary
   measures for low performing students and set complicated tasks that help
   the highly skilled students to improve their skills further. The
   experiments compare a set of decision tree-based classifiers and
   conclude J48 as an efficient model in classifying students in all
   classes with high accuracy, sensitivity, and F-measure. Even though the
   aim of the research is to focus on introductory programming courses,
   however, the framework is flexible and can be implemented in other
   courses.},

Abstract = {Student performance prediction has become a hot research topic. Most of
   the existing prediction models are built by a machine learning method.
   They are interested in prediction accuracy but pay less attention to
   interpretability. We propose a stacking ensemble model to predict and
   analyze student performance in academic competition. In this model,
   student performance is classified into two symmetrical categorical
   classes. To improve accuracy, three machine learning algorithms,
   including support vector machine (SVM), random forest, and AdaBoost are
   established in the first level and then integrated by logistic
   regression via stacking. A feature importance analysis was applied to
   identify important variables. The experimental data were collected from
   four academic years in Hankou University. According to comparative
   studies on five evaluation metrics (precision, recall, F1, error, and
   area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) in this
   analysis, the proposed model generally performs better than compared
   models. The important variables identified from the analysis are
   interpretable, they can be used as guidance to select potential
   students.},

Abstract = {Higher educational institutes generate massive amounts of student data.
   This data needs to be explored in depth to better understand various
   facets of student learning behavior. The educational data mining
   approach has given provisions to extract useful and non-trivial
   knowledge from large collections of student data. Using the educational
   data mining method of classification, this research analyzes data of 291
   university students in an attempt to predict student performance at the
   end of a 4-year degree program. A student segmentation framework has
   also been proposed to identify students at various levels of academic
   performance. Coupled with the prediction model, the proposed
   segmentation framework provides a useful mechanism for devising
   pedagogical policies to increase the quality of education by mitigating
   academic failure and encouraging higher performance. The experimental
   results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and the
   applicability of classifying students into multiple performance levels
   using a small subset of courses being taught in the initial two years of
   the 4-year degree program.},

Abstract = {Student performance prediction plays an important role in improving
   education quality. Noticing that students' exercise-answering processes
   exhibit different characteristics according to their different
   performance levels, this paper aims to mine the performance-related
   information from students' exercising logs and to explore the
   possibility of predicting students' performance using such
   process-characteristic information. A formal model of student-shared
   exercising processes and its discovery method from students' exercising
   logs are presented. Several similarity measures between students'
   individual exercising behavior and student-shared exercising processes
   are presented. A prediction method of students' performance level
   considering these similarity measures is explored based on
   classification algorithms. An experiment on real-life exercise-answering
   event logs shows the effectiveness of the proposed prediction method.},

Abstract = {Data mining approaches have been widely used to estimate student
   performance in online education. Various Machine Learning (ML) based
   data mining techniques have been developed to evaluate student
   performance accurately. However, they face specific issues in
   implementation. Hence, a novel hybrid Elman Neural with Apriori Mining
   (ENAM) approach was presented in this article to predict student
   performance in online education. The designed model was validated with
   the student's performance dataset. Incorporating the Elman neural system
   eliminates the noise data present in the dataset. Moreover, meaningful
   features are extracted in feature analysis and trained in the system.
   Then, the student's performances are sorted based on their average score
   and classified as good, bad, or average. In addition, a case study was
   developed to describe the working of the designed model. The presented
   approach was executed in python software, and performance metrics were
   estimated. Moreover, a comparative analysis was performed to prove that
   the proposed system earned better outcomes than existing approaches.},

Abstract = {-Modern universities must strategically analyze and manage student
   performance, utilizing knowledge discovery and data mining to extract
   valuable insights and enhance efficiency. Educational Data Mining (EDM)
   is a theory -oriented approach in academic settings that integrates
   computational methods to improve academic performance and faculty
   management. Machine learning algorithms are essential for knowledge
   discovery, enabling accurate performance prediction and early student
   identification, with classification being a widely applied method in
   predicting student performance based on various traits. Utilizing the
   Naive Bayes classifier (NBC) model, this research predicts student
   performance by harnessing the robust capabilities inherent in this
   classification tool. To bolster both efficiency and accuracy, the model
   integrates two optimization algorithms, namely Jellyfish Search
   Optimizer (JSO) and Artificial Rabbits Optimization (ARO). This
   underscores the research's commitment to employing cutting -edge machine
   learning and algorithms inspired by nature to achieve heightened
   precision in predicting student performance through the refinement of
   decision -making and prediction quality. To classify and predict G1 and
   G3 grades and evaluate students' performance in this study, a
   comprehensive analysis of the information pertaining to 395 students has
   been conducted. The results indicate that in predicting G1, the NBAR
   model, with an F1\_Score of 0.882, performed almost 1.03\% better than
   the NBJS model, which had an F1\_Score of 0.873. In G3 prediction, the
   NBAR model outperformed the NBJS model with F1\_Score values of 0.893
   and 0.884, respectively.},

Abstract = {Numerous educational institutions utilize data mining techniques to
   manage student records, particularly those related to academic
   achievements, which are essential in improving learning experiences and
   overall outcomes. Educational data mining (EDM) is a thriving research
   field that employs data mining and machine learning methods to extract
   valuable insights from educational databases, primarily focused on
   predicting students' academic performance. This study proposes a novel
   federated learning (FL) standard that ensures the confidentiality of the
   dataset and allows for the prediction of student grades, categorized
   into four levels: low, good, average, and drop. Optimized features are
   incorporated into the training process to enhance model precision. This
   study evaluates the optimized dataset using five machine learning (ML)
   algorithms, namely support vector machine (SVM), decision tree, Naive
   Bayes, K-nearest neighbors, and the proposed federated learning model.
   The models' performance is assessed regarding accuracy, precision,
   recall, and F1-score, followed by a comprehensive comparative analysis.
   The results reveal that FL and SVM outperform the alternative models,
   demonstrating superior predictive performance for student grade
   classification. This study showcases the potential of federated learning
   in effectively utilizing educational data from various institutes while
   maintaining data privacy, contributing to educational data mining and
   machine learning advancements for student performance prediction.},

Abstract = {Educational data mining is an emerging interdisciplinary research area
   involving both education and informatics. It has become an imperative
   research area due to many advantages that educational institutions can
   achieve. Along these lines, various data mining techniques have been
   used to improve learning outcomes by exploring large-scale data that
   come from educational settings. One of the main problems is predicting
   the future achievements of students before taking final exams, so we can
   proactively help students achieve better performance and prevent
   dropouts. Therefore, many efforts have been made to solve the problem of
   student performance prediction in the context of educational data
   mining. In this paper, we provide readers with a comprehensive
   understanding of student performance prediction and compare
   approximately 260 studies in the last 20 years with respect to i) major
   factors highly affecting student performance prediction, ii) kinds of
   data mining techniques including prediction and feature selection
   algorithms, and iii) frequently used data mining tools. The findings of
   the comprehensive analysis show that ANN and Random Forest are mostly
   used data mining algorithms, while WEKA is found as a trending tool for
   students' performance prediction. Students' academic records and
   demographic factors are the best attributes to predict performance. The
   study proves that irrelevant features in the dataset reduce the
   prediction results and increase model processing time. Therefore, almost
   half of the studies used feature selection techniques before building
   prediction models. This study attempts to provide useful and valuable
   information to researchers interested in advancing educational data
   mining. The study directs future researchers to achieve highly accurate
   prediction results in different scenarios using different available
   inputs or techniques. The study also helps institutions apply data
   mining techniques to predict and improve student outcomes by providing
   additional assistance on time.},

Abstract = {This paper illustrates how to use data mining techniques to help in
   advising students and predicting their academic performance. Data mining
   is used to get previously unknown, hidden and perhaps vital knowledge
   from a large amount of data. It combines domain knowledge, advanced
   analytical skills, and a vast knowledge base to reveal hidden patterns
   and trends that are applicable in virtually any sector ranging from
   engineering to medicine, to business. However, it is possible for
   educational institutes to use data mining to find useful information
   from their databases. This is usually called Educational Data Mining
   (EDM). Advancing the field of EDM with new data analysis techniques and
   new machine learning algorithms is vital. Classification and clustering
   techniques will be used in this project to study and analyse student
   performance. The key importance of this project is that it discusses
   different data mining techniques in the literature review to study
   student behaviour depending upon their performance. We tried to identify
   the most suitable algorithms from the existing research methods to
   predict the success of students. Various data mining approaches were
   discussed and their results were evaluated. In this paper, the J48
   algorithm was applied to the data set, gathered from Umm Al-Qura
   University in Makkah.},

Abstract = {Predicting academic performance is a key element in education, allowing
   teachers to design preventive didactic actions. Various computational
   disciplines are involved in this predictive process, with learning
   analytics, machine learning, educational data mining, artificial neural
   networks, and fuzzy theories being the most frequently used. A
   systematic review of the scientific literature (2010-March 2020) indexed
   in Scopus, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library and Springer is presented,
   with the aim of evaluating how academic performance prediction has
   behaved in two scenarios: (1) studies online (online) and blended; and
   (2) technological support for the face-to-face modality. The article
   concludes with the determination of the trends between the disciplines
   of educational technologies and the variables of academic performance.},

Abstract = {Predicting student performance for educational organizations such as
   universities, community colleges, schools, and training centers will
   enhance the overall results of these organizations. Big data can be
   extracted from the internal systems of these organizations, such as exam
   records, statistics about virtual courses, and e-learning systems.
   Finding meaningful knowledge from extracted data is a challenging task.
   In this paper, we proposed a modified version of Harris Hawks
   Optimization (HHO) algorithm by controlling the population diversity to
   overcome the early convergence problem and prevent trapping in a local
   optimum. The proposed approach is employed as a feature selection
   algorithm to discover the most valuable features for student performance
   prediction problem. A dynamic controller that controls the population
   diversity by observing the performance of HHO using the k-nearest
   neighbors (kNN) algorithm as a clustering approach. Once all solutions
   belong to one cluster, an injection process is employed to redistribute
   the solutions over the search space. A set of machine learning
   classifiers such as kNN, Layered recurrent neural network (LRNN), Naive
   Bayes, and Artificial Neural Network are used to evaluate the overall
   prediction system. A real dataset obtained from UCI machine learning
   repository is adopted in this paper. The obtained results show the
   importance of predicting students' performance at an earlier stage to
   avoid students' failure and improve the overall performance of the
   educational organization. Moreover, the reported results show that the
   combination between the enhanced HHO and LRNN can outperform other
   classifiers with accuracy equal to

Title = {On the Use of Soft Computing Methods in Educational Data Mining and
   Learning Analytics Research: a Review of Years 2010-2018},

Abstract = {The aim of this paper is to survey recent research publications that use
   Soft Computing methods to answer education-related problems based on the
   analysis of educational data `mined' mainly from interactive/e-learning
   systems. Such systems are known to generate and store large volumes of
   data that can be exploited to assess the learner, the system and the
   quality of the interaction between them. Educational Data Mining (EDM)
   and Learning Analytics (LA) are two distinct and yet closely related
   research areas that focus on this data aiming to address open
   education-related questions or issues. Besides `classic' data analysis
   methods such as clustering, classification, identification or
   regression/analysis of variances,soft computingmethods are often
   employed by EDM and LA researchers to achieve their various tasks. Their
   very nature as iterative optimization algorithms that avoid the
   exhaustive search of the solutions space and go for possibly suboptimal
   solutions yet at realistic time and effort, along with their heavy
   reliance on rich data sets for training, make soft computing methods
   ideal tools for the EDM or LA type of problems. Decision trees, random
   forests, artificial neural networks, fuzzy logic, support vector
   machines and genetic/evolutionary algorithms are a few examples of soft
   computing approaches that, given enough data, can successfully deal with
   uncertainty, qualitatively stated problems and incomplete, imprecise or
   even contradictory data sets - features that the field of education
   shares with all humanities/social sciences fields. The present review
   focuses, therefore, on recent EDM and LA research that employs at least
   one soft computing method, and aims to identify (i) the majoreducation
   problems/issuesaddressed and, consequently,research goals/objectivesset,
   (ii) thelearning contexts/settingswithin which relevant research and
   educational interventions take place, (iii) the relation betweenclassic
   and soft computing methodsemployed to solve specific problems/issues,
   and (iv) the means of dissemination (publication journals)of the
   relevant research results. Selection and analysis of a body of 300
   journal publications reveals that top research questions in education
   today seeking answers through soft computing methods refer directly to
   the issue ofquality- a critical issue given the currently dominant
   educational/pedagogical models that favor e-learning or computer- or
   technology-mediated learning contexts. Moreover, results identify the
   most frequently used methods and tools within EDM/LA research and,
   comparatively, within their soft computing subsets, along with the major
   journals relevant research is being published worldwide. Weaknesses and
   issues that need further attention in order to fully exploit the
   benefits of research results to improve both the learning experience and
   the learning outcomes are discussed in the conclusions.},

Title = {Predicting Student Dropout and Academic Success},
Journal = {DATA},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {7},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Higher education institutions record a significant amount of data about
   their students, representing a considerable potential to generate
   information, knowledge, and monitoring. Both school dropout and
   educational failure in higher education are an obstacle to economic
   growth, employment, competitiveness, and productivity, directly
   impacting the lives of students and their families, higher education
   institutions, and society as a whole. The dataset described here results
   from the aggregation of information from different disjointed data
   sources and includes demographic, socioeconomic, macroeconomic, and
   academic data on enrollment and academic performance at the end of the
   first and second semesters. The dataset is used to build machine
   learning models for predicting academic performance and dropout, which
   is part of a Learning Analytic tool developed at the Polytechnic
   Institute of Portalegre that provides information to the tutoring team
   with an estimate of the risk of dropout and failure. The dataset is
   useful for researchers who want to conduct comparative studies on
   student academic performance and also for training in the machine
   learning area.},

Title = {The potential for student performance prediction in small cohorts with

Abstract = {The measurement of student performance during their progress through
   university study provides academic leadership with critical information
   on each student's likelihood of success. Academics have traditionally
   used their interactions with individual students through class
   activities and interim assessments to identify those ``at risk{''} of
   failure/withdrawal. However, modern university environments, offering
   easy on-line availability of course material, may see reduced
   lecture/tutorial attendance, making such identification more
   challenging. Modern data mining and machine learning techniques provide
   increasingly accurate predictions of student examination assessment
   marks, although these approaches have focussed upon large student
   populations and wide ranges of data attributes per student. However,
   many university modules comprise relatively small student cohorts, with
   institutional protocols limiting the student attributes available for
   analysis. It appears that very little research attention has been
   devoted to this area of analysis and prediction. We describe an
   experiment conducted on a final-year university module student cohort of
   23, where individual student data are limited to lecture/tutorial
   attendance, virtual learning environment accesses and intermediate

Abstract = {Educational Data Mining (EDM) is a branch of data mining that focuses on
   extraction of useful knowledge from data generated through academic
   activities at school, college or at university level. The extracted
   knowledge can help to perform the academic activities in a better way,
   so it is useful for students, parents and institutions themselves. One
   common activity in EDM is students grade prediction with an aim to
   identify weak or at-risk students. An early identification of such
   students helps to take supportive measures that may help students to
   improve. Among a vast number of approaches available in this field, this
   study mainly focuses on generating a smarter dataset through reduced
   feature set without compromising the number of records in it and then
   producing an approach which combines the strengths of classification and
   clustering for better prediction results. In this study it has been
   identified that individual features have distinct effect and that
   removing misclassified data can affect the overall results. Backward
   selection is adopted using Pearson correlation as a metric to produce
   smarter dataset with lesser attributes and better accuracy in
   prediction. After feature set selection, we have applied EMT (Ensemble
   Meta-Based Tree Model) classification on it to identify best performing
   classifiers from five families of classifiers. In hybrid approach, first
   the ensemble clustering is applied on smart dataset and then EMT
   classification is applied to reevaluate the un-clustered data, which
   gives a boost in performance and provides us an accuracy of 93\%.},

Abstract = {Recently, tracking student behavior has become a very important phase
   for constructing adaptive educational systems. Several researchers have
   developed various methods based on machine learning for better tracing
   students' knowledge. Most of these methods have shown an effective
   estimation of student features and an accurate prediction of future
   performance. However, these methods recognized certain limitations since
   they use only the correctness of prior student responses to make
   predictions without paying attention to many other important student
   behaviors. In addition, researchers have only considered scaffolding
   items as a pure method of learning without having analyzed student
   performance at the time of answering these items. Our purpose in this
   article is to conduct an experiment that aims to evaluate how best to
   use data about the prior required scaffolding items to predict future
   student performance. For this reason, we proposed two separate models,
   namely, the first one identifies whether a student has previously
   required to use scaffolding items prior main question or has immediately
   answered it without requiring assistance. For the second model, as an
   improvement of model 1, our objective is to improve the student's
   performance under the constraint of answering scaffolding items. The
   performance of our two models is evaluated against the original
   Performance Factors Analysis algorithm to mark differences. The results
   show that the two proposed models provide a positive improvement in
   predicting the future performance of students. Moreover, our second
   model can reliably increase the predictive accuracy.},

Abstract = {The educational data mining (EDM) can be specified as one of the main
   fields related to high-quality research that involves mining datasets to
   address research questions related to education; such questions examine
   the ways in which people learn and teach. a large amount of data,
   including education data, are being collected, and much of them are
   unprocessed. The success of EDM was examined in this paper, and nine
   data mining techniques were explored including: bagging, multilayer
   perception (MLP), naive Bayes (NB), K-nearest neighbours (KNN), logistic
   regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), XGBoost, decision tree
   (DT), and random forest (RF). Such techniques were used on an
   educational dataset obtained from certain learning management system
   which is referred to as Kalboard 360. This paper involves three major
   steps. Firstly, student performance model that contains exceptional
   feature's category, that are referred to as behavioural features, is
   introduced. Secondly, the dataset is pre-processed, and the
   pre-processing steps involve transforming the raw data into a usable
   format and verifying the connections between independent and dependent
   variables in sample dataset, which has been also referred to as the
   training dataset. Thirdly, the nine data mining approaches have been
   utilized on the acquired dataset to classify student performance into
   low, middle, and high levels. Afterwards, the performance measures were
   examined by using recall, precision, accuracy, as well as F1 score. RF
   (89\%) obtained the best accuracy also other techniques were ordered in
   terms of accuracy: bagging (85\%) > XGBoost 84\% > NB (81\%) > LR (81\%)
   > MLP (77\%) > DT (76\%) > SVM (72\%) > KNN (68\%). Results were
   compared by using divided datasets (80:20 ratio) (80 for training: 20
   for testing).},

Title = {E-learning enhancement through educational data mining with Covid-19
   outbreak period in backdrop: A review},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {101},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {E-learning is fast becoming an integral part of the teaching-learning
   process, particularly after the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic.
   Educational institutions across the globe are striving to enhance their
   e-learning instruc-tional mechanism in accordance with the aspirations
   of present-day students who are widely using numerous technological
   tools - computers, tablets, mobiles, and Internet for educational
   purposes. In the wake of the evident incorporation of e-learning into
   the educational process, research related to the application of
   Educa-tional Data Mining (EDM) techniques for enhancing e-learning
   systems has gained significance in recent times. The various data mining
   techniques applied by researchers to study hidden trends or patterns in
   educational data can provide valuable insights for educational
   institutions in terms of making the learning process adaptive to student
   needs. The insights can help the institutions achieve their ultimate
   goal of improving student academic performance in technology-assisted
   learning systems of the modern world. This review paper aims to
   compre-hend EDM's role in enhancing e-learning environments with
   reference to commonly-used techniques, along with student performance
   prediction, the impact of Covid-19 pandemic on e-learning and priority
   e-learning focus areas in the future.},

Abstract = {Students at Saudi universities face difficulty registering for the right
   course since Student performance there is no support offered to students
   that uniquely consider each situation. Machine learning techniques could
   be applied to fill this gap by predicting grades of new courses for each
   student based on their historical data. This paper experiments with nine
   different prediction algorithms to predict course grades for public
   university students. The data-set includes grades for 215 students and
   180 various courses. The models utilize grades obtained in semesters
   between the 2015 and 2018 academic years and evaluated on grades
   obtained in the 2019 academic year. Our result shows that the K-nearest
   neighbor with ZScore model outperforms the remaining models with respect
   to the Percentage of Tick Accuracy (PTA), which is the difference
   between two consecutive letter grades for the predicted letter grade and
   the observed letter grade. Our work achieved an 84\% accuracy score in
   PTA2, where the difference between the predicted letter grade and the
   actual letter grade is less than or equal to two consecutive letter
   grades.},

Abstract = {A major problem an instructor experiences is the systematic monitoring
   of students' academic progress in a course. The moment the students,
   with unsatisfactory academic progress, are identified the instructor can
   take measures to offer additional support to the struggling students.
   The fact is that the modern-day educational institutes tend to collect
   enormous amount of data concerning their students from various sources,
   however, the institutes are craving novel procedures to utilize the data
   to magnify their prestige and improve the education quality. This
   research evaluates the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms to
   monitor students' academic progress and informs the instructor about the
   students at the risk of ending up with unsatisfactory result in a
   course. In addition, the prediction model is transformed into a clear
   shape to make it easy for the instructor to prepare the necessary
   precautionary procedures. We developed a set of prediction models with
   distinct machine learning algorithms. Decision tree triumph over other
   models and thus is further transformed into easily explicable format.
   The final output of the research turns into a set of supportive measures
   to carefully monitor students' performance from the very start of the
   course and a set of preventive measures to offer additional attention to
   the struggling students.},

Abstract = {Apparently, most life activities that people perform depend on their
   unique characteristics. Personal characteristics vary across people, so
   they perform tasks in different ways based on their skills. People have
   different mental, psychological, and behavioral features that affect
   most life activities. This is the same case with students at various
   educational levels. Students have different features that affect their
   academic performance. The academic score is the main indicator of the
   student's performance. However, other factors such as personality
   features, intelligence level, and basic personal data can have a great
   influence on the student's performance. This means that the academic
   score is not the only indicator that can be used in predicting students'
   performance. Consequently, an approach based on personal data,
   personality features, and intelligence quotient is proposed to predict
   the performance of university undergraduates. Five machine learning
   techniques were used in the proposed approach. In order to evaluate the
   performance of the proposed approach, a real student's dataset was used,
   and various performance measures were computed. Several experiments were
   performed to determine the impact of various features on the student's
   performance. The proposed approach gave promising results when tested on
   the dataset.},

Abstract = {Currently, educational data mining act as a major part of student
   performance prediction approaches and their applications. However, more
   ensemble methods are needed to improve the student performance
   prediction, and also which helps increase the learning quality of the
   Student's performance. The usage of an ensemble classifier with rule
   mining to predict students' academic success is proposed. In response to
   this need, this research mainly concentrated on an ensemble classifier
   with rule mining to predict students' academic success. The feature
   mining is performed using the weighted Rough Set Theory method, in which
   the proposed meta-heuristic algorithm optimizes the weight function. The
   variable optimization of the ensemble classifier is accomplished with
   the help of a combination of Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO), and Krill
   Herd Algorithm (KHA) known as Escape Energy Searched Krill Herd-Harris
   Hawks Optimization (EES-KHHO) for maximizing the prediction rate.
   Extensive tests are carried out on various datasets, and the findings
   show that our technique outperforms conventional approaches. Throughout
   the result analysis, the offered method attains a 92.77\% accuracy rate,
   and also it attains a sensitivity rate of 94.87\%. Therefore, the
   offered student performance prediction model achieves better
   effectiveness regarding various performance metrics.},

Abstract = {Institutions of higher learning have made persistent efforts to provide
   students with a high-quality education. Educational data mining (EDM)
   enables academic institutions to gain insight into student data in order
   to extract information for making predictions. COVID-19 represents the
   most catastrophic pandemic in human history. As a result of the global
   pandemic, all educational systems were shifted to online learning (OL).
   Due to issues with accessing the internet, disinterest, and a lack of
   available tools, online education has proven challenging for many
   students. Acquiring accurate education has emerged as a major goal for
   the future of this popular medium of education. Therefore, the focus of
   this research was to identifying attributes that could help in students'
   performance prediction through a generalizable model achieving precision
   education in online education. The dataset used in this research was
   compiled from a survey taken primarily during the academic year of
   COVID-19, which was taken from the perspective of Pakistani university
   students. Five machine learning (ML) regressors were used in order to
   train the model, and its results were then analyzed. Comparatively, SVM
   has outperformed the other methods, yielding 87.5\% accuracy, which was
   the highest of all the models tested. After that, an efficient hybrid
   ensemble model of machine learning was used to predict student
   performance using NB, KNN, SVM, decision tree, and logical regression
   during the COVID-19 period, yielding outclass results. Finally, the
   accuracy obtained through the hybrid ensemble model was obtained as
   98.6\%, which demonstrated that the hybrid ensemble learning model has
   performed better than any other model for predicting the performance of
   students.},

Abstract = {The educational data mining researchers have achieved significant
   efficiency in predicting student performance during the tenure of the
   course. However, an early prediction before course commencement is still
   a research challenge. Such advanced forecast can help the teachers in
   providing timely assistance to uplift the academic performance of a
   student, reduce the number of failures and performance degradations.
   Importantly, an additional measure of prediction confidence can be
   useful in this regard to decide the magnitude of the assistance
   required. The primary objective of this study is to predict the failure,
   degradation and improvement before course commencement. A real dataset
   containing nearly 0.6 million records is used here for this purpose. We
   have initially applied multiple state-of-the-art classifiers on this
   dataset to predict the performance in binary terms. Unfortunately, these
   classifiers could not perform well, and they are unable to provide the
   desired prediction confidence as well. We have therefore proposed a
   novel scalable algorithm, named random wheel, for classification. It not
   only works efficiently on this dataset but also works well with other
   benchmarked datasets. The proposed classifier provides an additional
   measure to indicate the prediction confidence. It, in turn, increases
   the acceptability of the prediction.},

Abstract = {Predicting students' performance during their years of academic study
   has been investigated tremendously. It offers important insights that
   can help and guide institutions to make timely decisions and changes
   leading to better student outcome achievements. In the post-COVID-19
   pandemic era, the adoption of e-learning has gained momentum and has
   increased the availability of online related learning data. This has
   encouraged researchers to develop machine learning (ML)-based models to
   predict students' performance during online classes. The study presented
   in this paper, focuses on predicting student performance during a series
   of online interactive sessions by considering a dataset collected using
   digital electronics education and design suite. The dataset tracks the
   interaction of students during online lab work in terms of text editing,
   a number of keystrokes, time spent in each activity, etc., along with
   the exam score achieved per session. Our proposed prediction model
   consists of extracting a total of 86 novel statistical features, which
   were semantically categorized in three broad categories based on
   different criteria: (1) activity type, (2) timing statistics, and (3)
   peripheral activity count. This set of features were further reduced
   during the feature selection phase and only influential features were
   retained for training purposes. Our proposed ML model aims to predict
   whether a student's performance will be low or high. Five popular
   classifiers were used in our study, namely: random forest (RF), support
   vector machine, Naive Bayes, logistic regression, and multilayer
   perceptron. We evaluated our model under three different scenarios: (1)
   80:20 random data split for training and testing, (2) fivefold
   cross-validation, and (3) train the model on all sessions but one which
   will be used for testing. Results showed that our model achieved the
   best classification accuracy performance of 97.4\% with the RF
   classifier. We demonstrated that, under similar experimental setup, our
   model outperformed other existing studies.},

Abstract = {In order to improve the effect of college student performance
   prediction, based on machine learning and neural network algorithms,
   this paper improves the traditional data processing algorithms and
   proposes a similarity calculation method for courses. Moreover, this
   paper uses cosine similarity to calculate the similarity of courses.
   Simultaneously, this paper proposes an improved hybrid multi-weight
   improvement algorithm to improve the cold start problem that cannot be
   solved by traditional algorithms. In addition, this paper combines the
   neural network structure to construct a model framework structure, sets
   the functional modules according to actual needs, and analyzes and
   predicts students' personal performance through student portraits.
   Finally, this paper designs experiments to analyze the effectiveness of
   the model proposed in this paper. From the experimental data, it can be
   seen that the model proposed in this paper basically meets the expected

Abstract = {For a productive life, education plays a critical role to fill
   individual life with value and excellence. Education is compulsory to
   provide things that individuals partake in to compete in the modern
   world. Predicting the academic performance of the student is the most
   successive research in this era. A different set of approaches and
   methods are incorporated to increase student performance. However, this
   is a challenging task due to the wrong course selection. In the proposed
   study, we have used the hybrid approach consisting of Cluster-based
   Linear Discriminant Analysis (CLDA) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
   to provide the prospective students with the motivational comments and
   the video recommendations by which students can choose the right subject
   and the comments will facilitate the students with the insight reasons
   of dropout opted by other students for this course. The outcomes of this
   study will help in the reduction of the number of dropouts. The students
   will be able to choose an appropriate course for performance enhancement
   and carrier excel.},

Abstract = {Predicting students' learning outcomes is one of the main topics of
   interest in the area of Educational Data Mining and Learning Analytics.
   To this end, a plethora of machine learning methods has been
   successfully applied for solving a variety of predictive problems.
   However, it is of utmost importance for both educators and data
   scientists to develop accurate learning models at low cost. Fuzzy logic
   constitutes an appropriate approach for building models of high
   performance and transparency. In addition, active learning reduces both
   the time and cost of labeling effort, by exploiting a small set of
   labeled data along with a large set of unlabeled data in the most
   efficient way. In addition, choosing the proper method for a given
   problem formulation and configuring the optimal parameter setting is a
   demanding task, considering the high-dimensional input space and the
   complexity of machine learning algorithms. As such, exploring the
   potential of automated machine learning (autoML) strategies from the
   perspective of machine learning adeptness is important. In this context,
   the present study introduces a fuzzy-based active learning method for
   predicting students' academic performance which combines, in a modular
   way, autoML practices. A lot of experiments was carried out, revealing
   the efficiency of the proposed method for the accurate prediction of
   students at risk of failure. These insights may have the potential to
   support the learning experience and be useful the wider science of
   learning.},

Abstract = {Early prediction of students' learning performance and analysis of
   student behavior in a virtual learning environment (VLE) are crucial to
   minimize the high failure rate in online courses during the COVID-19
   pandemic. Nevertheless, traditional machine learning models fail to
   predict student performance in the early weeks due to the lack of
   students' activities' data in a week-wise timely manner (i.e.,
   spatiotemporal feature issues). Furthermore, the imbalanced data
   distribution in the VLE impacts the prediction model performance. Thus,
   there are severe challenges in handling spatiotemporal features,
   imbalanced data sets, and a lack of explainability for enhancing the
   confidence of the prediction system. Therefore, an intelligent framework
   for explainable student performance prediction (ESPP) is proposed in
   this study in order to provide the interpretability of the prediction
   results. First, this framework utilized a time-series weekly student
   activity data set and dealt with the VLE imbalanced data distribution
   using a hybrid data sampling method. Then, a combination of
   convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) was
   employed to extract the spatiotemporal features and develop the early
   prediction deep learning (DL) model. Finally, the DL model was explained
   by visualizing and analyzing typical predictions, students' activities'
   maps, and feature importance. The numerical results of cross-validation
   showed that the proposed new DL model (i.e., the combined CNN-LSTM and
   ConvLSTM), in the early prediction cases, performed better than the
   baseline models of LSTM, support vector machine (SVM), and logistic
   regression (LR) models.},

Abstract = {Analyzing students' behaviour during online classes is vital for
   teachers to identify the strengths and weaknesses of online classes.
   This analysis, based on observing academic performance and student
   activity data, helps teachers to understand the teaching outcomes. Most
   Educational Data Mining (EDM) processes analyze students' academic or
   behavioural data; in this case, the accurate prediction of student
   behaviours could not be achieved. This study addresses these issues by
   considering student's activity and academic performance datasets to
   evaluate teaching and learner outcomes efficiently. It is necessary to
   utilize a suitable method to handle the high dimensional data while
   analyzing Educational Data (ED), because academic data is growing daily
   and exponentially. This study uses two kinds of data for student
   behaviour analysis. It is essential to use feature reduction and
   selection methods to extract only important features to improve the s
   tudent's behaviour analysis performance. By utilizing a hybrid ensemble
   method to get the most relevant features to predict students'
   performance and activity levels, this approach helps to reduce the
   complexity of the feature-learning model and improve the prediction
   performance of the classification model. This study uses Improved
   Principal Component Analysis (IPCA) to select the most relevant feature.
   The resultant features of the IPCA are given as input to an ensemble
   method to select the most relevant feature sets to improve the
   prediction accuracy. The prediction is done with the help of Residual
   Network-50 (ResNet50) is combined with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to
   classify students' performance and activity during online classes. This
   performance analysis evaluates the students' behaviour analysis model.
   The proposed approach could predict the performance and activity of
   students with a maximum of 98.03\% accuracy for online classes, and
   98.06\% accuracy for exams.},

Abstract = {In the education domain, predicting the academic performance of students
   has become an essential task to improve learning outcomes. In this
   study, we propose a Modified XGBoost (MXGB) model for predicting student
   performance using stream-based analysis of the dataset. We used a
   modified version of the XGBoost algorithm using cross-validation, which
   incorporates stream-based analysis to enhance its performance on
   real-time data. We preprocessed the dataset and applied feature
   engineering techniques to extract relevant features for building the
   model. We trained the MXGB model on the preprocessed dataset and
   evaluated its performance using various metrics such as accuracy,
   precision, sensitivity, and F1-score. The results show that our model
   outperforms the baseline XGBoost model and achieves high accuracy in
   predicting the student's academic performance. Our model can assist
   educational institutions in identifying students who are at risk of
   performing poorly and providing them with timely intervention to improve
   their academic outcomes.},

Abstract = {The Educational Data Mining (EDM) is a very vigorous area of Data Mining
   (DM), and it is helpful in predicting the performance of students.
   Student performance prediction is not only important for the student but
   also helpful for academic organization to detect the causes of success
   and failures of students. Furthermore, the features selected through the
   students' performance prediction models helps in developing action plans
   for academic welfare. Feature selection can increase the prediction
   accuracy of the prediction model. In student performance prediction
   model, where every feature is very important, as a neglection of any
   important feature can cause the wrong development of academic action
   plans. Moreover, the feature selection is a very important step in the
   development of student performance prediction models. There are
   different types of feature selection algorithms. In this paper, Fast
   Correlation-Based Filter (FCBF) is selected as a feature selection
   algorithm. This paper is a step on the way to identifying the factors
   affecting the academic performance of the students. In this paper
   performance of FCBF is being evaluated on three different student's
   datasets. The performance of FCBF is detected well on a student dataset

Abstract = {With the widespread popularity of intelligent education, artificial
   intelligence plays an important role in the field of education.
   Currently, there are issues such as low accuracy and low adaptability.
   By comparing algorithms such as logistic regression, decision tree,
   random forest (RF), support vector machine, and long short-term memory
   (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN), this article adopted a
   multi-classification fusion strategy and fully considered the
   adaptability of the algorithm to evaluate and grade students in two
   scenarios with different grades and teaching quality. By encoding and
   normalizing student grades, six evaluation parameters were selected for
   the evaluation criteria of teaching quality through principal component
   analysis feature selection. Multi-classifier models were used to fuse
   the five models in pairs, improving the accuracy of the experimental
   evaluation. Finally, the experimental data of the six fused
   multi-classification models in the scenarios of student performance
   estimation and teaching quality estimation were compared, and the
   experimental effects of education evaluation and grading under different
   models were analyzed. The experimental results showed that the LSTM
   RNN-RF model had the strongest adaptability in the scenario of student
   performance estimation, with an estimation accuracy of 98.5\%, which was
   12.9\% higher than a single RF model. This experiment was closely
   related to educational scenarios and fully considered the adaptability
   of different machine learning algorithms to different scenarios,
   improving the prediction and classification accuracy of the model.},

Title = {Leveraging the Innovation-Based Learning Framework to Predict a
   Understand Student Success in Innovation},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Pages = {36123-36139},
Abstract = {As more educational data becomes available, learning analytics and
   educational data mining are allowing instructors to make data-driven
   decisions like never before. Much of the work in learning analytics and
   educational data mining has been done in traditional subjects like math
   and reading, but these tools also have the potential to shape our
   understanding of the complexity of engineering design and innovation.
   This work uses learning analytics and educational data mining to analyze
   and interpret student data collected in a course where students work on
   innovation projects. Specifically, this work improves previous
   classification models developed for innovation in classroom settings by
   implementing the Innovation-Based Learning (IBL) Framework - a
   qualitative model that sorts student actions into seven categories. The
   models developed include 1) a text classifier that automatically groups
   student text into the categories of the IBL framework with higher
   reliability than a team of human raters (kappa = 0.760 versus kappa =
   0.627), 2) a text classifier that uses the IBL framework to predict
   student performance on new cohorts better than previously developed
   models (ROC AUC = 0.710 versus ROC AUC = 0.640), and 3) a quantitative
   classifier that uses the IBL framework to differentiate between lower
   and higher performing students better than previously developed models
   (ROC AUC = 0.782 versus ROC AUC = 0.491). Not only does this work detail
   the development and testing of these models, but it also uses the
   results to suggest best practices of teaching innovation in educational
   settings.},

Abstract = {The precision of predicting student performance in Mathematics is
   pivotal for educational advancement, relying heavily on advanced machine
   learning (ML) methodologies. This predictive approach involves analyzing
   comprehensive datasets, emphasizing academic records, demographics, and
   various educational metrics, with a particular focus on Mathematics.
   Techniques like classification, regression analysis, decision trees, and
   neural networks yield highly accurate projections, aiding in timely
   interventions crucial for supporting students navigating mathematical
   complexities. These algorithms optimize resource allocation within
   educational institutions, identifying and aiding students requiring
   extra assistance in their mathematical pursuits. This study pioneers the
   enhancement of predictive capabilities in Mathematics through the
   innovative integration of the K-Nearest Neighbor Classification (KNNC)
   model with 2 novel optimization techniques: the Honey Badger Algorithm
   (HBA) and the Arithmetic Optimization Algorithm (AOA). By harnessing
   these cutting-edge ML and bio-inspired algorithms, the research is
   dedicated to pushing the boundaries of precision and reliability in
   forecasting, with a specific focus on elevating educational outcomes
   within the domain of Mathematics. The outcomes obtained for G1 and G3
   reveal that the KNHB model exhibited outstanding performance in
   predicting and categorizing G3. It achieved remarkable Accuracy and
   Precision of 0.921 and 0.92, respectively. Moreover, the KNHB proved to
   be the most precise predictor for G1 value prediction, with Accuracy and
   Precision scores of 0.899\% and 0.9\%, respectively, in the prediction
   task.},

Abstract = {Education is essential and increasingly crucial for the development of
   almost all countries worldwide. As educational data has become
   increasingly available, scholars have shown a growing interest in
   exploring the correlation between students' academic achievements and
   other factors that may impact their performance using machine learning
   algorithms. This research paper introduces a novel hybrid classifier
   that aims to predict the academic performance of students by using a
   combination of di ff erent single algorithms. The proposed hybrid
   classifier (PHC) is compared to six available classification algorithms
   (random forest (RF), C4.5, classification and regression trees (CART),
   support vector machines (SVM), naive Bayes (NB) and K -nearest neighbors
   (KNN)) using recall, precision, F1 -score, and accuracy evaluation
   measures. Our experimental results reveal that the PHC classifier
   consistently outperforms the individual classifiers across multiple
   evaluation metrics. Specifically, the PHC classifier achieved an
   accuracy rate of 92.40\%, surpassing the RF, C4.5, and CART classifiers,
   which were the next best performers. In terms of precision and F1 score,
   the PHC also demonstrated superior performance, indicating its
   robustness in correctly identifying positive instances and providing
   balanced accuracy. While the C4.5 classifier performed comparably to the
   PHC classifier concerning the recall metric, the hybrid model's overall
   performance highlights its e ff ectiveness in leveraging the
   complementary strengths of the included classifiers. The suggested
   hybrid model has the potential to enhance students' academic performance
   and success more e ff ectively and e ffi ciently. It could benefit
   students, educators, and academic institutions. Additionally, it
   provides practical insights for educators and institutions striving to
   improve student achievement using predictive analysis.},

Title = {Predicting Academic Performance Using an Efficient Model Based on Fusion

Abstract = {In the past few years, educational data mining (EDM) has attracted the
   attention of researchers to enhance the quality of education. Predicting
   student academic performance is crucial to improving the value of
   education. Some research studies have been conducted which mainly
   focused on prediction of students' performance at higher education.
   However, research related to performance prediction at the secondary
   level is scarce, whereas the secondary level tends to be a benchmark to
   describe students' learning progress at further educational levels.
   Students' failure or poor grades at lower secondary negatively impact
   them at the higher secondary level. Therefore, early prediction of
   performance is vital to keep students on a progressive track. This
   research intended to determine the critical factors that affect the
   performance of students at the secondary level and to build an efficient
   classification model through the fusion of single and ensemble-based
   classifiers for the prediction of academic performance. Firstly, three
   single classifiers including a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), J48, and
   PART were observed along with three well-established ensemble algorithms
   encompassing Bagging (BAG), MultiBoost (MB), and Voting (VT)
   independently. To further enhance the performance of the abovementioned
   classifiers, nine other models were developed by the fusion of single
   and ensemble-based classifiers. The evaluation results showed that
   MultiBoost with MLP outperformed the others by achieving 98.7\%
   accuracy, 98.6\% precision, recall, and F-score. The study implies that
   the proposed model could be useful in identifying the academic
   performance of secondary level students at an early stage to improve the
   learning outcomes.},

Abstract = {The application of intelligent systems in the higher education sector is
   an active field of research, powered by the abundance of available data
   and by the urgency to define effective, data-driven strategies to
   overcome students' dropout and improve students' academic performance.
   This work applies machine learning techniques to develop prediction
   models that can contribute to the early detection of students at risk of
   dropping out or not finishing their degree in due time. It also
   evaluates the best moment for performing the prediction along the
   student's enrollment year. The models are built on data of undergraduate
   students from a Polytechnic University in Portugal, enrolled between
   2009 and 2017, comprising academic, social-demographic, and
   macroeconomic information at three different phases during the first
   academic year of the students. Five machine learning algorithms are used
   to train prediction models at each phase, and the most relevant features
   for the top performing models are identified. Results show that the best
   models use Random Forest, either incorporating strategies to deal with
   the imbalanced nature of the data or using such strategies at the data
   level. The best results are obtained at the end of the first semester,
   when some information about the academic performance after enrollment is
   already available. The overall results compare fairly with some similar
   works that address the early prediction of students' dropout or academic
   performance.},

   Time-Series Data Analysis Approach},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},

Abstract = {As an emerging teaching method, online learning is becoming increasingly
   popular among learners. However, one of the major drawbacks of this
   learning style is the lack of effective communication and feedback,
   which can lead to a higher risk of students failing or dropping out. In
   response to this challenge, this paper proposes a student performance
   prediction model based on multidimensional time-series data analysis by
   considering multidimensional data such as students' learning behaviors,
   assessment scores, and demographic information, which is able to extract
   the characteristics of students' learning behaviors and capture the
   connection between multiple characteristics to better explore the impact
   of multiple factors on students' performance. The model proposed in this
   paper helps teachers to individualize education for students at
   different levels of proficiency and identifies at-risk students as early
   as possible to help teachers intervene in a timely manner. In
   experiments on the Open University Learning Analytics Dataset (OULAD),
   the model achieved 74\% accuracy and 73\% F1 scores in a four-category
   prediction task and was able to achieve 99.08\% accuracy and 99.08\% F1
   scores in an early risk prediction task. Compared with the benchmark
   model, both the multi-classification prediction ability and the early
   prediction ability, the model in this paper has a better performance.},

Abstract = {Educational data mining has attracted significant consideration over the
   last few years. Information that is stored online using educational
   systems is increasing tremendously. The online learning environment can
   be improved by analysing and mining this information to extract
   representative features about students' behaviour and academic skills.
   Various classifiers are investigated to analyse the prediction of
   students' academic performance based on the attributes from the
   Kalboard360 learning management system (LMS). The selection of
   significant features can substantially improve the prediction, hence,
   ANOVA and Chi-square filter approaches and forward feature selection and
   backward feature elimination wrapper approaches are examined for their
   efficacy. Results reveal that an extra tree classifier can achieve an
   accuracy of 0.8755 when trained on backward feature elimination selected
   features. Wrapper approaches prove to be effective in determining the
   most significant attributes for student performance prediction. `Visited
   resources', `raised hands', `relation', `parent answering survey', and
   `student absent days' are regarded as the most significant attributes to
   determine student performance. Education specialists and institutions
   can leverage these findings to improve the student learning process and
   enhance their academic performance.},

Abstract = {In the context of programming language courses, offering early and
   personalized assistance to students with difficulties in solving code
   exercises is fundamental to helping them improve their performance. To
   this end, it is desirable to detect those students with behavioral
   patterns that could potentially result in poor performance in a timely
   manner. In this study, we analyze different behavioral metrics for
   predicting the performance of students in a 2nd-year computer science
   course. Metrics are extracted from practical sessions, that is, code
   exercise labs that may be finished online during a period of 5-7 days.
   In addition to well-known metrics (e.g., the relative time spent solving
   compilation/execution errors or skills for removing compilation errors),
   we also incorporate metrics that take into account the work habits of
   students (e.g., timestamps in which the student has undertaken 25\%,
   50\%, and 75\% of the exercise lab) and similarity between codes. With a
   sample of 224 students from seven different course groups, we construct
   robust predictors by training different machine learning models,
   reaching an R-2 value of up to 0.40. We also perform a machine
   learning-based analysis for detecting the most relevant response
   variables and analyze their relations to the final grades of students.
   The results show that the newly considered metrics have enough
   predictive power to be considered in the model. Finally, we graphically
   illustrate the nonlinear and seemingly interdependent relations that
   exist between predictor and response variables.},

Abstract = {As education is an essential enabler in achieving Sustainable
   Development Goals (SDGs), it should ``ensure inclusive, equitable
   quality education, and promote lifelong learning opportunities for
   all{''}. One of the frameworks for SDG 4 is to propose the concepts of
   ``equitable quality education{''}. To attain and work in the context of
   SDG 4, artificial intelligence (AI) is a booming technology, which is
   gaining interest in understanding student behavior and assessing student
   performance. AI holds great potential for improving education as it has
   started to develop innovative teaching and learning approaches in
   education to create better learning. To provide better education, data
   analytics is critical. AI and machine learning approaches provide rapid
   solutions with high accuracy. This paper presents an AI-based analytics
   tool created to predict student performance in a first-year Information
   Technology literacy course at The University of the South Pacific (USP).
   A Random Forest based classification model was developed which predicted
   the performance of the student in week 6 with an accuracy value of
   97.03\%, sensitivity value of 95.26\%, specificity value of 98.8\%,
   precision value of 98.86\%, Matthews correlation coefficient value of
   94\% and Area Under the ROC Curve value of 99\%. Hence, such a method is
   very useful in predicting student performance early in their courses of
   allowing for early intervention. During the COVID-19 outbreak, the
   experimental findings demonstrate that the suggested prediction model
   satisfies the required accuracy, precision, and recall factors for
   forecasting the behavioural elements of teaching and e-learning for
   students in virtual education systems.},

Abstract = {Predicting students' academic performance has been a research area of
   interest in recent years, with many institutions focusing on improving
   the students' performance and the education quality. The analysis and
   prediction of students' performance can be achieved using various data
   mining techniques. Moreover, such techniques allow instructors to
   determine possible factors that may affect the students' final marks. To
   that end, this work analyzes two different undergraduate datasets at two
   different universities. Furthermore, this work aims to predict the
   students' performance at two stages of course delivery (20\% and 50\%
   respectively). This analysis allows for properly choosing the
   appropriate machine learning algorithms to use as well as optimize the
   algorithms' parameters. Furthermore, this work adopts a systematic
   multi-split approach based on Gini index and p-value. This is done by
   optimizing a suitable bagging ensemble learner that is built from any
   combination of six potential base machine learning algorithms. It is
   shown through experimental results that the posited bagging ensemble
   models achieve high accuracy for the target group for both datasets.},

Abstract = {The students' performance prediction (SPP) problem is a challenging
   problem that managers face at any institution. Collecting educational
   quantitative and qualitative data from many resources such as exam
   centers, virtual courses, e-learning educational systems, and other
   resources is not a simple task. Even after collecting data, we might
   face imbalanced data, missing data, biased data, and different data
   types such as strings, numbers, and letters. One of the most common
   challenges in this area is the large number of attributes (features).
   Determining the highly valuable features is needed to improve the
   overall students' performance. This paper proposes an evolutionary-based
   SPP model utilizing an enhanced form of the Whale Optimization Algorithm
   (EWOA) as a wrapper feature selection to keep the most informative
   features and enhance the prediction quality. The proposed EWOA combines
   the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) with Sine Cosine Algorithm (SCA)
   and Logistic Chaotic Map (LCM) to improve the overall performance of
   WOA. The SCA will empower the exploitation process inside WOA and
   minimize the probability of being stuck in local optima. The main idea
   is to enhance the worst half of the population in WOA using SCA.
   Besides, LCM strategy is employed to control the population diversity
   and improve the exploration process. As such, we handled the imbalanced
   data using the Adaptive Synthetic (ADASYN) sampling technique and
   converting WOA to binary variant employing transfer functions (TFs) that
   belong to different families (S-shaped and V-shaped). Two real
   educational datasets are used, and five different classifiers are
   employed: the Decision Trees (DT), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Naive
   Bayes (NB), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and LogitBoost (LB). The
   obtained results show that the LDA classifier is the most reliable
   classifier with both datasets. In addition, the proposed EWOA
   outperforms other methods in the literature as wrapper feature selection
   with selected transfer functions.</p>},

Abstract = {Educational data mining is becoming a more and more popular research
   field in recent years, mainly with the help of cross research conducted
   by various disciplines, so as to solve various difficult problems in the
   teaching and education process. In this paper, we proposed a hybrid
   approach for student performance prediction. We collected the dataset,
   including 15 characteristics of students from three categories
   (individual basic information, individual education information, and
   individual behavior information). Based on the random forest (RF) and
   simulated annealing (SA) algorithms, we binary encode the relevant
   parameters (number of features, tree size, and tree decision weights) as
   the target variables for algorithm optimization, use the out-of-bag
   error as the optimization objective function, and then propose the IRFC
   (improved random forest classifier) algorithm in this paper. Compared
   with other mainstream improved random forest algorithms, the research
   results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm in this paper has higher
   generalization ability and smaller OOB error. This study provides a
   methodological reference for the prediction of student achievement and
   also makes a marginal contribution to student management work.},

Abstract = {To obtain more accurate and robust feedback information from the
   students' assessment outcomes and to communicate it to students and
   optimize teaching and learning strategies, educational researchers and
   practitioners must critically reflect on whether the existing methods of
   data analytics are capable of retrieving the information provided in the
   database. This study compared and contrasted the prediction performance
   of an item response theory method, particularly the use of an
   explanatory item response model (EIRM), and six supervised machine
   learning (ML) methods for predicting students' item responses in
   educational assessments, considering student- and item-related
   background information. Each of seven prediction methods was evaluated
   through cross-validation approaches under three prediction scenarios:
   (a) unrealized responses of new students to existing items, (b)
   unrealized responses of existing students to new items, and (c) missing
   responses of existing students to existing items. The results of a
   simulation study and two real-life assessment data examples showed that
   employing student- and item-related background information in addition
   to the item response data substantially increases the prediction
   accuracy for new students or items. We also found that the EIRM is as
   competitive as the best performing ML methods in predicting the student
   performance outcomes for the educational assessment datasets.},

Abstract = {Cooperative learning is a pedagogical approach in which students
   collaborate in small groups to attain a shared academic objective. In
   the classroom, cooperative learning aims to enhance learning outcomes by
   promoting the exchange of information, social, and personal resources
   among students. Group formation is a critical and complex step that
   significantly impacts the effectiveness of cooperative learning. In this
   article, we propose a novel approach for constructing cooperative
   learning groups that employs machine learning to predict student
   performance and incorporates the most common grouping strategies to
   recommend optimal group formation.},

Title = {Can Working Memory Task-Related EEG Biomarkers Measure Fluid
   Intelligence and Predict Academic Achievement in Healthy Children?},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN BEHAVIORAL NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {14},
Month = {JAN 22},
Abstract = {Background Educational psychology research has linked fluid intelligence
   (Gf) with working memory (WM), but it is still dubious whether
   electroencephalography (EEG) markers robustly indicate Gf. This study
   addresses this issue and notes the relationship between WM task-related
   EEG markers with Gf and academic performance. Method A sample of 62
   healthy children between the ages of 9 and 12 years was selected to
   perform three tasks: (1) Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices (RSPM)
   test to assess Gf; (2) 2-back task to assess central executive system
   (CES); and (3) delayed match-to-sample task to assess short-term
   storage. These subjects were divided into high ability (HA) and low
   ability (LA) groups based on their RSPM scores. Support vector machine
   and logistic regression were used to train the EEG candidate indicators.
   A multiple regression was used to predict children's academic
   performance using P3 amplitude, P2 latency, and theta-ERS. Results
   Behavioral results demonstrated that the correct rate of the HA group is
   higher than that of the LA group. The event-related potential results of
   the 2-back task showed that the P3 amplitude of the HA group was
   relatively larger and that the P2 latency was shorter than that observed
   in the LA group. For the delayed matching to sample task, the theta-ERS
   of the LA group was higher than that of the HA group. However, the area
   under the curve of these three indicators for Gf was < 0.75 for each and
   < 0.85 for the combined indicators. In predicting academic performance,
   only P3 amplitude showed a significant effect. Conclusion These results
   challenge previous findings, which reported that P3, P2, or theta power
   might be used in standard psychometric tests to assess an individual's
   intelligence.},

Abstract = {Educational data generated through various platforms such as e-learning,
   e-admission systems, and automated result management systems can be
   effectively processed through educational data mining techniques in
   order to gather highly useful insights into students' performance. The
   prediction of student performance from historical academic data is a
   highly desirable application of educational data mining. In this regard,
   there is an urgent need to develop an automated technique for student
   performance prediction. Existing studies on student performance
   prediction primarily focus on utilizing the conventional feature
   representation schemes, where extracted features are fed to a
   classifier. In recent years, deep learning has enabled researchers to
   automatically extract high-level features from raw data. Such advanced
   feature representation schemes enable superior performance in
   challenging tasks. In this work, we examine the deep neural network
   model, namely, the attention-based Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory
   (BiLSTM) network to efficiently predict student performance (grades)
   from historical data. In this article, we have used the most advanced
   BiLSTM combined with an attention mechanism model by analyzing existing
   research problems, which are based on advanced feature classification
   and prediction. This work is really vital for academicians,
   universities, and government departments to early predict the
   performance. The superior sequence learning capabilities of BiLSTM
   combined with attention mechanism yield superior performance compared to
   the existing state-of-the-art. The proposed method has achieved a
   prediction accuracy of 90.16\%.},

Title = {Evaluating Student Knowledge Assessment Using Machine Learning
   Techniques},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {7},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The process of learning about a student's knowledge and comprehension of
   a particular subject is referred to as student knowledge assessment. It
   helps to identify areas where students need additional support or
   challenge and can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of instruction,
   make important decisions such as on student placement and curriculum
   development, and monitor the quality of education. Evaluating student
   knowledge assessment is essential to measuring student progress,
   informing instruction, and providing feedback to improve student
   performance and enhance the overall teaching and learning experience.
   This research paper is designed to create a machine learning (ML)-based
   system that assesses student performance and knowledge throughout the
   course of their studies and pinpoints the key variables that have the
   most significant effects on that performance and expertise.
   Additionally, it describes the impact of running models with data that
   only contains key features on their performance. To classify the
   students, the paper employs seven different classifiers, including
   support vector machines (SVM), logistic regression (LR), random forest
   (RF), decision tree (DT), gradient boosting machine (GBM), Gaussian
   Naive Bayes (GNB), and multi-layer perceptron (MLP). This paper carries
   out two experiments to see how best to replicate the automatic
   classification of student knowledge. In the first experiment, the
   dataset (Dataset 1) was used in its original state, including all five
   properties listed in the dataset, to evaluate the performance
   indicators. In the second experiment, the least correlated variable was
   removed from the dataset to create a smaller dataset (Dataset 2), and
   the same set of performance indicators was evaluated. Then, the
   performance indicators using Dataset 1 and Dataset 2 were compared. The
   GBM exhibited the highest prediction accuracy of 98\%, according to
   Dataset 1. In terms of prediction error, the GBM also performed well.
   The accuracy of optimistic forecasts on student performance, denoted as
   the performance indicator `precision', was highest in GBM at 99\%, while
   DT, RF, and SVM were 98\% accurate in their optimistic forecasts for
   Dataset 1. The second experiment's findings demonstrated that
   practically no classifiers showed appreciable improvements in prediction
   accuracy with a reduced feature set in Dataset 2. It showed that the
   time required for related learning objects and the knowledge level
   corresponding to a goal learning object have less impact.},

Abstract = {Higher education institutions have consistently strived to provide
   students with top-notch education. To achieve better outcomes, machine
   learning (ML) algorithms greatly simplify the prediction process. ML can

   proposed an ML-based student prediction model based on the demographic,
   social, psychological, and economic factors, collectively. The dataset
   utilized for this study was compiled from a designed questionnaire
   administered to second-year undergraduate students. The objective of
   this study is to uncover factors that could assist in predicting
   students' performance. Eight ML classifiers, logistic regression, random
   forest, support vector machine, XGBoost, support vector machine with a
   linear kernel, na \& iuml;ve Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbor, and decision
   tree are used to forecast student performance. Additionally, nine
   feature selection techniques, variance threshold, XGBoost, feature
   importance, recursive feature elimination, chi-square, ridge, Pearson
   correlation, lasso, and random forest, are employed to determine optimal
   factors. The authors experimented with each technique by creating two
   sets of training and testing data with 80:20 and 70:30 proportions,
   respectively. Comparatively, the ensemble DXK (DT + XGB + KNN) model
   with cross-validation and 80:20 proportions outperformed other standard
   classifiers, achieving a highest accuracy of 97.83\%, an r-square of
   96.17\%, a precision of 97.94\%, a recall of 97.83\%, and an f1-score of
   97.88\%. These were the highest among all models tested. Additionally,
   the authors propose the ACO-DT model, which improves the prediction
   performance of the top-performing DT classifier by utilizing the Ant
   Colony Optimization technique. The findings demonstrate that the
   proposed model with 80:20 proportions achieve an accuracy of 98.15\%, an
   f1-score of 98.16\%, a precision of 98.18\%, a recall of 98.15\%, and an
   r-square of 84.75\%, surpassing all other models for forecasting student
   performance. Using the specified data size, this model creation time is
   8.49 s. The authors also recommended the future research directions to
   further enhance this study.},

Abstract = {Student performance calculation is an essential process in online
   learning scheme, which intends to afford students along with admittance
   to active learning. Student performance forecast is most concerning
   problem in education and training field, particularly in educational
   data mining (EDM). The prediction process provisions the students to
   choose courses and intend suitable training strategies for themselves.
   Furthermore, student performance calculation permits lecturers and
   educational supervisors to designate which students should be observed
   and maintained to finish their plans with finest outcomes. These
   provisions can decrease the official notices and exclusions from
   universities because of students' poor performance. In this paper,
   Political Fractional Competitive Multi-verse Optimization enabled Deep
   Neuro fuzzy network (PFCMVO enabled DNFN) uses spark framework for
   student performance calculation. Moreover, Yeo-Johnson transformation is
   applied for transforming the input data for effectual student
   performance prediction. In addition, Damerau-Levenshtein (DL) distance
   is applied to select appropriate features. The DNFN classifier is
   utilized to execute student performance prediction where the classifier
   is trained by PFCMVO algorithm. The developed student performance
   prediction model outperforms than the other existing techniques with
   respect to Precision, Recall, F-measure, and Prediction accuracy of
   0.9259, 0.9321, 0.9290, and 0.9372 for dataset-1 and 0.9126, 0.9271,

Abstract = {All educational institutions always try to investigate the learning
   behaviors of students and give early prediction toward student's
   outcomes for interventing and improving their learning performance.
   Educational data mining ( EDM) offers various effective prediction
   models to predict student performance. Simultaneously, feature selection
   (FS) is a method of EDM that is utilized to determine the dominant
   factors that are needed and sufficient for the target concept. FS method
   extracts high-quality data that reduce the complexity of the prediction
   task that can increase the robustness of decision rule. In this paper,
   we provide a comparative study of feature selection methods for
   determining dominant factors that highly affect classification
   performance and improve the performance of prediction models. A new
   feature selection CHIMI based on ranked vector score is proposed.
   Analysis of feature sets of each FS method to get the dominant set is
   executed. The experimental results show that by using the dominant set
   of the proposed CHIMI method, the classification performance of the
   proposed models is significantly improved.},

Title = {A LEARNING FUZZY COGNITIVE MAP (LFCM) APPROACH TO PREDICT STUDENT
   PERFORMANCE},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION-RESEARCH},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {20},
Abstract = {Aim/Purpose This research aims to present a brand-new approach for
   student performance prediction using the Learning Fuzzy Cognitive Map
   (LFCM) approach.
   Background Predicting student academic performance has long been an
   important research topic in many academic disciplines. Different
   mathematical models have been employed to predict student performance.
   Although the available sets of common prediction approaches, such as
   Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and regression, work well with large
   datasets, they face challenges dealing with small sample sizes, limiting
   their practical applications in real practices.
   Methodology Six distinct categories of performance antecedents are
   adopted here as course characteristics, LMS characteristics, student
   characteristics, student engagement, student support, and institutional
   factors, along with measurement items within each category. Furthermore,
   we assessed the student's overall performance using three items of
   student satisfaction score, knowledge construction level, and student
   GPA. We have collected longitudinal data from 30 postgraduates in four
   subsequent semesters and analyzed data using the Learning Fuzzy
   Cognitive Map (LFCM) technique.
   Contribution This research proposes a brand new approach, Learning Fuzzy
   Cognitive Map (LFCM), to predict student performance. Using this
   approach, we identified the most influential determinants of student
   performance, such as student engagement. Besides, this research depicts
   a model of interrelations among the student performance determinants.
   Findings The results suggest that the model reasonably predicts the
   incoming sequence when there is a limited sample size. The results also
   reveal that students' total online time and the regularity of learning
   interval in LMS have the largest effect on overall performance. The
   student engagement category also has the highest direct effect on
   student's overall performance.
   Recommendations Academic institutions can use the results and approach
   developed in this paper for Practitioners to identify students'
   performance antecedents, predict the performance, and establish action
   plans to resolve the shortcomings in the long term. Instructors can
   adjust their learning methods based on the feedback from students in the
   short run on the operational level.
   Recommendations Researchers can use the proposed approach in this
   research to deal with the for Researchers problems in other domains,
   such as using LMS for organizational/institutional education. Besides,
   they can focus on specific dimensions of the proposed model, such as
   exploring ways to boost student engagement in the learning process.
   Impact on Society Our results revealed that students are at the center
   of the learning process. The degree to which they are dedicated to
   learning is the most crucial determinant of the learning outcome.
   Therefore, learners should consider this finding in order the gain value
   from the learning process.
   Future Research As a potential for future works, the proposed approach
   could be used in other contexts to test its applicability. Future
   studies could also improve the performance level of the proposed LFMC
   model by tuning the model's elements.},

Abstract = {Predicting students' performance is one of the important tasks in
   Educational Data Mining (EDM). Early prediction can help the university
   to take actions that help students to graduate on time and have the best
   learning outcomes. It also helps the universities to save billions of
   dollars spent on students who fail, change major or dropout. In this
   paper, we report work in student performance prediction using 15
   classification algorithms. The experimental results show that we were
   able to predict students' final GPA with 91\% accuracy for two models
   Naive Bayes and Hoeffding tree which significantly outperform
   competitive models across different datasets. The average accuracy for
   all the 15 classifiers was around 71\%. We also analyzed the rules
   generated by tree-based and rule-based classifiers and found that some
   courses at early levels can have a major effect on the final GPA. In
   comparison to other works in the field, we were able to have more
   comprehensive analysis that produced better accuracy with higher
   variation of class values. These results show the potential for data
   mining to improve students' success rate by informing who are at risk in
   order for Instructors and administrators to provide the necessary
   support at the right time.},

Journal = {PLOS ONE},

Abstract = {Predicting student performance automatically is of utmost importance,
   due to the substantial volume of data within educational databases.
   Educational data mining (EDM) devises techniques to uncover insights
   from data originating in educational settings. Artificial intelligence
   (AI) can mine educational data to predict student performance and
   provide measures to help students avoid failing and learn better.
   Learning platforms complement traditional learning settings by analyzing
   student performance, which can help reduce the chance of student
   failure. Existing methods for student performance prediction in
   educational data mining faced challenges such as limited accuracy,
   imbalanced data, and difficulties in feature engineering. These issues
   hindered effective adaptability and generalization across diverse
   educational contexts. This study proposes a machine learning-based
   system with deep convoluted features for the prediction of students'
   academic performance. The proposed framework is employed to predict
   student academic performance using balanced as well as, imbalanced
   datasets using the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). In
   addition, the performance is also evaluated using the original and deep
   convoluted features. Experimental results indicate that the use of deep
   convoluted features provides improved prediction accuracy compared to
   original features. Results obtained using the extra tree classifier with
   convoluted features show the highest classification accuracy of 99.9\%.
   In comparison with the state-of-the-art approaches, the proposed
   approach achieved higher performance. This research introduces a
   powerful AI-driven system for student performance prediction, offering
   substantial advancements in accuracy compared to existing approaches.},

Abstract = {Machine learning in Education is receiving more attention from
   researchers as the number of students at all levels globally is
   increasing. To ensure students' success in K-12 educational institutions
   and higher education institutions work needs to be done to assist
   students, teachers/professors, parents, and all stakeholders to provide
   the support that students need. The need and motivation for such systems
   are very well-established and thus the aim of this work is to develop a
   system based on modified machine learning models to automatically
   predict students' performance and subsequently identify students at
   risk. The DEEDs dataset is used in this study. Novel features were
   extracted and applied to well-known classifiers some of which are
   ensemble classifiers. These classifiers were also combined with base
   learners such as bagging and boosting. The problem was divided into
   three scenarios; binary classification of the pass and fail, three class
   scenarios, and four class scenarios. It was shown that ensemble methods
   combined with base learners of boosting and bagging significantly
   increase the accuracy for binary classification, slightly increase
   accuracy for three class problems, and have no significance in
   increasing the accuracy when the problem is 4 classes. The ensemble
   algorithm of bagging and boosting FDT achieved an accuracy of 98.25\%
   for binary classification and 89.47\% for three classes. The standard
   ensemble FDT achieved an accuracy of 77.19\% for four classes. The
   results obtained for binary classification were compared with results
   reported in the extant literature using the same dataset proving that
   the proposed modified algorithms achieved better results than similarly
   proposed methods. The three-class and four-class results could not be
   compared because according to the author's knowledge, there are no
   research papers published for the same dataset for multi-class
   classification.},

Abstract = {Modelling learning behaviors and predicting student performance in
   massive open online courses (MOOCs) are vital for adaptive course
   planning and personalized intervention. This study proposes a new
   approach for discovering time-embedded behavioral patterns in micro
   behaviors of MOOC learners and incorporating them as features for
   student profiling and learning performance prediction. We embedded
   discretized time intervals into interaction sequences and used n-gram
   extraction to output time-related behavioral patterns. With log data
   from a Python programming MOOC with 591 learners, we exploited
   exploration data analysis, unsupervised, and supervised learning to
   elucidate the associations between time-related behavioral patterns and
   academic performance. Nine out of seventeen targeted patterns are highly
   correlated with the final grade, in which, three patterns related to the
   help-seeking, evaluation, and study activities with short or medium
   intervals (less than two minutes) are strong predictors of academic
   performance in a very early stage. The time-related behavioral patterns
   also serve as good features for clustering learners into three groups
   based on learning behaviors: Sampling learners, Comprehensive learners,
   and Targeting learners. Our empirical results show the usability of the
   proposed time-embedded behavioral patterns in immediate diagnosis
   learners' engagement, raising new challenges for learning analytics with
   time concerning to achieve precision education.},

Abstract = {This study introduces data mining methods to accounting education
   scholarship to explore the relationship between accounting students'
   current academic performance (grades), demographic information,
   pre-university entrance scores and predicted academic performance. It
   adopts a C4.5 classification algorithm based on decision-tree analysis
   to examine 640 accounting students enrolled in an undergraduate
   accounting program at an Australian university. A significant
   contribution of this study is improved prediction of academic
   performance and identification of characteristics of students deemed to
   be at risk. By partitioning students into sub-groups based on tertiary
   entrance scores and employing clustering of study units, this study
   facilitates a more nuanced understanding of predictor attributes. Key
   findings were the dominance of a cluster of second year units in
   predicting students' later academic performance; that gender did not
   influence performance; and that performance in first year at university,
   rather than secondary school grades, was the most important predictor of
   subsequent academic performance.},

Abstract = {Recently, data mining approaches have been widely used to estimate
   student performance in online education. Various machine learning (ML)
   based data mining techniques have been developed to evaluate student
   performance accurately. However, they face specific issues in
   implementation. Hence, a novel hybrid Elman neural with apriori mining
   (ENAM) approach was presented in this article to predict student
   performance in online education. The designed model was validated with
   the student's performance dataset. Incorporating the Elman neural system
   eliminates the noise data present in dataset. Moreover, meaningful
   features are extracted in feature analysis and trained to the system.
   Then, the student performances are sorted based on their average score
   and classified as good, bad, or average. In addition, a case study was
   developed to describe the working of the designed model. The presented
   approach was executed in python software, and performance metrics are
   estimated. Moreover, a comparative analysis was performed to prove that
   the proposed system earned better outcomes than existing approaches.},

Title = {Predicting secondary school student performance using a double particle
   swarm optimization-based categorical boosting model},

Abstract = {Knowing the potential students who will fail the final exam at early
   stages is very challenging but important for the decision-makers in the
   educational institutions to take proper actions to prevent them from
   failure. To accurately predict the secondary school student performance,
   we propose a double particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based categorical
   boosting (P2CatBoost) model based on the demographic, school period
   grades, and social/school related features. Considering the machine
   learning models are sensitive to their hyper-parameter settings, we
   introduce the PSO to optimize the fitness function. In addition, the
   threshold of a standard binary classification task is 0.5, which might
   not be the optimal value in real-world applications. Thus, we optimize
   this threshold by the PSO. To evaluate the performance of our proposed
   model, two datasets downloaded from the University of California, Irvine
   Repository and the Kaggle, respectively, are used. The experimental
   results showed that our proposed P2CatBoost has the best performance in
   terms of all the metrics used. Our proposed P2CatBoost has the best
   accuracy of 96.62\% and 94.45\% for the final grade prediction of the
   Mathematics and Portuguese courses, respectively. In addition, our
   proposed model outperforms the other models under comparison from 4.5\%
   to 8.3\%. The statistical analyses verify that our P2CatBoost can
   significantly outperform the comparing models. These results confirm the
   effectiveness of our double PSO for improving the performance of student
   performance prediction, indicating our proposed model could be a useful
   tool in educational institutions to improve the quality of education.},

Title = {Explainable Machine Learning Prediction for the Academic Performance of
   Deaf Scholars},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Pages = {23595-23612},
Abstract = {Deaf and Hard of Hearing (DHH) students encounter obstacles in higher
   education due to language and communication challenges. Although
   research aims to improve their academic performance, the potential of
   Machine Learning (ML) remains underutilized in DHH education. The
   opacity of ML models further complicates their adoption. This study aims
   to fill this gap by developing a novel ML-based system with eXplainable
   AI (XAI), specifically utilizing Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic
   Explainer (LIME) and Shapley Additive Explainer (SHAP). The objective is
   twofold: predicting at-risk DHH students and explaining risk factors.
   Merging ML and XAI, this approach could positively impact DHH students'
   educational outcomes. A dataset of 454 records detailing DHH students is
   collected. To address dataset limitations, synthetic data and SMOTE are
   used. Students are categorized into three performance levels. The data
   is modeled with different ML models, transfer models, ensemble models,
   and combination models. Among the models, the stacked model with
   XGBoost, ExtraTrees, and Random Forest exhibited better performance with
   an accuracy of 92.99\%. Results highlight the model's significance,
   providing insights through XAI into crucial factors affecting academic
   performance, including communication mode, early intervention, schooling
   type, and family deafness history. LIME and SHAP values were found to be
   effective in deriving insights into DHH student performance prediction
   framework. Communication mode, notably, strongly influences at-risk
   students. The major contribution of this study is the development of a
   novel ML-based system and the XAI interpretations whose value lies in
   its social relevance, guiding stakeholders to enhance DHH scholars'
   academic achievements.},

Abstract = {This article addresses the problem of performance prediction in a
   flipped learning course on digital systems. The course is a part of a
   first-year Engineering degree offered at a public university. The extent
   to which failure at the end of the course can be anticipated is analyzed
   by examining the students' behavior related to academic activities. This
   prediction will be made by considering whether students perform
   different activities as instructed. The timeframe is also limited to the
   early stages of the course. Although anticipating results at early
   stages on the basis of behavioral aspects makes it possible to redress
   the behavior of at-risk students, at the same time, it also introduces
   limitations for potential models. As there are no assessments during the
   early period, no course activity grades will be available for modeling
   purposes. In this study, different data mining techniques will be used,
   which will offer better results. Results will be analyzed in terms of
   the performance of at-risk students and compared with previous research
   studies. Models will also provide information about factors of relevance
   for the academic success of the course.},

   especially within the United States. Currently, learning analytics (LA)
   and educational data mining (EDM) are purported by many educational
   companies and institutions to successfully improve learning through what
   are often considered as objective collection, classification, and
   analysis of educational data. Enthusiasm about big data in education has
   contributed to the naturalization of datafication within the field.
   Educational data is regarded as a natural resource that exists `out
   there' to be mined by EDM and refined by LA. Once refined, it is thought
   to bear the truth of educational assessment that leads to successful

Abstract = {Performance prediction is an important research facet of educational
   data mining. Most models extract student behavior features from campus
   card data for prediction. However, most of these methods have coarse
   time granularity, difficulty in extracting useful high-order behavior
   combination features, dependence on 6 historical achievements, etc. To
   solve these problems, this paper utilizes prediction of grade point
   average (GPA prediction) and whether a specific student has failing
   subjects (failing prediction) in a term as the goal of performance
   prediction and proposes a comprehensive performance prediction model of
   college students based on behavior features. First, a method for
   representing campus card data based on behavior flow is introduced to
   retain higher time accuracy. Second, a method for extracting student
   behavior features based on multi-head self-attention mechanism is
   proposed to automatically select more important high-order behavior
   combination features. Finally, a performance prediction model based on
   student behavior feature mode difference is proposed to improve the
   model's prediction accuracy and increases the model's robustness for
   students with significant changes in performance. The performance of the
   model is verified on actual data collected by the teaching monitoring
   big data platform of Xi'an Jiaotong University. The results show that
   the model's prediction performance is better than the comparison
   algorithms on both the failing prediction and GPA prediction.},

Abstract = {In the last few decades, technological improvements have had a
   considerable impact on education, much like many other fields of society
   and human endeavor. The applications of today's cutting-edge technology
   are numerous in education, but recently researchers focused on using
   these technologies, especially artificial intelligence (AI) and machine
   learning (ML), for students' performance prediction prior to the exam.
   It makes perfect sense to forecast student success to help all
   participants in the educational process. Student performance prediction
   may assist them in the selection of suitable courses and in creating
   their academic schedules. Keeping in mind the importance of student
   performance evaluation, this paper analyzes the prediction rate of
   college English level 4 by using one of the powerful ML algorithms
   called random forest (RF). RF uses numerous classifiers, or
   ``ensembles{''}, rather than just one classifier, and is based on the
   decision tree technique. To do this, we constructed input and output
   variables and collected data for these variables, including basic
   student information (gender, ethnicity, major), English scores on
   college admission exams, college English scores (total of four
   semesters), and extracurricular activities of college students.
   Preprocessing was performed on the collected data, which included the
   removal of unnecessary attributes, handling outliers, normalization, and
   data cleaning. After the preprocessing, the features were extracted and
   transformed into reduced dimensionality by the local-preserving
   projection (LPP) algorithm. From the extracted features, we selected
   only the most relevant in order to feed them as input to the RF model.
   The model is implemented in MATLAB in order to evaluate its performance.
   The efficiency of the proposed model is evaluated with the help of
   experiments in order to verify the effectiveness of the model. The
   performance of the RF algorithm-based college English IV pass rate
   prediction model is evaluated by computing the prediction accuracy,
   recall rate, and hit rate of the classification results. We achieved a
   prediction accuracy of 96.5\%, a recall rate of 89.5\%, and a hit rate
   of 93.3\%. The results show that the random RF-based prediction model
   for college English level 4 has a good classification effect and that
   the prediction results are more accurate.},

Abstract = {Educational institutions are creating a considerable amount of data
   regarding students, faculty and related organs. This data is an
   essential asset for academic institutions as it has valuable insights,
   knowledge and intelligence for the policymakers. Students are the
   fundamental entities and primary source of data creation in any
   educational environment. The educational institutions need to
   distinguish students who are weak in their studies and require special
   attention and monitoring to improve their learning behaviours, future
   academic performances and factors that can affect their interpretation.
   This paper adopted a hybrid classification model using Decision tree and
   support vector machine (SVM) algorithms to predict students' academic
   performance. We statistically analyzed and identified factors that can
   affect students' academic performance. The dataset used is collected
   from Bachelor students of the City University of Science and Information
   Technology (CUSIT). The experimental results revealed 71.79\%, 74.04\%
   and 78.85\% for decision tree, and 69.87\%, 74.04\% and 71.15\% accuracy
   for SVM models respectively for different splits. The study identified
   seven different factors that can directly affect the students'
   performance associated with educational institutions and social
   networks. Factors like ``time spent on social networks,{''} ``type of
   games playing on mobiles,{''} and ``time spent on playing mobile
   games{''} significantly affect students' performance.},

Title = {E-Learning Performance Prediction: Mining the Feature Space of Effective
   Learning Behavior},
Journal = {ENTROPY},
Year = {2022},

Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Learning analysis provides a new opportunity for the development of
   online education, and has received extensive attention from scholars at
   home and abroad. How to use data and models to predict learners'
   academic success or failure and give teaching feedback in a timely
   manner is a core problem in the field of learning analytics. At present,
   many scholars use key learning behaviors to improve the prediction
   effect by exploring the implicit relationship between learning behavior
   data and grades. At the same time, it is very important to explore the
   association between categories and prediction effects in learning
   behavior classification. This paper proposes a self-adaptive feature
   fusion strategy based on learning behavior classification, aiming to
   mine the effective E-learning behavior feature space and further improve
   the performance of the learning performance prediction model. First, a
   behavior classification model (E-learning Behavior Classification Model,
   EBC Model) based on interaction objects and learning process is
   constructed; second, the feature space is preliminarily reduced by
   entropy weight method and variance filtering method; finally, combined
   with EBC Model and a self-adaptive feature fusion strategy to build a
   learning performance predictor. The experiment uses the British Open
   University Learning Analysis Dataset (OULAD). Through the experimental
   analysis, an effective feature space is obtained, that is, the basic
   interactive behavior (BI) and knowledge interaction behavior (KI) of
   learning behavior category has the strongest correlation with learning
   performance.And it is proved that the self-adaptive feature fusion
   strategy proposed in this paper can effectively improve the performance
   of the learning performance predictor, and the performance index of
   accuracy(ACC), F1-score(F1) and kappa(K) reach 98.44\%, 0.9893, 0.9600.
   This study constructs E-learning performance predictors and mines the
   effective feature space from a new perspective, and provides some
   auxiliary references for online learners and managers.},

Abstract = {Educational Data Mining is widely used for predicting student's
   performance. It's a challenging task because a plethora of features
   related to demographics, personality traits, socio-economic, and
   environmental may affect students' performance. Such varying features
   may depend on the level of study, program offered, nature of subject,
   and geographical location. This study attempted to predict the final
   semester's results of students studying Doctor of Veterinary Medicine
   (DVM) based on their pre-admission academic achievements, demographics,
   and first semester performance. The imbalanced data led to non-generic
   prediction models, so it was addressed through synthetic minority
   oversampling technique. Among five prediction models, the Support Vector
   Machine led the best with 92\% accuracy. The decision tree model
   identified key features affecting students' performance. The analysis
   led to the conclusion that marks obtained in Biology, Islamiat, and Urdu
   at Matric and English at Intermediate level affected the students'
   performance in their final semester. The findings provide useful
   information to predict students' performance and guidelines for academic
   institutes' management regarding improving students' achievement. It is
   speculated that adoption of digital transformation may help reduce
   difficulty faced in data collection and analysis.},

Abstract = {Next-term grade prediction is a challenging problem. The objective of
   this problem is to predict students grades in new courses, given their
   grades in courses they have previously taken. Adopting various machine
   learning algorithms is a very common and straightforward approach to
   tackling this problem. However, such models are very difficult to
   interpret. That is, it is difficult to explain to a student (or a
   teacher) why the model predicted grade B for a given student for
   example. In this work, we shed light on the importance of building
   interpretable models for educational data mining tasks. Specifically, we
   propose a novel interpretable framework for multi-class grade prediction
   that is based on an optimal rule-list mining algorithm. Additionally, we
   evaluate our proposed framework on two private datasets and compare our
   results with baseline models. Our findings show that our proposed
   framework is capable of achieving higher prediction and interpretability
   values when compared to black-box models.},

Abstract = {The process of teaching and learning is the most powerful tool that
   teachers and professors have, because it is the main way that students
   change in the ways that teachers and professors want them to. TQM is
   recommended as a way to control, monitor, and improve the quality of
   teaching and learning strategies in the classroom. In line with the
   principles of TQM, evaluations of things like results and feedback are
   used to improve teaching and learning. The level of academic success
   that a program's students have may say a lot about how good that
   programme is. You can predict how well a student will do in school in
   the future by looking at how well they did in the past. After more
   research, it might be possible to find a link between the students'
   grades and their skills and interests. When teachers have this kind of
   information, they are better able to focus on the students who are
   having the most trouble. This article shows how to use feature selection
   and machine learning to improve the quality of teaching and learning in
   higher education by predicting how well a student will do in school. The
   performance of university students is used as an input to a
   classification model. First, ant colony optimization is used to choose
   the most important features. Then, KNN, Naive Bayes, and decision tree
   algorithms are used to classify the chosen data. Based on accuracy,
   recall, and F1 score, KNN performs better.},

Abstract = {The performance of student in the academic field reveals the
   consideration over researchers to enhance student's weakness. With the
   consumption of high potential factors from the dataset, accurate student
   performance prediction is carried out. Targeted projection pursuit
   similarity based attribute selection (TPPS-AS) technique is designed to
   improve the student academic performance prediction. TPPS is a machine
   learning technique that observes the given input. The relevant
   attributes from the multidimensional space is determined by TPPS.
   Several research works were recognized recently to conclude the high
   potential factors for observing student academic performances. A novel
   technique is designed in this research work to improve the student
   academic performance prediction in a taken dataset by choosing more
   relevant attributes. To detect the student academic performance with
   better accuracy and lesser time, proposed TPPS-AS technique is employed.
   The performance of student academic performance prediction is improved
   by TPPS-AS technique through the attribute selection with higher
   accuracy. With this proposed technique, prediction accuracy of the
   student academic performance is increased after the relevant attributes
   selection process.},

   approach with time series imaging},
Journal = {MULTIMEDIA TOOLS AND APPLICATIONS},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 NOV 23},
Abstract = {With the COVID-19 outbreak, schools and universities have massively
   adopted online learning to ensure the continuation of the learning
   process. However, in such setting, instructors lack efficient mechanisms
   to evaluate the learning gains and get insights about difficulties
   learners encounter. In this research work, we tackle the problem of
   predicting learner performance in online learning using a deep
   learning-based approach. Our proposed solution allows stakeholders
   involved in the online learning to anticipate the learner outcome ahead
   of the final assessment hence offering the opportunity for proactive
   measures to assist the learners. We propose a two-pathway deep learning
   model to classify learner performance using their interaction during the
   online sessions in the form of clickstreams. We also propose to
   transform these time series of clicks into images using the Gramian
   Angular Field. The learning model makes use of the available extra
   demographic and assessment information. We evaluate our approach on the
   Open University Learning Analytics Dataset. Comprehensive comparative
   study is conducted with evaluation against state-of-art approaches under
   different experimental settings. We also demonstrate the importance of
   including extra demographic and assessment data in the prediction
   process.},

Abstract = {educational outcomes across varied institutions like universities,
   schools, and training centers necessitates accurately predicting student
   performance. These systems aggregates the data from multiple
   sources-exam centers, virtual courses, registration departments, and
   e-learning platforms. Analyzing this complex and diverse educational
   data is a challenge, thus necessitating the application of machine
   learning techniques. Utilizing machine learning algorithms for
   dimensionality reduction simplifies intricate datasets, enabling more
   comprehensive analysis. Through machine learning, educational data is
   refined, uncovering valuable patterns and forecasts by simplifying
   complexities via feature selection and dimensionality reduction methods.
   This refinement significantly amplifies the efficacy of student
   performance prediction systems, empowering educators and institutions
   with data-driven insights and thereby enriching the overall educational
   landscape. In this particular research, the Decision Tree Classification
   (DTC) model is used for forecasting student performance. DTC stands out
   as a potent machine-learning method for classification purposes. Two
   optimization algorithms, namely the Fox Optimization (FO) and the Black
   Widow Optimization (BWO), are integrated to heighten the model's
   accuracy and efficiency further. The amalgamation of DTC with these
   pioneering optimization techniques underscores the study's dedication to
   harnessing the forefront of machine learning and bio-inspired
   algorithms, ensuring more precise and resilient predictions of student
   performance, ultimately culminating in improved educational outcomes.
   From the results garnered for G1 and G3, it is evident that the DTBW
   model demonstrated the most exceptional performance in both predicting
   and categorizing G1, achieving an Accuracy and Precision value of 93.7
   percent. Conversely, the DTFO model emerged as the most precise
   predictor for G3, achieving an Accuracy and Precision of 93.4 and 93.5
   percent, respectively, in the prediction task.},

Abstract = {In the era of big data, the traditional governance model of student
   behavior management gradually shows the disadvantage of ``post
   positioning{''}. Therefore, the research uses relevant data mining
   algorithms to extract and analyze students' behavior characteristics,
   and constructs a SPC system model for students' behavior analysis and
   performance prediction. At the same time, the experiment verifies its
   effectiveness. The experimental results show that in the factor
   analysis, the overall variance of the first seven indicators is
   69.942\%, which shows that there is a significant correlation between
   students' learning behavior and academic performance. In the model
   performance analysis of SPC system, the accuracy of the five algorithms
   is kept at 40\% - 60\%, while SVM has higher stability than other
   methods. In addition, the prediction accuracy and response rate of SPC
   model reached 86.90\% and 81.57\% respectively. When the sequence length
   was increased from 1 to 20, the accuracy of SPC model exceeded 70\%;
   However, when the feature dimension exceeds 50, the model representation
   ability will decline. Therefore, appropriate feature dimensions are
   needed to predict student performance. To sum up, the SPC model built by
   the research is effective in analyzing student behavior and predicting
   students' performance, and practical in actual student management.},

Title = {RETRACTED: Enhancement of Predicting Students Performance Model Using
   Ensemble Approaches and Educational Data Mining Techniques (Retracted

Abstract = {Student performance prediction is extremely important in today's
   educational system. Predicting student achievement in advance can assist
   students and teachers in keeping track of the student's progress. Today,
   several institutes have implemented a manual ongoing evaluation method.
   Students benefit from such methods since they help them improve their
   performance. In this study, we can use educational data mining (EDM),
   which we recommend as an ensemble classifier to anticipate the
   understudy accomplishment forecast model based on data mining techniques
   as classification techniques. This model uses distinct datasets which
   represent the student's intercommunication with the instructive model.
   The exhibition of an understudy's prescient model is evaluated by a kind
   of classifiers, for instance, logistic regression, naive Bayes tree,
   artificial neural network, support vector system, decision tree, random
   forest, and k-nearest neighbor. Additionally, we used set processes to
   evolve the presentation of these classifiers. We utilized Boosting,
   Random Forest, Bagging, and Voting Algorithms, which are the normal
   group of techniques used in studies. By using ensemble methods, we will
   have a good result that demonstrates the dependability of the proposed
   model. For better productivity, the various classifiers are gathered
   and, afterward, added to the ensemble method using the Vote procedure.
   The implementation results demonstrate that the bagging method
   accomplished a cleared enhancement with the DT model, where the DT
   algorithm accuracy with bagging increased from 90.4\% to 91.4\%. Recall
   results improved from 0.904 to 0.914. Precision results also increased
   from 0.905 to 0.915.},

Abstract = {The ability to predict students' academic performance is critical for
   any educational institution that aims to improve their students'
   learning process and achievement. Although students' performance
   prediction problem is studied widely, it still represents a challenge
   and complex issue for educational institutions due to the different
   features that affect students learning process and achievement in
   courses. Moreover, the utilization of web-based learning systems in
   education provides opportunities to study how students learning and what
   learning behavior leading them to success. The main objective of this
   research was to investigate the impact of assessment grades and online
   activity data in the Learning Management System (LMS) on students'
   academic performance. Based on one of the commonly used data mining
   techniques for prediction, called classification. Five classification
   algorithms were applied that decision tree, random forest, sequential
   minimal optimization, multilayer perceptron, and logistic regression.
   Experimental results revealed that assessment grades are the most
   important features affecting students' academic performance. Moreover,
   prediction models that included assessment grades alone or in
   combination with activity data perform better than models based on
   activity data alone. Also, random forest algorithm performs well for
   predicting student a cademic performance, followed by decision tree.},

Abstract = {Educational data mining is a process that aims at discovering patterns
   that provide insight into teaching and learning processes. This work
   uses Machine Learning techniques to create a student performance
   prediction model, using academic data and records from a Learning
   Management System, that correlates with success or failure in completing
   the course. Six algorithms were employed, with models trained at three
   different stages of their two-year course completion. We tested the
   models with records of 394 students from 3 courses. Random Forest
   provided the best results with 84.47\% on the F1 score in our
   experiments, followed by Decision Tree obtaining similar results in the
   first subjects. We also employ clustering techniques and find different
   behavior groups with a strong correlation to performance. This work
   contributes to predicting students at risk of dropping out, offers
   insight into understanding student behavior, and provides a support
   mechanism for academic managers to take corrective and preventive
   actions on this problem.},

Abstract = {Students' performance prediction systems play a vital role in enhancing
   the educational performance inside universities, schools, and training
   centers. Big data can come from different resources such as examination
   centers, virtual courses, registration departments, e-learning systems.
   Extracting meaningful knowledge from educational data is a complex task,
   so reducing the data dimensionality is needed. In this paper, we
   proposed an enhanced binary genetic algorithm (EBGA) as a wrapper
   feature selection algorithm. Novel hybrid selection mechanism based on a
   k-means algorithm and electromagnetic-like mechanism (EM) method is
   proposed. K-means will cluster the population into a set of clusters,
   while EM will determine a value called a total force (TF) for each
   solution. Each cluster has an accumulated total force (ATF) (i.e.,
   adding all TFs together). Selection process will select two solutions
   with the highest TF from the cluster, which has the highest ATF. We
   employed a hybrid machine learning approach between the proposed EBGA
   and five different classifiers (i.e., k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN),
   Decision Trees (DT), Naive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and
   Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)). Two real case studies obtained from
   UCI Machine Learning Repository are used in this paper. Obtained results
   showed the ability of the proposed approach to enhance the performance
   of the binary genetic algorithm. Moreover, the performances of all
   classifiers are improved between 1\% and 11\%.},

Abstract = {Predicting student performance is crucial in higher education, as it
   facilitates course selection and the development of appropriate future
   study plans. The process of supporting the instructors and supervisors
   in monitoring students in order to upkeep them and combine training
   programs to get the best outcomes. It decreases the official warning
   signs and inefficient students' expulsions. Therefore, analysis of
   students' performance on various academic tests is critical for future
   skill development. Despite the fact that existing performance prediction
   systems based on Deep Learning (DL) technologies such as Artificial
   Neural Networks (ANN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) have outperformed
   Machine Learning (ML) -based systems in the prediction task, there are
   still a few issues. Ignorance of relevant features, analysis limitations
   to the existing amount of data points, and ambiguity in student records
   are only a few of these issues. This research proposes a novel Student
   Academic Performance Predicting (SAPP) system to address these issues
   and enhance prediction accuracy. It has a better architecture that uses
   a combination of 4-layer stacked Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network,
   Random Forest (RF), and Gradient Boosting (GB) techniques to predict
   students' pass or fail outcomes. Additionally, the proposed SAPP system
   is compared to existing prediction systems using publicly accessible
   student OULAD dataset with an addition of self-curated emotional
   dataset. The performance of SAPP system is measured using Accuracy,
   Precision, F-measure, and Recall parameters. The results of proposed
   algorithm (LSTM + RF + B) is compared with LSTM + RF, LSTM + B and end
   to end DL models such as ANN, LSTM, RNN, Convolutional Neural Network
   (CNN) and most commonly utilized ML models in the literature such as

Abstract = {The plethora of changes that have taken place in policy formulations on
   higher education in recent years in Greece has led to unification, the
   abolition of departments or technological educational institutions (TEI)
   and mergers at universities. As a result, many students are required to
   complete their studies in departments of the abolished TEI. Dropout or a
   delay in graduation is a significant problem that results from newly
   joined students at the university, in addition to the provision of
   studies. There are various reasons for this, with student performance
   during studies being one of the major contributing factors. This study
   was aimed at predicting the time required for weak students to pass
   their courses so as to allow the university to develop strategic
   programs that will help them improve performance and graduate in time.
   This paper presents various components of educational data mining
   incorporating a new state-of-the-art strategy, called AutoML, which is
   used to find the best models and parameters and is capable of predicting
   the length of time required for students to pass their courses using
   their past course performance and academic information. A dataset of
   23,687 ``Computer Networking{''} module students was used to train and
   evaluate the classification of a model developed in the KNIME Analytics
   (open source) data science platform. The accuracy of the model was
   measured using well-known evaluation criteria, such as precision,
   recall, and F-measure. The model was applied to data related to three
   basic courses and correctly predicted approximately 92\% of students'
   performance and, specifically, students who are likely to drop out or
   experience a delay before graduating.},

Abstract = {Monitoring individual student academic performance is indispensable to
   educational institutes since they are required to provide evidence of
   their students' academic performance to diverse governmental bureaus.
   Machine learning classifiers appear productive tools for this purpose;
   however, instance-based machine learning classifiers have acquired the
   least consideration. This research measures the suitability of
   instance-based classifiers, exclusively k-Nearest Neighbours (k-NN) and
   Locally Weighted Learning (LWL), in the pedagogical environment and
   proposes solutions to issues related to this class of classifiers. The
   performance of these classifiers depends upon the number of nearest
   neighbours (k) and the distance metrics. We performed experiments, with
   varying values of k and different distance metrics, to evaluate the
   performance of k-NN and LWL. To authenticate the conclusions drawn from
   these experiments, we carried out experimental evaluation with 3 more
   datasets taken from another research. This comparison evidences the
   suitability of instancebased classifiers, in pedagogical environment,
   especially LWL which is one of the least addressed classifiers. The
   comparative analysis highlights the fact that varying value of k and
   changing the distance metric optimistically affect the classifier's
   performance. Even though Manhattan distance metric dominates in
   achieving higher accuracy; however, classifiers may act differently for
   dissimilar datasets. To resolve this shortfall, we propose a novel
   framework which carries out extensive experiments with varying value of
   k and changing distance metrics and conclude a prediction model which
   emerges appropriate for the provided training dataset. The framework
   takes training dataset from an instructor and recommends suitable
   instance-based learning prediction model.},

Abstract = {Over the past few years, the growing popularity of online education has
   enabled there to be a large amount of students' learning behavior data
   stored, which brings great opportunities and challenges to the field of
   educational data mining. Students' learning performance can be
   predicted, based on students' learning behavior data, so as to identify
   at-risk students who need timely help to complete their studies and
   improve students' learning performance and online teaching quality. In
   order to make full use of these learning behavior data, a new prediction
   method was designed based on existing research. This method constructs a
   hybrid deep learning model, which can simultaneously obtain the temporal
   behavior information and the overall behavior information from the
   learning behavior data, so that it can more accurately predict the
   high-risk students. When compared with existing deep learning methods,
   the experimental results show that the proposed method offers better
   predicting performance.},

   student performance results. The study suggests a general architecture
   for searching and recommending learning resources. It specifically
   proposes (1) the model of learning resource classification based on deep

   resources based on document similarity; (3) the model to predict
   learning performance using deep learning techniques including learning
   performance prediction model on all student data using CNN, another
   model on ability group using MLP, and the other model on per student

Title = {Students learning performance prediction based on feature extraction

Journal = {PLOS ONE},

Abstract = {With the development of information technology construction in schools,
   predicting student grades has become a hot area of application in
   current educational research. Using data mining to analyze the
   influencing factors of students' performance and predict their grades
   can help students identify their shortcomings, optimize teachers'
   teaching methods and enable parents to guide their children's progress.
   However, there are no models that can achieve satisfactory predictions
   for education-related public datasets, and most of these weakly
   correlated factors in the datasets can still adversely affect the
   predictive effect of the model. To solve this issue and provide
   effective policy recommendations for the modernization of education,
   this paper seeks to find the best grade prediction model based on data
   mining. Firstly, the study uses the Factor Analyze (FA) model to extract
   features from the original data and achieve dimension reduction. Then,
   the Bidirectional Gate Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) model and attention
   mechanism are utilized to predict grades. Lastly, Comparing the
   prediction results of ablation experiments and other single models, such
   as linear regression (LR), back propagation neural network (BP), random
   forest (RF), and Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU), the FA-BiGRU-attention model
   achieves the best prediction effect and performs equally well in
   different multi-step predictions. Previously, problems with students'
   grades were only detected when they had already appeared. However, the
   methods presented in this paper enable the prediction of students'
   learning in advance and the identification of factors affecting their
   grades. Therefore, this study has great potential to provide data
   support for the improvement of educational programs, transform the
   traditional education industry, and ensure the sustainable development
   of national talents.},

Abstract = {Knowledge tracing (KT) is the task of tracing students' evolving
   knowledge state during learning, which has improved the learning
   efficiency. To facilitate KT's development, most existing methods pursue
   high accuracy of student performance prediction but neglect the
   consistency between students' dynamic knowledge state with their
   learning process. Moreover, they focus on learning outcomes at a single
   learning interaction, while student progress at continuous learning
   interactions is more instructive. In this paper, we explore a new
   paradigm for the KT task and propose a novel model named Learning
   Process-consistent Knowledge Tracing (LPKT), which captures the
   evolution of students' knowledge state through monitoring their learning
   progress. Specifically, we utilize both the positive effect of the
   learning gain and the negative effect of forgetting in learning to
   calculate student progress in continuous learning interactions. Then,
   considering that the rate of progress is student-specific, we extend
   LPKT to LPKT-S by explicitly distinguishing the individual progress rate
   of each student. Extensive experimental results on three public datasets
   demonstrate that LPKT and LPKT-S could obtain more appropriate knowledge
   states in line with the learning process. Moreover, LPKT and LPKT-S
   outperform state-of-the-art KT methods on student performance
   prediction. Our work indicates a promising future research direction for
   KT, which is highly interpretable and accurate.},

Abstract = {In the profession of education, predicting students' academic success is
   an essential responsibility. This study introduces a novel methodology
   for predicting students' pass or fail outcome in certain courses. The
   system utilises academic, demographic, emotional, and VLE sequence
   information of students. Traditional prediction methods often struggle
   to capture the temporal dynamics inherent in student data, such as
   learning trajectories, study habits, and evolving performance patterns.
   In response, this research leverages Recurrent Neural Network (RNNs) and
   Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network (LSTMs), which are specifically
   designed to model sequences and long-term dependencies from OULAD and
   self-generated Emotional dataset. By incorporating these architectures,
   the proposed methodology excels in capturing the intricate relationships
   between various factors over time. Further, various ML models such as
   Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB) and
   Decision Tree (DT) are integrated with RNN + LSTM to enhance the
   predictive power of model. The proposed system with RNN + LSTM + RF
   techniques gained approximately 97\% accuracy that is comparatively
   higher than RNN + LSTM + SVM, RNN + LSTM + NB and RNN + LSTM + DT i.e.,
   90.67\%, 86.45\% \& 84.42\% respectively.},

Title = {A Fuzzy Model for Reasoning and Predicting Student's Academic
   Performance},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},

Abstract = {Evaluating students' academic performance is crucial for assessing the
   quality of education and educational strategies. However, it can be
   challenging to predict and evaluate academic performance under uncertain
   and imprecise conditions. To address this issue, many research works
   have employed fuzzy concepts to analyze, predict, and make decisions
   about students' academic performance. This paper investigates the use of
   fuzzy concepts in research related to evaluating, analyzing, predicting,
   or making decisions about student academic performance. The paper
   proposes a fuzzy model, called FPM (Fuzzy Propositional Model), for
   reasoning and predicting students' academic performance. FPM aims to
   address the limitations of previous studies by incorporating
   propositional logic with fuzzy sets concept, which allows for the
   representation of uncertainty and imprecision in the data. FPM
   integrates and transforms if-then rules into weighted fuzzy production
   rules to predict and evaluate academic performance. This paper tests and
   evaluates the FPM in two scenarios. In the first scenario, the model
   predicts and examines the impact of absenteeism on academic performance
   where there is no clear relation between the two parts of the dataset.
   In the second scenario, the model predicts the final exam results using
   the lab exam results, where the data are more related. The FPM provides
   good results in both scenarios, demonstrating its effectiveness in
   predicting and evaluating students' academic performance. A comparison
   study of the FPM's results with a linear regression model and previous
   work showed that the FPM performs better in predicting academic
   performance and provides more insights into the underlying factors
   affecting it. Therefore, the FPM could be useful in educational
   institutions to predict and evaluate students' academic performance,
   identify underlying factors affecting it, and improve educational
   strategies.},

Title = {Artificial intelligence to predict pre-clinical dental student academic
   performance based on pre-university results: A preliminary study},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF DENTAL EDUCATION},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JUL 30},
Abstract = {Purpose/ObjectivesAdmission into dental school involves selecting
   applicants for successful completion of the course. This study aimed to
   predict the academic performance of Kulliyyah of Dentistry,
   International Islamic University Malaysia pre-clinical dental students
   based on admission results using artificial intelligence machine
   learning (ML) models, and Pearson correlation coefficient
   (PCC).MethodsML algorithms logistic regression (LR), decision tree (DT),
   random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) models were
   applied. Academic performance prediction in pre-clinical years was made
   using three input parameters: age during admission, pre-university
   Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA), and total matriculation semester.
   PCC was deployed to identify the correlation between pre-university CGPA
   and dental school grades. The proposed models' classification accuracy
   ranged from 29\% to 57\%, ranked from highest to lowest as follows: RF,
   SVM, DT, and LR. Pre-university CGPA was shown to be predictive of
   dental students' academic performance; however, alone they did not yield
   optimal outcomes. RF was the most precise algorithm for predicting
   grades A, B, and C, followed by LR, DT, and SVM. In forecasting failure,
   LR predicted three grades with the highest recall, SVM predicted two
   grades, and DT predicted one. RF performance was
   insignificant.ConclusionThe findings demonstrated the application of ML
   algorithms and PCC to predict dental students' academic performance.
   However, it was limited by several factors. Each algorithm has unique
   performance qualities, and trade-offs between different performance
   metrics may be necessary. No definitive model stood out as the best
   algorithm for predicting student academic success in this study.},

Abstract = {The explosive increase in educational data and information systems has
   led to new teaching practices, challenges, and learning processes. To
   effectively manage and analyze this information, it is crucial to adopt
   innovative methodologies and techniques. Recommender systems (RSs) offer
   a solution for advising students and guiding their learning journeys by
   utilizing statistical methods such as machine learning (ML) and graph
   analysis to analyze program and student data. This paper introduces an
   RS for advisors and students that analyzes student records to develop
   personalized study plans over multiple semesters. The proposed system
   integrates ideas from graph theory, performance modeling, ML,
   explainable recommendations, and an intuitive user interface. The system
   implicitly implements many academic rules through network analysis.
   Accordingly, a systematic and comprehensive review of different
   students' plans was possible using metrics developed in the mathematical
   graph theory. The proposed system systematically assesses and measures
   the relevance of a particular student's study plan. Experiments on
   datasets collected at the University of Dubai show that the model
   presented in this study outperforms similar ML-based solutions in terms
   of different metrics. Typically, up to 86\% accuracy and recall have
   been achieved. Additionally, the lowest mean square regression (MSR)
   rate of 0.14 has been attained compared to other state-of-the-art
   regressors.},

Title = {A Hybrid Feature Selection Framework for Predicting Students Performance},

Abstract = {Student performance prediction helps the educational stakeholders to
   take proactive decisions and make interventions, for the improvement of
   quality of education and to meet the dynamic needs of society. The
   selection of features for student's performance prediction not only
   plays significant role in increasing prediction accuracy, but also helps
   in building the strategic plans for the improvement of students'
   academic performance. There are different feature selection algorithms
   for predicting the performance of students, however the studies reported
   in the literature claim that there are different pros and cons of
   existing feature selection algorithms in selection of optimal features.
   In this paper, a hybrid feature selection framework (using
   feature-fusion) is designed to identify the significant features and
   associated features with target class, to predict the performance of
   students. The main goal of the proposed hybrid feature selection is not
   only to improve the prediction accuracy, but also to identify optimal
   features for building productive strategies for the improvement in
   students' academic performance. The key difference between proposed
   hybrid feature selection framework and existing hybrid feature selection
   framework, is two level feature fusion technique, with the utilization
   of cosine-based fusion. Whereas, according to the results reported in
   existing literature, cosine similarity is considered as the best
   similarity measure among existing similarity measures. The proposed
   hybrid feature selection is validated on four benchmark datasets with
   variations in number of features and number of instances. The validated
   results confirm that the proposed hybrid feature selection framework
   performs better than the existing hybrid feature selection framework,
   existing feature selection algorithms in terms of accuracy, f-measure,
   recall, and precision. Results reported in presented paper show that the
   proposed approach gives more than 90\% accuracy on benchmark dataset
   that is better than the results of existing approach.},

Abstract = {Prediction models that underlie ``early warning systems{''} need
   improvement. Some predict outcomes using entrenched, unchangeable
   characteristics (e.g., socioeconomic status) and others rely on
   performance on early assignments to predict the final grades to which
   they contribute. Behavioral predictors of learning outcomes often accrue
   slowly, to the point that time needed to produce accurate predictions
   leaves little time for intervention. We aimed to improve on these
   methods by testing whether we could predict performance in a large
   lecture course using only students' digital behaviors in weeks prior to
   the first exam. Early prediction based only on malleable behaviors
   provides time and opportunity to advise students on ways to alter study
   and improve performance. Thereafter, we took the not-yet-common step of
   applying this model and testing whether providing digital learning
   support to those predicted to perform poorly can improve their
   achievement. Using learning management system log data, we tested models
   composed of theory-aligned behaviors using multiple algorithms and
   obtained a model that accurately predicted poor grades. Our algorithm
   correctly identified 75\% of students who failed to earn the grade of B
   or better needed to advance to the next course. We applied this model
   the next semester to predict achievement levels and provided a digital
   learning strategy intervention to students predicted to perform poorly.
   Those who accessed advice outperformed classmates on subsequent exams,
   and more students who accessed the advice achieved the B needed to move
   forward in their major than those who did not access advice.},

Abstract = {In this article, student video visualization profiles are analyzed with
   two objectives: 1) to identify difficult sections in videos and 2) to
   predict student performance based on their video visualization profiles.
   For identifying critical sections in videos two novel indicators are
   proposed. The first one is designed to measure the complexity of the
   concept being described. The second proposal, identifies video sections
   that are more visually complex. For the first indicator, the average
   number of forward and backward passes are used. The higher the number of
   backward (forward) passes over a region, the more challenging (easy) the
   section is. For identifying sections with complex visuals, the number of
   pauses is recorded. Finally, the student performance prediction is
   carried out with the purpose of detecting the alignment between videos
   and their related questions. The results show that video visualization
   profiles are a good tool to identify video and question alignment.},

Title = {Construction of Correlation Analysis Model of College Students' Sports
   Performance Based on Convolutional Neural Network},
Journal = {COMPUTATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AND NEUROSCIENCE},
Year = {2022},

Month = {MAY 27},
Abstract = {This paper proposes a network model recurrent fully connected network
   (RFC-Net) based on recurrent full convolution and polarization change.
   RFC-Net enriches the network by reconstructing and fine-tuning the fully
   convolutional network and adding recurrent convolutions to it. By
   studying the data mining technology of multidimensional association
   rules, based on the existing algorithms, this paper improves the
   shortcomings of the algorithms and realizes an efficient and practical
   method for data mining based on interdimensional multidimensional
   association rules. On the basis of mastering the actual student
   information, the effectiveness of the method is tested, and an
   employment analysis system based on association rules is established.
   Aiming at the fact that traditional grade prediction methods ignore the
   different influences of different behavioral characteristics on grades,
   and considering that behavioral data in different periods have different
   influences on student grades, the grade prediction problem is abstracted
   into a time series classification problem. The mechanism is combined
   with long short-term memory neural network to construct a performance
   prediction model based on Attention-BiLSTM. Experiments show that the
   prediction model proposed in this paper improves the accuracy and
   effectively improves the prediction quality compared with the logistic
   regression model with a better prediction effect in the traditional
   benchmark model and the long short-term memory neural network model
   without the introduction of the attention mechanism. Research shows that
   physical performance and academic performance are not contradictory. We
   must face up to the status of physical exercise in schools; as long as
   physical exercise is properly arranged, it can inspire students to form
   a spirit of unity, interaction, positivity, and perseverance in cultural
   studies.},

Abstract = {The current traditional college psychology courses only pay attention to
   the prevention and correction of the psychological problems of college
   students, but neglect to let students have a good positive emotion to
   learn, which is not conducive to the development of psychological
   potential of students, thus psychology learning cannot achieve the
   expected results. Based on the psychology blended teaching theory,
   combined with the entrepreneurial education of college students, a set
   of PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Action) teaching mode which adapts to the
   development needs of ``Internet education{''} is designed, and formed
   several new methods of teaching, such as ``integration of online and
   offline classroom teaching{''}. In addition, a new performance
   prediction model based on graph convolution neural network is proposed
   decision tree data mining methods are used to predict student
   performance, by extracting user information and high-dimensional
   information of the knowledge graph, this mode is conducive to platform
   managers to understand students' conditions in time and improve teaching
   quality. This teaching mode dynamically analyzes the internal
   relationships among learners, teachers, online classrooms, offline
   classrooms and it can find problems early and provide solutions. It is
   conducive to improving students' academic performance and learning
   enthusiasm, and enhancing the ability of college students.},

Abstract = {Stress is correlated with various illnesses that include diabetes,
   depression, and other chronic diseases and plays an important role in
   the emotional and physical well-being. In past years, number of student
   dropout from educational institute is rapidly maximizing. However, high
   rate of student dropout has been a major issue in various institutions.
   Dropout and stress prediction has received more attention in recent
   years. Previous literature studies applied machine learning algorithms
   to recognize the dropout and stress level of students, but there exist
   an issue of low accuracy and it leads to misidentification at learners.
   To overcome such problems and to create more accurate prediction result,
   a proposed method named Adaptive Chicken Squirrel Search Algorithm on
   the basis of Deep Belief Network (Adaptive-CSSA based DBN) is developed
   to predict the dropout and stress level of students based on the student
   performance behavior. The proposed prediction mechanism is designed with
   MapReduce framework by considering the mapper and the reducer functions.
   Here, the feature selection strategy is employed to select the unique
   features from student data that contains detailed information of
   students. Moreover, the proposed technique attained minimum MSE, RMSE,
   and MAPE as 0.025, 0.157, and 0.126 for dropout prediction and obtained
   lower MSE, RMSE, and MAPE value of 0.150, 0.387, and 0.326 for stress
   level prediction with student performance dataset.},
