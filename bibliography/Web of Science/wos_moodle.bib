Abstract = {Learners are expected to stay wakeful and focused while interacting with
   e-learning platforms. Although wakefulness of learners strongly relates
   to educational outcomes, detecting drowsy learning behaviors only from
   log data is not an easy task. In this study, we describe the results of
   our research to model learners' wakefulness based on multimodal data
   generated from heart rate, seat pressure, and face recognition. We
   collected multimodal data from learners in a blended course of
   informatics and conducted two types of analysis on them. First, we
   clustered features based on learners' wakefulness labels as generated by
   human raters and ran a statistical analysis. This analysis helped us
   generate insights from multimodal data that can be used to inform
   learner and teacher feedback in multimodal learning analytics. Second,
   we trained machine learning models with multiclass-Support Vector
   Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF) and CatBoost Classifier (CatBoost)
   algorithms to recognize learners' wakefulness states automatically. We
   achieved an average macro-F1 score of 0.82 in automated user-dependent
   models with CatBoost. We also showed that compared to unimodal data from
   each sensor, the multimodal sensor data can improve the accuracy of
   models predicting the wakefulness states of learners while they are
   interacting with e-learning platforms.},

Title = {Predicting Student Performance Using Clickstream Data and Machine
   Learning},
Journal = {EDUCATION SCIENCES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Student performance predictive analysis has played a vital role in
   education in recent years. It allows for the understanding students'
   learning behaviours, the identification of at-risk students, and the
   development of insights into teaching and learning improvement.
   Recently, many researchers have used data collected from Learning
   Management Systems to predict student performance. This study
   investigates the potential of clickstream data for this purpose. A total
   of 5341 sample students and their click behaviour data from the OULAD
   (Open University Learning Analytics Dataset) are used. The raw
   clickstream data are transformed, integrating the time and activity
   dimensions of students' click actions. Two feature sets are extracted,
   indicating the number of clicks on 12 learning sites based on weekly and
   monthly time intervals. For both feature sets, the experiments are
   performed to compare deep learning algorithms (including LSTM and
   1D-CNN) with traditional machine learning approaches. It is found that
   the LSTM algorithm outperformed other approaches on a range of
   evaluation metrics, with up to 90.25\% accuracy. Four out of twelve
   learning sites (content, subpage, homepage, quiz) are identified as
   critical in influencing student performance in the course. The insights
   from these critical learning sites can inform the design of future
   courses and teaching interventions to support at-risk students.},

Abstract = {Learning analytics aims at helping the students to attain their learning
   goals. The predictions in learning analytics are made to enhance the
   effectiveness of educational interferences. This study predicts student
   engagement at an early phase of a Virtual Learning Environment (VLE)
   course by analyzing data collected from consecutive years. The
   prediction model is developed using machine learning techniques applied
   to a subset of Open University Learning Analytics Dataset, provided by
   Open University (OU), Britain. The investigated data belongs to 7,775
   students who attended social science courses for consecutive assessment
   years. The experiments are conducted with a reduced feature set to
   predict whether the students are highly or lowly engaged in the courses.
   The attributes indicating students' interaction with the VLE, their
   scores, and final results are the most contributing variables for the
   predictive analysis. Based on these variables, a reduced feature vector
   is constructed. The baseline used in the study is the linear regression
   model. The model's best results showed 95\% accurate, 95\% precise, and
   98\% relevant results with the Random Forest classification algorithm.
   Early prediction's relevant features are a subset of click activities,
   which provided a functional interface between the students and the VLE.},

Abstract = {Educational Data Science has meant an important advancement in the
   understanding and improvemen of learning models in recent years. One of
   the most relevant research topics is student performance prediction
   through click-stream activity in virtual learning environments, which
   provide abundant information about their behaviour during the course.
   This work explores the potential of Deep Learning and Meta-Learning in
   this field, which has thus far been explored very little, so that it can
   serve as a basis for future studies. We implemented a predictive model
   which is able to automatically optimise the architecture and
   hyperparameters of a deep neural network, taking as a use case an
   educational dataset that contains information from more than 500
   students from an online university master's degree. The results show
   that the performance of the autonomous model was similar to the
   traditionally designed one, which offers significant benefits in terms
   of efficiency and scalability. This also opens up interesting areas of
   research related to Meta-Learning applied to educational Big Data.},

Abstract = {E-learning platforms have become increasingly popular across various
   industries, with higher education institutions being among the primary
   adopters. Learning management sys-tems (LMSs) have emerged as valuable
   tools that facilitate the management of learning and training processes
   while providing support for learning administration. However, LMS
   plat-forms often offer limited functionality for monitoring students'
   instructional progress, which is essential for understanding how
   learners interact with courses and materials. As a result, identifying
   at-risk students, tracking their progress, and intervening when
   necessary can be challenging. The substantial amount of data generated
   by LMS platforms can be transformed into meaningful indicators that
   allow for monitoring learners' progress and enhancing their
   self-regulation. Our research project focuses on developing a set of
   pedagogical indicators using learning analytics to monitor students'
   progress. We present a case study where we tracked and monitored the
   progress of students in the Web Technologies course on the e-campus
   platform at Cadi Ayyad University (Morocco), using a set of student
   performance indicators (SPIs). The findings of this study suggest that
   employing SPIs can help faculty mem- bers identify underperforming
   students, project their progress, and anticipate those at risk,
   ultimately enabling them to provide timely interventions to support
   learners' progress.},

Abstract = {Today, educational institutions produce large amounts of data with the
   deployment of learning management systems. These large datasets provide
   an untapped potential to support and enhance decision-making and
   operations. In recent times, machine learning (ML) has been applied to
   develop models utilizing this ``big{''} data to assist in
   decision-making. This study presents a systematic literature review into
   the application of ML to predict student performance. A total of 162
   research articles from January 2010 to October 2022 were critically
   reviewed and analyzed by applying Kitchenham's systematic literature
   review approach. Our analysis categorized the literature predicting
   students' academic performance into two categories: (i) predicting
   student performance in assessments, courses or programs, and identifying
   students at-risk of failing their course/program (129 studies); and (ii)
   predicting student dropout or retention in a course or program (33
   studies). Classification is the most commonly used approach for
   predicting student performance (138 studies), followed by regression (25
   studies) and clustering (9 studies). Supervised learning methods are
   used more often than semi-supervised learning. Five most popular ML
   algorithms include the Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes,
   Artificial Neural Network, and Support Vector Machine. Historical
   records of students' grades and class performance, academic related data
   from learning management systems, and students' demographics are the
   most common features used for predicting students' performance. The most
   common methods used for feature selection are Information Gain-based
   selection algorithms, Correlation-based feature selection, and Gain
   Ratio. The general platforms/tools/libraries used in the studies include
   WEKA, Python, R, Rapid Miner, and MATLAB. We also investigated possible
   actions considered in the literature to help at-risk students. We only
   found very few studies that deployed remedial actions and evaluated
   their impact on students' performance. In conclusion, ML has shown great
   potential in the prediction of student performance, but also has many
   areas of further research.},

Abstract = {In recent years, the application of data mining techniques on
   educational data has grown in importance. Educational data mining can be
   used to find hidden patterns in students' academic conduct and predict
   future success by examining previous data. Because more technical tools
   are being used to enhance the learning environment, including learning
   management systems (LMS), the importance of educational data mining is
   growing for educational institutions. The purpose of this study is to
   employ data mining techniques to analyse pupil behaviour patterns and
   predict how well they would perform academically. According to the
   findings of this study, there is a considerable correlation between
   student performance and a number of different factors, such as resource
   (page) views, activity gaps, grades from the previous semester, grades
   from prerequisite courses, and evaluations of first-term tests. Teachers
   and educators can use this study to spot students who need extra
   assistance so they can intervene.},

Abstract = {Learning analytics is an emerging technique of analysing student
   participation and engagement. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has
   significantly increased the role of learning management systems (LMSs).
   LMSs previously only complemented face-to-face teaching, something which
   has not been possible between 2019 to 2020. To date, the existing body
   of literature on LMSs has not analysed learning in the context of the
   pandemic, where an LMS serves as the only interface between students and
   instructors. Consequently, productive results will remain elusive if the
   key factors that contribute towards engaging students in learning are
   not first identified. Therefore, this study aimed to perform an
   extensive literature review with which to design and develop a student
   engagement model for holistic involvement in an LMS. The required data
   was collected from an LMS that is currently utilised by a local
   Malaysian university. The model was validated by a panel of experts as
   well as discussions with students. It is our hope that the result of
   this study will help other institutions of higher learning determine
   factors of low engagement in their respective LMSs.},

Abstract = {Digital advances in the learning space have changed the contours of
   student engagement as well as how it is measured. Learning management
   systems and other learning technologies now provide information about
   student behaviors with course materials in the form of learning
   analytics. In the context of a large, integrated and interdisciplinary
   Core curriculum course in a graduate school of public health, this study
   undertook a pilot randomized controlled trial testing the effect of
   providing a ``behavioral nudge{''} in the form of digital images
   containing specific information derived from learning analytics about
   past student behaviors and performance. The study found that student
   engagement varied significantly from week to week, but nudges linking
   coursework completion to assessment grade performance did not
   significantly change student engagement. While the a priori hypotheses
   of this pilot trial were not upheld, this study yielded significant
   findings that can guide future efforts to increase student engagement.
   Future work should include a robust qualitative assessment of student
   motivations, testing of nudges that tap into these motivations and a
   richer examination of student learning behaviors over time using
   stochastic analyses of data from the learning management system.},

Abstract = {We use a randomised experiment to study the effect of offering half of

   progress in the learning management systems, their predicted chance of
   passing, their predicted grade and their online intermediate performance
   compared with the total cohort. The email with dashboard access, as well
   as dashboard use, has positive effects on student behaviour in the
   online environment, but no effects are found on student performance in
   the final exam of the programming course. However, we do find
   differential effects by specialisation and student characteristics.},

Title = {ANN-LSTM: A deep learning model for early student performance prediction
   in MOOC},
Journal = {HELIYON},

Abstract = {Learning Analytics aims to discover the class of students' performance
   over time. This helps in-structors make in-time interventions but,
   discovering the students' performance class in virtual learning
   environments consider a challenge due to distance constraints. Many
   studies, which applied to Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) datasets,
   built predictive models but, these models were applied to specific
   courses and students and classify students into binary classes.
   Moreover, their results were obtained at the end of the course period
   thus delaying making in -time interventions. To bridge this gap, this
   study proposes a day-wise multi-class model to pre-dict students'
   performance using Artificial Neural Network and Long Short-Term Memory,
   named ANN-LSTM. To check the validity of this model, two baseline
   models, the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Gated Recurrent Unit
   (GRU), were conducted and compared with ANN-LSTM in this context.
   Additionally, the results of ANN-LSTM were compared with the
   state-of-the-art models in terms of accuracy. The results show that the
   ANN-LSTM model obtained the best re-sults among baseline models. The
   accuracy obtained by ANN-LSTM was about 70\% at the end of the third
   month of the course and outperforms RNN and GRU models which obtained
   53\% and 57\%, respectively. Also, the ANN-LSTM model obtained the best
   accuracy results with enhancement rates of about 6-14\% when compared
   with state-of-the-art models. This highlights the ability of LSTM as a
   time series model to make early predictions for student performance in
   MOOC taking benefit of its architecture and ability to keep latent
   dependencies.},

Abstract = {Predicting student performance automatically is of utmost importance,
   due to the substantial volume of data within educational databases.
   Educational data mining (EDM) devises techniques to uncover insights
   from data originating in educational settings. Artificial intelligence
   (AI) can mine educational data to predict student performance and
   provide measures to help students avoid failing and learn better.
   Learning platforms complement traditional learning settings by analyzing
   student performance, which can help reduce the chance of student
   failure. Existing methods for student performance prediction in
   educational data mining faced challenges such as limited accuracy,
   imbalanced data, and difficulties in feature engineering. These issues
   hindered effective adaptability and generalization across diverse
   educational contexts. This study proposes a machine learning-based
   system with deep convoluted features for the prediction of students'
   academic performance. The proposed framework is employed to predict
   student academic performance using balanced as well as, imbalanced
   datasets using the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). In
   addition, the performance is also evaluated using the original and deep
   convoluted features. Experimental results indicate that the use of deep
   convoluted features provides improved prediction accuracy compared to
   original features. Results obtained using the extra tree classifier with
   convoluted features show the highest classification accuracy of 99.9\%.
   In comparison with the state-of-the-art approaches, the proposed
   approach achieved higher performance. This research introduces a
   powerful AI-driven system for student performance prediction, offering
   substantial advancements in accuracy compared to existing approaches.},

Abstract = {Higher education institutes are increasingly turning their attention to
   web-based learning management systems. The purpose of this study is to
   investigate whether data collected from LMS can be used to predict
   student performance in classrooms that use LMS to supplement
   face-to-face teaching. Data was collected from eight courses spread
   across two semesters at a private university in Lebanon. Event history
   analysis was used to investigate whether the probability of logging in
   was related to the gender and grade of the students. Results indicate
   that students with higher grades login more frequently to the LMS, that
   females login more frequently than males, and that student login
   activity increases as the semester progresses. As a result, this study
   shows that login activity can be used to predict the academic
   performance of students. These findings suggest that educators in
   traditional face-to-face classes can benefit from educational data
   mining techniques that are applied to the data collected by learning
   management systems in order to monitor student performance.},

Abstract = {Education is crucial for a productive life and providing necessary
   resources. With the advent of technology like artificial intelligence,
   higher education institutions are incorporating technology into
   traditional teaching methods. Predicting academic success has gained
   interest in education as a strong academic record improves a
   university's ranking and increases student employment opportunities.
   Modern learning institutions face challenges in analyzing performance,
   providing high-quality education, formulating strategies for evaluating
   students' performance, and identifying future needs. E-learning is a
   rapidly growing and advanced form of education, where students enroll in
   online courses. Platforms like Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS),
   learning management systems (LMS), and massive open online courses
   (MOOC) use educational data mining (EDM) to develop automatic grading
   systems, recommenders, and adaptative systems. However, e-learning is
   still considered a challenging learning environment due to the lack of
   direct interaction between students and course instructors. Machine
   learning (ML) is used in developing adaptive intelligent systems that
   can perform complex tasks beyond human abilities. Some areas of
   applications of ML algorithms include cluster analysis, pattern
   recognition, image processing, natural language processing, and medical
   diagnostics. In this research work, K-means, a clustering data mining
   technique using Davies' Bouldin method, obtains clusters to find
   important features affecting students' performance. The study found that
   the SVM algorithm had the best prediction results after parameter
   adjustment, with a 96\% accuracy rate. In this paper, the researchers
   have examined the functions of the Support Vector Machine, Decision
   Tree, naive Bayes, and KNN classifiers. The outcomes of parameter
   adjustment greatly increased the accuracy of the four prediction models.
   Na \& iuml;ve Bayes model's prediction accuracy is the lowest when
   compared to other prediction methods, as it assumes a strong independent
   relationship between features.},

Title = {A Learning Analytics Theoretical Framework for STEM Education Virtual
   Reality Applications},
Journal = {EDUCATION SCIENCES},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {10},
Number = {11},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {While virtual reality has attracted educators' interest by providing new
   opportunities to the learning process and assessment in different
   science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) subjects, the
   results from previous studies indicate that there is still much work to
   be done when large data collection and analysis is considered. At the
   same time, learning analytics emerged with the promise to revolutionise
   the traditional practices by introducing new ways to systematically
   assess and improve the effectiveness of instruction. However, the
   collection of `big' educational data is mostly associated with web-based
   platforms (i.e., learning management systems) as they offer direct
   access to students' data with minimal effort. Thence, in the context of
   this work, we present a four-dimensional theoretical framework for
   virtual reality-supported instruction and propose a set of structural
   elements that can be utilised in conjunction with a learning analytics
   prototype system. The outcomes of this work are expected to support
   practitioners on how to maximise the potential of their interventions
   and provide further inspiration for the development of new ones.},

Abstract = {To capture and code as much as possible of student behavior and
   environment to apply learning analytics in conventional classrooms,
   patterns among successful inputs of existing online learning / learning
   management systems can be identified, to find existing but uncaptured
   classroom data. The goal of this review is to suggest proposals on
   expanded use of learning analytics in traditional classrooms. Predictors
   from learning models used in online learning can be applied to the
   traditional classroom and analogues may be found for unavailable
   predictors. Approaches used in developing these predictors can be used
   to develop predictors for conventional classrooms. Existing data can be
   used, or data that is convenient may be captured, with emphasis on
   approaches that work on smaller groups, where training of individual
   models should be attempted. The data collected should be simple to
   obtain, support the users otherwise, or have provable benefits.},

Month = {JAN 25},
Abstract = {Prior to the emergence of Big Data and technologies such as Learning
   Analytics (LA), classroom research focused mainly on measuring learning
   outcomes of a small sample through tests. Research on online
   environments shows that learners' engagement is a critical precondition
   for successful learning and lack of engagement is associated with
   failure and dropout. LA helps instructors to track, measure and
   visualize students' online behavior and use such digital traces to
   improve instruction and provide individualized support, i.e., feedback.
   This paper examines 1) metrics or indicators of learners' engagement as
   extracted and displayed by LA, 2) their relationship with academic
   achievement and performance, and 3) some freely available LA tools for
   instructors and their usability. The paper concludes with making
   recommendations for practice and further research by considering
   challenges associated with using LA in classrooms.},

Abstract = {As universities around the world have begun to use learning management
   systems (LMSs), more learning data have become available to gain deeper
   insights into students' learning processes and make data-driven
   decisions to improve student learning. With the availability of rich
   data extracted from the LMS, researchers have turned much of their
   attention to learning analytics (LA) applications using educational data
   mining techniques. Numerous LA models have been proposed to predict
   student achievement in university courses. To design predictive LA
   models, researchers often follow a data-driven approach that prioritizes
   prediction accuracy while sacrificing theoretical links to learning
   theory and its pedagogical implications. In this study, we argue that
   instead of complex variables (e.g., event logs, clickstream data,
   timestamps of learning activities), data extracted from online formative
   assessments should be the starting point for building predictive LA
   models. Using the LMS data from multiple offerings of an asynchronous
   undergraduate course, we analysed the utility of online formative
   assessments in predicting students' final course performance. Our
   findings showed that the features extracted from online formative
   assessments (e.g., completion, timestamps and scores) served as strong
   and significant predictors of students' final course performance. Scores
   from online formative assessments were consistently the strongest
   predictor of student performance across the three sections of the
   course. The number of clicks in the LMS and the time difference between
   first access and due dates of formative assessments were also
   significant predictors. Overall, our findings emphasize the need for
   online formative assessments to build predictive LA models informed by
   theory and learning design. Practitioner notes What is already known
   about this topic Higher education institutions often use learning
   analytics for the early identification of low-performing students or
   students at risk of dropping out. Most predictive models in learning
   analytics rely on immutable student characteristics (e.g., gender, race
   and socioeconomic status) and complex variables extracted from log data
   within a learning management system. Prioritizing prediction accuracy
   without theory orientation often yields ``black-box{''} models that fail
   to inform educators on what remedies need to be taken to improve student
   learning. What this paper adds Predictive models in learning analytics
   should consider learning theory, pedagogy and learning design to
   identify key predictors of student learning. Online formative
   assessments can be a starting point for building predictive models that
   are not only accurate but also provide educators with actionable
   insights on how student learning can be improved. Time-related and
   score-related features extracted from online formative assessments are
   particularly useful for predicting students' course performance.
   Implications for practice and/or policy This study provides strong
   evidence for using online formative assessments as the foundation for
   predictive models in learning analytics. Student data from online
   formative assessments can help educators provide students with feedback
   while informing future formative assessment cycles. Higher education
   institutions should avoid the hype around complex data from learning
   management systems and instead rely on effective learning tools such as
   online formative assessments to revolutionize the use of learning
   analytics.},

Abstract = {Virtual Learning Environments (VLE), such as Moodie and Blackboard,
   store vast data to help identify students' performance and engagement.
   As a result, researchers have been focusing their efforts on assisting
   educational institutions in providing machine learning models to predict
   at-risk students and to improve their performance. However, it requires
   an efficient approach to construct a model that can ultimately provide
   accurate predictions. Consequently, this study proposed a hybrid machine
   learning framework to predict students' performance using eight
   classification algorithms and three ensemble methods (Bagging, Boosting,
   Voting) to determine the best-performing predictive model. In addition,
   this study used filter-based and wrapper-based feature selection
   techniques to select the best features of the dataset related to
   students' performance. The obtained results reveal that the ensemble
   methods recorded higher predictive accuracy when compared to single
   classifiers. Furthermore, the accuracy of the models improved due to the
   feature selection techniques utilized in this study.},

   to generating knowledge for decision-making. In this sense, it is
   relevant to define the state of the art of the contributions of data
   mining in the university environment, and from there, to see in
   perspective how these could be applied in scenarios of return to the
   face-to-face. In this sense, a systematic review of the literature is
   carried out, based on scientific evidence extracted from the Taylor \&
   Francis, ERIC and Scopus data- bases. A qualitative content analysis
   approach and the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
   reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement were used to extract the findings
   published in scientific articles. The results were that educational data
   mining was applied to a greater extent in the field of ``teaching{''},
   and it was focused on the search for patterns and predictive models to
   improve student performance, reduce student dropout, improve the
   student's qual-ity of life, and teacher performance. In addition, as a
   resource for data extraction, university learning management systems
   (LMS) were used to a greater extent. It is concluded that tools such as
   data mining should be implemented as academic management policies,
   achieving a prospective on indicators linked to the improvement of
   student learning and performance.},

Title = {A Novel Deep Learning Model for Student Performance Prediction Using

Abstract = {Technology-enhanced learning supported by virtual learning environments
   (VLEs) facilitates tutors and students. VLE platforms contain a wealth
   of information that can be used to mine insight regarding students'
   learning behaviour and relationships between behaviour and academic
   performance, as well as to model data-driven decision-making. This study
   introduces a system that we termed ASIST: a novel Attention-aware
   convolutional Stacked BiLSTM network for student representation learning
   to predict their performance. ASIST exploits student academic registry,
   VLE click stream, and midterm continuous assessment information for
   their behaviour representation learning. ASIST jointly learns the
   student representation using five behaviour vectors. It processes the
   four sequential behaviour vectors using a separate stacked bidirectional
   long short term memory (LSTM) network. A deep convolutional neural
   network models the diurnal weekly interaction behaviour. It also employs
   the attention mechanism to assign weight to features based on their
   importance. Next, five encoded feature vectors are concatenated with the
   assessment information, and, finally, a softmax layer predicts the
   high-performer (H), moderate-performer (M), and at-risk (F) categories
   of students. We evaluate ASIST over three datasets from an Irish
   university, considering five evaluation metrics. ASIST achieves an area
   under the curve (AUC) score of 0.86 to 0.90 over the three datasets. It
   outperforms three baseline deep learning models and four traditional
   classification models. We also found that the attention mechanism has a
   slight impact on ASIST's performance. The ablation analysis reveals that
   weekly event count has the greatest impact on ASIST, whereas diurnal
   weekly interaction has the least impact. The early prediction using the
   first seven weeks of data achieves an AUC of 0.83 up to 0.89 over the
   three datasets. In yearly analysis, ASIST performs best over the 2018/19
   dataset and worst over the 2020/21 dataset.},

Title = {Intelligent Decision Support System for Predicting Student's E-Learning
   Performance Using Ensemble Machine Learning},
Journal = {MATHEMATICS},
Year = {2021},

Abstract = {Electronic learning management systems provide live environments for
   students and faculty members to connect with their institutional online
   portals and perform educational activities virtually. Although modern
   technologies proactively support these online sessions, students' active
   participation remains a challenge that has been discussed in previous
   research. Additionally, one concern for both parents and teachers is how
   to accurately measure student performance using different attributes
   collected during online sessions. Therefore, the research idea
   undertaken in this study is to understand and predict the performance of
   the students based on features extracted from electronic learning
   management systems. The dataset chosen in this study belongs to one of
   the learning management systems providing a number of features
   predicting student's performance. The integrated machine learning model
   proposed in this research can be useful to make proactive and
   intelligent decisions according to student performance evaluated through
   the electronic system's data. The proposed model consists of five
   traditional machine learning algorithms, which are further enhanced by
   applying four ensemble techniques: bagging, boosting, stacking, and
   voting. The overall F1 scores of the single models are as follows: DT
   (0.675), RF (0.777), GBT (0.714), NB (0.654), and KNN (0.664). The model
   performance has shown remarkable improvement using ensemble approaches.
   The stacking model by combining all five classifiers has outperformed
   and recorded the highest F1 score (0.8195) among other ensemble methods.
   The integration of the ML models has improved the prediction ratio and
   performed better than all other ensemble approaches. The proposed model
   can be useful for predicting student performance and helping educators
   to make informed decisions by proactively notifying the students.},

Abstract = {Research on the relationship between the digital traces of students in
   Learning Management Systems (LMS) and their academic performance has
   traditionally been an area of interest in the field of learning
   analytics. Aiming at achieving high interpretability and
   generalizability, this study reviews past research, defines a new
   categorization scheme for interactions in LMS and investigates the
   relationships between clickstream data of students' activity and course
   performance, measured as final grade. The results of the multiple
   regression analysis of Moodle log data collected from three courses of
   diverse nature using various classifications of interactions suggest
   that the new categorization, the CILC (Classification of Interactions
   based on the Learning Cycle), improves the explanatory power when
   compared to previous classifications. The analysis suggests that the
   predictive ability of the models could depend on the delivery mode, with
   predictions improving as the delivery mode transitions from face -to
   -face learning to online learning. This finding highlights the need for
   context-specific considerations about the learning process. Compared to
   previous research, the analysis also reveals nuances that suggest that
   the relationships may depend on the instructional design. Finally, the
   findings also seem to support the notion that increased data quantity
   and quality may improve predictive models. In summary, the study
   contributes with valuable insights into the interplay between LMS
   interactions, course delivery mode, instructional design, and academic
   performance, and advocates for a balanced exploration of white -box and
   black -box modeling approaches in learning analytics research.},

Title = {Massive LMS log data analysis for the early prediction of
   course-agnostic student performance},
Journal = {COMPUTERS \& EDUCATION},
Year = {2021},
Volume = {163},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {The early prediction of students' performance is a valuable resource to
   improve their learning. If we are able to detect at-risk students in the
   initial stages of the course, we will have more time to improve their
   performance. Likewise, excellent students could be motivated with
   customized additional activities. This is why there are research works
   aimed to early detect students' performance. Some of them try to achieve
   it with the analysis of LMS log files, which store information about
   student interaction with the LMS. Many works create predictive models
   with the log files generated for the whole course, but those models are
   not useful for early prediction because the actual log information used
   for predicting is different to the one used to train the models. Other
   works do create predictive models with the log information retrieved at
   the early stages of courses, but they are just focused on a particular
   type of course.
   In this work, we use machine learning to create models for the early
   prediction of students' performance in solving LMS assignments, by just
   analyzing the LMS log files generated up to the moment of prediction.
   Moreover, our models are course agnostic, because the datasets are
   created with all the University of Oviedo(1) courses for one academic
   year. We predict students' performance at 10\%, 25\%, 33\% and 50\% of
   the course length. Our objective is not to predict the exact student's
   mark in LMS assignments, but to detect at-risk, fail and excellent
   students in the early stages of the course. That is why we create
   different classification models for each of those three student groups.
   Decision tree, nave Bayes, logistic regression, multilayer perceptron
   (MLP) neural network, and support vector machine models are created and
   evaluated. Accuracies of all the models grow as the moment of prediction
   increases. Although all the algorithms but nave Bayes show accuracy
   differences lower than 5\%, MLP obtains the best performance: from
   80.1\% accuracy when 10\% of the course has been delivered to 90.1\%
   when half of it has taken place. We also discuss the LMS log entries
   that most influence the students' performance. By using a clustering
   algorithm, we detect six different clusters of students regarding their
   interaction with the LMS. Analyzing the interaction patterns of each
   cluster, we find that those patterns are repeated in all the early
   stages of the course. Finally, we show how four out of those six
   student-LMS interaction patterns have a strong correlation with
   students' performance.},

Title = {Discriminable Multi-Label Attribute Selection for Pre-Course Student
   Performance Prediction},
Journal = {ENTROPY},

Abstract = {The university curriculum is a systematic and organic study complex with
   some immediate associated steps; the initial learning of each semester's
   course is crucial, and significantly impacts the learning process of
   subsequent courses and further studies. However, the low teacher-student
   ratio makes it difficult for teachers to consistently follow up on the
   detail-oriented learning situation of individual students. The extant
   learning early warning system is committed to automatically detecting
   whether students have potential difficulties-or even the risk of
   failing, or non-pass reports-before starting the course. Previous
   related research has the following three problems: first of all, it
   mainly focused on e-learning platforms and relied on online activity
   data, which was not suitable for traditional teaching scenarios;
   secondly, most current methods can only proffer predictions when the
   course is in progress, or even approaching the end; thirdly, few studies
   have focused on the feature redundancy in these learning data. Aiming at
   the traditional classroom teaching scenario, this paper transforms the
   pre-class student performance prediction problem into a multi-label
   learning model, and uses the attribute reduction method to
   scientifically streamline the characteristic information of the courses
   taken and explore the important relationship between the characteristics
   of the previously learned courses and the attributes of the courses to
   be taken, in order to detect high-risk students in each course before
   the course begins. Extensive experiments were conducted on 10 real-world
   datasets, and the results proved that the proposed approach achieves
   better performance than most other advanced methods in multi-label
   classification evaluation metrics.</p>},

Title = {Multi-task MIML learning for pre-course student performance prediction},
Journal = {FRONTIERS OF COMPUTER SCIENCE},
Year = {2020},
Volume = {14},
Number = {5},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {In higher education, the initial studying period of each course plays a
   crucial role for students, and seriously influences the subsequent
   learning activities. However, given the large size of a course's
   students at universities, it has become impossible for teachers to keep
   track of the performance of individual students. In this circumstance,
   an academic early warning system is desirable, which automatically
   detects students with difficulties in learning (i.e., at-risk students)
   prior to a course starting. However, previous studies are not well
   suited to this purpose for two reasons: 1) they have mainly concentrated
   on e-learning platforms, e.g., massive open online courses (MOOCs), and
   relied on the data about students' online activities, which is hardly
   accessed in traditional teaching scenarios; and 2) they have only made
   performance prediction when a course is in progress or even close to the
   end. In this paper, for traditional classroom-teaching scenarios, we
   investigate the task of pre-course student performance prediction, which
   refers to detecting at-risk students for each course before its
   commencement. To better represent a student sample and utilize the
   correlations among courses, we cast the problem as a multi-instance
   multi-label (MIML) problem. Besides, given the problem of data scarcity,
   we propose a novel multi-task learning method, i.e., MIML-Circle, to
   predict the performance of students from different specialties in a
   unified framework. Extensive experiments are conducted on five
   real-world datasets, and the results demonstrate the superiority of our
   approach over the state-of-the-art methods.},

Title = {Assignments as Influential Factor to Improve the Prediction of Student
   Performance in Online Courses},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Studies on the prediction of student success in distance learning have
   explored mainly demographics factors and student interactions with the
   virtual learning environments. However, it is remarkable that a very
   limited number of studies use information about the assignments
   submitted by students as influential factor to predict their academic
   achievement. This paper aims to explore the real importance of
   assignment information for solving students' performance prediction in
   distance learning and evaluate the beneficial effect of including this
   information. We investigate and compare this factor and its potential
   from two information representation approaches: the traditional
   representation based on single instances and a more flexible
   representation based on Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), focus on
   handle weakly labeled data. A comparative study is carried out using the
   Open University Learning Analytics dataset, one of the most important
   public datasets in education provided by one of the greatest online
   universities of United Kingdom. The study includes a wide set of
   different types of machine learning algorithms addressed from the two
   data representation commented, showing that algorithms using only
   information about assignments with a representation based on MIL can
   outperform more than 20\% the accuracy with respect to a representation
   based on single instance learning. Thus, it is concluded that applying
   an appropriate representation that eliminates the sparseness of data
   allows to show the relevance of a factor, such as the assignments
   submitted, not widely used to date to predict students' academic
   performance. Moreover, a comparison with previous works on the same
   dataset and problem shows that predictive models based on MIL using only
   assignments information obtain competitive results compared to previous
   studies that include other factors to predict students performance.},

Abstract = {The rapid evolution of e-learning platforms, propelled by advancements
   in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), presents a
   transformative potential in education. This dynamic landscape
   necessitates an exploration of AI/ML integration in adaptive learning
   systems to enhance educational outcomes. This study aims to map the
   current utilization of AI/ML in e-learning for adaptive learning,
   elucidating the benefits and challenges of such integration and
   assessing its impact on student engagement, retention, and performance.
   A comprehensive literature review was conducted, focusing on articles
   published from 2010 onwards, to document the integration of AI/ML in
   e-learning. The review analyzed 63 articles, employing a systematic
   approach to evaluate the deployment of adaptive learning algorithms and
   their educational implications. Findings reveal that AI/ML algorithms
   are instrumental in personalizing learning experiences. These
   technologies have been shown to optimize learning paths, enhance
   engagement, and improve academic performance, with some studies
   reporting increased test scores. The integration of AI/ML in e-learning
   platforms significantly contributes to the personalization and
   effectiveness of the educational process. Despite challenges like data
   privacy and the complexity of AI/ML systems, the results underscore the
   potential of adaptive learning to revolutionize education by catering to
   individual learner needs.},

Title = {The Positive Impact of Deliberate Writing Course Design on Student
   Learning Experience and Performance},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF LEARNING ANALYTICS},

Abstract = {Learning management systems (LMSs) are ubiquitous components of the
   academic technology experience for learners across a wide variety of
   instructional contexts. Learners' interactions within an LMS are often
   contingent upon how instructors architect a module, course, or program
   of study. Patterns related to these learner interactions, often referred
   to as learning analytics implementation (LAI), can be represented by
   combining system-level LMS data with course-level design decisions to
   inform more granular insights into learner behaviour. The purpose of
   this paper is to use the LAI framework, specifically the principles of
   coordination and comparison (Wise \& Vytasek, 2017), to examine how
   learner interaction patterns associated with LMS-use variables
   correspond to deliberate learning design decisions and course outcomes
   for a group of courses in the same undergraduate writing program.
   Visualizations of learner activity exhibited similar patterns of learner
   engagement across courses, corroborating the observation that design
   decisions heavily influence learner behaviour. Predictive analyses
   demonstrated strong influence of LMS use on final grades while
   accounting for course instructor. That is, while page views were not
   related to final grade, the length of discussion entries was often
   predictive. These results suggest that students who practised writing
   more - the main learning objective of this course - had higher final
   grades, regardless of variations in instructor and semester.},

Abstract = {Predicting student performance is crucial in higher education, as it
   facilitates course selection and the development of appropriate future
   study plans. The process of supporting the instructors and supervisors
   in monitoring students in order to upkeep them and combine training
   programs to get the best outcomes. It decreases the official warning
   signs and inefficient students' expulsions. Therefore, analysis of
   students' performance on various academic tests is critical for future
   skill development. Despite the fact that existing performance prediction
   systems based on Deep Learning (DL) technologies such as Artificial
   Neural Networks (ANN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) have outperformed
   Machine Learning (ML) -based systems in the prediction task, there are
   still a few issues. Ignorance of relevant features, analysis limitations
   to the existing amount of data points, and ambiguity in student records
   are only a few of these issues. This research proposes a novel Student
   Academic Performance Predicting (SAPP) system to address these issues
   and enhance prediction accuracy. It has a better architecture that uses
   a combination of 4-layer stacked Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network,
   Random Forest (RF), and Gradient Boosting (GB) techniques to predict
   students' pass or fail outcomes. Additionally, the proposed SAPP system
   is compared to existing prediction systems using publicly accessible
   student OULAD dataset with an addition of self-curated emotional
   dataset. The performance of SAPP system is measured using Accuracy,
   Precision, F-measure, and Recall parameters. The results of proposed
   algorithm (LSTM + RF + B) is compared with LSTM + RF, LSTM + B and end
   to end DL models such as ANN, LSTM, RNN, Convolutional Neural Network
   (CNN) and most commonly utilized ML models in the literature such as
   Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), Naive Bayes (NB) and
   RF. The proposed SAPP system gained approximately 96\% prediction
   accuracy that is comparatively higher than existing systems.},

Abstract = {Blended learning pedagogical practices supported by learning management
   systems have become an important part of higher education curricula. In
   most cases, these blended curricula are evaluated through multimodal
   formative assessments. Although assessments can strongly affect student
   outcomes, research on the topic is limited. In this paper, we adopted a
   learning analytics approach to explore student engagement with formative
   assessments and the power of these assessments to predict student
   outcomes in an English for Academic Purposes courses in a Hong Kong
   university. The study retrieved the data logs from 7,815 students and
   used the data to analyze student engagement with the formative
   assessments. The results suggested that the students put effort into
   completing the assessments. The degree to which assessments predict
   learning outcomes depend on students' level of subject knowledge and
   their understanding of the relevance of the assessments. This study
   showed that learning analytics provided reliable evidence for
   understanding students' engagement and identifying at-risk students.
   Therefore, learning analytics research has the potential to inform
   pedagogical practice.},

Abstract = {E -learning platforms have become increasingly popular in K-8 education
   to promote student learning and enhance classroom teaching. Student
   interactions with these platforms produce trace data, which are digital
   records of learning processes. Although trace data have been effective
   in identifying learners' engagement profiles in higher education and
   lifelong learning (e.g., MOOCs), similar research on young learners has
   been very scarce. This study makes a timely and novel contribution to
   the field by identifying emerging profiles of young students from Grades
   1 to 8 based on their engagement in an e -learning platform. The k
   -means cluster analysis yielded seven distinct profiles in total. While
   the dominance of profiles differed across grade levels, some profiles
   were not even present at specific grades, indicating the changing
   engagement behaviours of young learners in different years. In addition,
   all emerging profiles suggest students tended to focus on specific
   components of the platform, thus lacking balanced engagement with all
   resources. In particular, while primary school students showed
   relatively higher interest in game -based learning, middle school
   students focused more on exams than their counterparts. The findings
   yielded seven specific considerations for the design of effective e
   -learning platforms.},

Abstract = {This work proposes an innovative visual tool for real-time continuous
   learners analytics. The purpose of the work is to improve the design,
   functionality, and usability of learning management systems to monitor
   user activity to allow educators to make informed decisions on
   e-learning design, usually limited to dashboards graphs, tables, and
   low-usability user logs. The standard visualisation is currently scarce,
   and often inadequate to inform educators about the design quality and
   students engagement on their learning objects. The same low usability
   can be found in learning analytics tools, which mostly focus on
   post-course analysis, demanding specific skills to be effectively used,
   e.g., for statistical analysis and database queries. We propose a tool
   for student analytics embedded in a Learning Management System, based on
   the innovative visual metaphor of interface morphing. Artificial
   intelligence provides in remote learning immediate feedback, crucial in
   a face-to-face setting, highlighting the students' engagement in each
   single learning object. A visual metaphor is the representation of a
   person, group, learning object, or concept through a visual image that
   suggests a particular association or point of similarity. The basic idea
   is that elements of the application interface, e.g., learning objects'
   icons and student avatars, can be modified in colour and dimension to
   reflect key performance indicators of learner's activities. The goal is
   to provide high-affordance information on the student engagement and
   usage of learning objects, where aggregation functions on subsets of
   users allow a dynamic evaluation of cohorts with different granularity.
   The proposed visual metaphors (i.e., thermometer bar, dimensional
   morphing, and tag cloud morphing) have been implemented and experimented
   within academic-level courses. Experimental results have been evaluated
   with a comparative analysis of user logs and a subjective usability

Title = {Transformer Encoder Model for Sequential Prediction of Student
   Performance Based on Their Log Activities},
Journal = {IEEE ACCESS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Pages = {18960-18971},
Abstract = {Learning management systems (LMSs) have been used massively due to the
   growing utilization of distance learning. This advancement has led to
   increased educational data that can be analyzed to improve the quality
   of the learning process. Learning analytics (LA) is one of the most
   important methods that can be used to analyze student performance. In
   this paper, we proposed an LA method based on deep learning, i.e.,
   transformer encoder, to sequentially predict the student's final
   performance based on log activities provided by an LMS. The objective is
   to predict at-risk students of failing so that they can be mitigated as
   soon as possible. The proposed model was evaluated on the Open
   University LA Dataset (OULAD) for daily or weekly prediction. The
   results show that the model could predict at the early stage with an
   accuracy of 83.17\% on withdrawn versus pass-distinction classes.
   Meanwhile, for the other tasks, i.e., withdrawn-fail versus
   pass-distinction and fail versus pass-distinction tasks, the accuracy
   was at least 76\% at the early stage. The proposed model was compared to
   the LSTM model. We found that the transformer encoder performed better
   than the LSTM, with the average difference values from 1\% to 3\% in
   terms of accuracy and from 3\% to 7\% in terms of F1-score for all
   tasks, based on the statistical testing. Furthermore, the ablation study
   using positional encoding, different feature aggregation methods, and
   weighted loss function for the imbalanced class problem was conducted.
   In OULAD, we found that model without positional encoding was better in
   all cases. Furthermore, the weekly feature aggregation and the use of a
   weighted loss function performed better in some cases.},

Title = {Extracting topological features to identify at-risk students using
   machine learning and graph convolutional network models},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY IN HIGHER EDUCATION},

Abstract = {Technological advances have significantly affected education, leading to
   the creation of online learning platforms such as virtual learning
   environments and massive open online courses. While these platforms
   offer a variety of features, none of them incorporates a module that
   accurately predicts students' academic performance and commitment.
   Consequently, it is crucial to design machine learning (ML) methods that
   predict student performance and identify at-risk students as early as
   possible. Graph representations of student data provide new insights
   into this area. This paper describes a simple but highly accurate
   technique for converting tabulated data into graphs. We employ distance
   measures (Euclidean and cosine) to calculate the similarities between
   students' data and construct a graph. We extract graph topological
   features (GF) to enhance our data. This allows us to capture structural
   correlations among the data and gain deeper insights than isolated data
   analysis. The initial dataset (DS) and GF can be used alone or jointly
   to improve the predictive power of the ML method. The proposed method is
   tested on an educational dataset and returns superior results. The use
   of DS alone is compared with the use of DS + GF in the classification of
   students into three classes: ``failed{''},{''}at risk{''}, and
   ``good{''}. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
   (AUC) reaches 0.948 using DS, compared with 0.964 for DS + GF. The
   accuracy in the case of DS + GF varies from 84.5 to 87.3\%. Adding GF
   improves the performance by 2.019\% in terms of AUC and 3.261\% in terms
   of accuracy. Moreover, by incorporating graph topological features
   through a graph convolutional network (GCN), the prediction performance
   can be enhanced by 0.5\% in terms of accuracy and 0.9\% in terms of AUC
   under the cosine distance matrix. With the Euclidean distance matrix,
   adding the GCN improves the prediction accuracy by 3.7\% and the AUC by
   2.4\%. By adding graph embedding features to ML models, at-risk students
   can be identified with 87.4\% accuracy and 0.97 AUC. The proposed
   solution provides a tool for the early detection of at-risk students.
   This will benefit universities and enhance their prediction performance,
   improving both effectiveness and reputation.},

Abstract = {E-learning platforms and processes face several challenges, among which
   is the idea of personalizing the e-learning experience and to keep
   students motivated and engaged. This work is part of a larger study that
   aims to tackle these two challenges using a variety of machine learning
   techniques. To that end, this paper proposes the use of k-means
   algorithm to cluster students based on 12 engagement metrics divided
   into two categories: interaction-related and effort-related.
   Quantitative analysis is performed to identify the students that are not
   engaged who may need help. Three different clustering models are
   considered: two-level, three-level, and five-level. The considered
   dataset is the students' event log of a second-year undergraduate
   Science course from a North American university that was given in a
   blended format. The event log is transformed using MATLAB to generate a
   new dataset representing the considered metrics. Experimental results'
   analysis shows that among the considered interaction-related and
   effort-related metrics, the number of logins and the average duration to
   submit assignments are the most representative of the students'
   engagement level. Furthermore, using the silhouette coefficient as a
   performance metric, it is shown that the two-level model offers the best
   performance in terms of cluster separation. However, the three-level
   model has a similar performance while better identifying students with
   low engagement levels.},

Abstract = {educational outcomes across varied institutions like universities,
   schools, and training centers necessitates accurately predicting student
   performance. These systems aggregates the data from multiple
   sources-exam centers, virtual courses, registration departments, and
   e-learning platforms. Analyzing this complex and diverse educational
   data is a challenge, thus necessitating the application of machine
   learning techniques. Utilizing machine learning algorithms for
   dimensionality reduction simplifies intricate datasets, enabling more
   comprehensive analysis. Through machine learning, educational data is
   refined, uncovering valuable patterns and forecasts by simplifying
   complexities via feature selection and dimensionality reduction methods.
   This refinement significantly amplifies the efficacy of student
   performance prediction systems, empowering educators and institutions
   with data-driven insights and thereby enriching the overall educational
   landscape. In this particular research, the Decision Tree Classification
   (DTC) model is used for forecasting student performance. DTC stands out
   as a potent machine-learning method for classification purposes. Two
   optimization algorithms, namely the Fox Optimization (FO) and the Black
   Widow Optimization (BWO), are integrated to heighten the model's
   accuracy and efficiency further. The amalgamation of DTC with these
   pioneering optimization techniques underscores the study's dedication to
   harnessing the forefront of machine learning and bio-inspired
   algorithms, ensuring more precise and resilient predictions of student
   performance, ultimately culminating in improved educational outcomes.
   From the results garnered for G1 and G3, it is evident that the DTBW
   model demonstrated the most exceptional performance in both predicting
   and categorizing G1, achieving an Accuracy and Precision value of 93.7
   percent. Conversely, the DTFO model emerged as the most precise
   predictor for G3, achieving an Accuracy and Precision of 93.4 and 93.5
   percent, respectively, in the prediction task.},

Title = {Students' Learning Behaviour in Programming Education Analysis: Insights
   from Entropy and Community Detection},
Journal = {ENTROPY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {25},
Number = {8},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {The high dropout rates in programming courses emphasise the need for
   monitoring and understanding student engagement, enabling early
   interventions. This activity can be supported by insights into students'
   learning behaviours and their relationship with academic performance,
   derived from student learning log data in learning management systems.
   However, the high dimensionality of such data, along with their numerous
   features, pose challenges to their analysis and interpretability. In
   this study, we introduce entropy-based metrics as a novel manner to
   represent students' learning behaviours. Employing these metrics, in
   conjunction with a proven community detection method, we undertake an
   analysis of learning behaviours across higher- and lower-performing
   student communities. Furthermore, we examine the impact of the COVID-19
   pandemic on these behaviours. The study is grounded in the analysis of
   empirical data from 391 Software Engineering students over three
   academic years. Our findings reveal that students in higher-performing
   communities typically tend to have lower volatility in entropy values
   and reach stable learning states earlier than their lower-performing
   counterparts. Importantly, this study provides evidence of the use of
   entropy as a simple yet insightful metric for educators to monitor study
   progress, enhance understanding of student engagement, and enable timely
   interventions.},

Title = {An Interpretable Framework for an Efficient Analysis of Students'
   Academic Performance},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {14},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Recent technological advancements in e-learning platforms have made it
   easy to store and manage students' related data, such as personal
   details, initial grade, intermediate grades, final grades, and many
   other parameters. These data can be efficiently processed and analyzed
   by intelligent techniques and algorithms to generate useful insights
   into the students' performance, such as to identify the factors
   impacting the progress of successful students or the performance of the
   students who are struggling in their courses and are at risk of failing.
   Such a framework is scarce in the current literature. This study
   proposes an interpretable framework to generate useful insights from the
   data produced by e-learning platforms using machine learning algorithms.
   The proposed framework incorporates predictive models, as well as
   regression and classification models to analyze multiple factors of
   student performance. Classification models are used to systematize
   normal and at-risk students based on their academic performance, with
   high precision and accuracy. Regression analysis is performed to
   determine the inherent linear and nonlinear relationships between the
   academic outcomes of the students acting as the target or independent
   variables and the performance indicative features acting as dependent
   variables. For further analysis, a predictive modeling problem is
   considered, where the performance of the students is anticipated based
   on their commitment to a specific course, their performance for the
   whole course, and their final grades. The efficiency of the proposed
   framework is also optimized by reliably tuning the algorithmic
   parameters. Furthermore, the performance is accelerated by empowering
   the system with a GPU-based infrastructure. Results reveal that the
   proposed interpretable framework is highly accurate and precise and can
   identify factors that play a vital role in the students' success or
   failure.},

Abstract = {Learning management systems (LMSs) are ubiquitous in higher education,
   yet few studies have examined changes in student engagement online with
   year level. Using data mining of LMSs, we examined the frequency and
   timing with which first, second, and third year science students
   accessed the various LMS resources. We compared online access with both
   attendance and performance. The findings demonstrated that students of
   all year levels showed a preference for lecture slides over recordings,
   although there was a marked increase in engagement with year level. For
   all students, the pattern of engagement with online resources was
   largely a function of motivation and exam anxiety-students accessed the
   LMS most frequently in the final three weeks of semester. Finally,
   attendance was predictive of performance only for first year students,
   with this demonstrating that approaches are required especially for
   these students to increase engagement. This study has shown that
   engagement can vary across year levels and should be considered when
   designing teaching and learning activities.},

Abstract = {Personalized or precision education (PE) considers the integration of
   multimodal technologies to tailor individuals' learning experiences
   based on their preferences and needs. To identify the impact that
   emerging multimodal technologies have on personalized education, we
   reviewed recent implementations and applications of systems (e.g.,
   MOOCs, serious games, artificial intelligence, learning management
   systems, mobile applications, augmented/virtual reality, classroom
   technologies) that integrate such features. Our findings revealed that
   PE techniques could leverage the instructional potential of educational
   platforms and tools by facilitating students' knowledge acquisition and
   skill development. The added value of PE is also extended beyond the
   online digital learning context, as positive outcomes were also
   identified in blended/face-to-face learning scenarios, with multiple
   connections being discussed between the impact of PE on student
   efficacy, achievement, and well-being. In line with the recommendations
   and suggestions that supporters of PE make, we provide implications for
   research and practice as well as ground for policy formulation and
   reformation on how multimodal technologies can be integrated into the
   educational context.},

Title = {Intentionality and Players of Effective Online Courses in Mathematics},

Abstract = {Mathematics is the engine, vehicle, driver, and language of today's
   initiatives, innovations, and human endeavors. In this
   mathematical-driven world, the ability to perform mathematical tasks and
   logical reasoning is also essential in solving quotidian tasks and
   problems. Therefore, mathematical competency and problem-solving skills
   are kept as an integral component in almost every educational curriculum
   around the globe. However, there are numerous stumbling blocks along the
   way to successful teaching, conducive learning environment, and good
   student performances in almost all disciplines, but more prevalent and
   visible in mathematics. The major concerns of educators responsible for
   teaching mathematics and mathematics-related courses are to find
   effective and innovative ways to deliver mathematical content, to extend
   the concepts and theories beyond the classrooms, to integrate
   mathematics with important concepts such as gamification, data mining,
   learning analytics, deep learning, and effective tools such as mobile
   devices, learning management systems, and digital technology, and to
   maintain a good record of students' performance. In online deliveries,
   these concerns are further escalated due to no or limited one-to-one
   interactions and lack of face time, to mention a few. This article
   investigates the efficacy and effectiveness of traditional and
   innovative pedagogical practices used in online mathematic courses at
   the University of the South Pacific (USP). It examines the
   interdependence of embedded activities and students' achievement. The
   results indicate that these online mathematics courses were highly
   dominated by conventional approaches and were less interactive and
   engaging, resulting in lower success rates when compared to the courses
   from other disciplines. To recommend possible ways to enhance the
   quality of learning and teaching in online mathematics courses, selected
   online courses from the information system discipline were explored. The
   reasons for the high online presence in the course were investigated and
   activities that could lead to collaborative and active learning beyond
   the passive materials were data mined. The evidence drawn from the
   statistical analysis highlights the importance of including selected
   interactive and engaging activities in online learning space of
   mathematics courses to promote student engagement and help create a
   sense of community among geographically dispersed students. Overall,
   based on the observations and theoretical foundation from literature, it
   can be said that including regular and frequent active assessment
   strategies, such as weekly quizzes and discussion forums, could extend
   and promote interactive and engaging learning in online learning space.},

Abstract = {Monitoring students in Learning Management Systems (LMS) throughout the
   teaching-learning process has been shown to be a very effective
   technique for detecting students at risk. Likewise, the teaching style
   in the LMS conditions, the type of student behaviours on the platform
   and the learning outcomes. The main objective of this study was to test
   the effectiveness of three teaching modalities (all using Online
   Project-based Learning -OPBL- and Flipped Classroom experiences and
   differing in the use of virtual laboratories and Intelligent Personal
   Assistant -IPA-) on Moodle behaviour and student performance taking into
   account the covariate ``collaborative group{''}. Both quantitative and
   qualitative research methods were used. With regard to the quantitative
   analysis, differences were found in student behaviour in Moodle and in
   learning outcomes, with respect to teaching modalities that included
   virtual laboratories. Similarly, the qualitative study also analysed the
   behaviour patterns found in each collaborative group in the three
   teaching modalities studied. The results indicate that the collaborative
   group homogenises the learning outcomes, but not the behaviour pattern
   of each member. Future research will address the analysis of
   collaborative behaviour in LMSs according to different variables
   (motivation and metacognitive strategies in students, number of members,
   interactions between students and teacher in the LMS, etc.).},
