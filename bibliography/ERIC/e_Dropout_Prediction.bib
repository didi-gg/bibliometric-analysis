Abstract = {Inefficient targeting of students at risk of dropping out might explain why dropout-reducing efforts often have no or mixed effects. In this study, we present a new method which uses a series of machine learning algorithms to efficiently identify students at risk and makes the sensitivity/precision trade-off inherent in targeting students for dropout prevention explicit. Data of a Dutch vocational education institute is used to show how out-of-sample machine learning predictions can be used to formulate invitation rules in a way that targets students at risk more effectively, thereby facilitating early detection for effective dropout prevention.},

Abstract = {In recent years, initiatives and the resulting application of precision education have been applied with increasing frequency in Taiwan; the accompanying discourse has focused on identifying potential applications for artificial intelligence and how to use learning analytics to improve teaching quality and learning outcomes. This study used the established dropout risk prediction model to improve student learning effectiveness. The model was based on the academic portfolios of past students and built with statistical learning and deep learning methods. This study used this model to predict the dropout risk of 2205 freshmen enrolled in the fall semester of 2018 (graduated in June 2022) in the field of sustainable education. A total of 176 students with a dropout risk of more than 20% were considered high-risk students. After tracking and the appropriate guidance, the dropout risk of 91 students fell from > 20% to < 20%. To discuss the results from the perspective of gender and financial disadvantages, the improvement rate of the dropout risk for male students was 10.2% better than that of female students at 2.9%. The improvement rate in dropout risk for students with disadvantageous financial situations was as high as 12.0%, surpassing the 5.9% rate among general students. Overall, the dropout rate in the second year of the 2018 freshman cohort was lower than that of the 2016 and 2017 freshman cohorts. A predictive model established by statistical learning and deep learning methods was used as a tool to promote precision education, accurately and efficiently identifying students who are having difficulty learning, as well as leading to a better understanding of AI (artificial intelligence) in smart learning for sustainable education.},

Abstract = {Dropout is one of the major problems online higher education faces. Early identification of the dropout risk level and an intervention mechanism to revert the potential risk have been proved as the key answers to solving the challenge. Predictive modeling has been extensively studied on course dropout. However, intervention practices are scarce, sometimes mixed with mechanisms focused on course failure, and commonly focused on limited interventions driven mainly by teachers' experience. This work contributes with a novel approach for identifying course dropout based on a dynamic time interval and intervening, focusing on avoiding dropout at the assessable activity level. Moreover, the system can recommend the best interval for a course and assessable activity based on artificial intelligence techniques to help teachers in this challenging task. The system has been tested on a fully online first-year course with 581 participants from 957 enrolled learners of different degrees from the Faculty of Economics and Business at the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya. Results confirm that interventions aimed at goal setting on the ongoing assessable activity significantly reduce dropout issues and increase engagement within the course. Additionally, the work explores the differences between identification mechanisms for course dropout and failure aiming to distinguish them as different problems that learners may face.},

Abstract = {Early Warning Systems (EWS) in higher education accommodate student counsellors by identifying at-risk students and allow them to intervene in a timely manner to prevent student dropout. This study evaluates an EWS that shares student-specific risk information with student counsellors, which was implemented at a large Dutch university. A randomised field experiment was conducted to estimate the effect of EWS-assisted counselling on first-year student dropout and academic performance. The results show that the EWS accurately predicts at-risk students. Yet, EWS-assisted counselling did not reduce dropout, nor improved academic performance. Solving the underlying problem of poor academic performance might require additional actionable feedback and recommended counselling practices.},

Abstract = {The Legislature established the Graduation: A Team Effort (GATE) Advisory (originally known as Building Bridges Workgroup) in 2007 to keep all students visible and on track to graduate from high school. The state's ongoing engagement and reengagement efforts are based on the three major recommendations of the original Building Bridges Workgroup: (1) Set an educational goal for youth and family-serving agencies and coordinate efforts to achieve it; (2) Build local dropout prevention and intervention systems and practices at every grade level; and (3) Create a dropout reengagement system for 16-24-year-old youth who are not likely to return to high school. The GATE Advisory Committee met regularly over the course of the 2022-23 school year to promote and expand effective dropout prevention, intervention, and reengagement policy and programming. As a result of these discussions, the Committee proposed the following recommendations to the legislature: (1) Develop a statewide early warning and intervention system; (2) Build capacity to create school schedules that are inclusive and driven by high expectations; (3) Increase capacity for the implementation of Ninth Grade Success Teams; (4) Support youth reengagement efforts through the establishment of barrier reduction funding for Open Doors Youth Reengagement programs; and (5) Expand resources to support school/community dropout prevention, intervention, and reengagement system support.},

Abstract = {School dropout is a structural problem which permanently penalizes students and society in areas such as low qualification jobs, higher poverty levels and lower life expectancy, lower pensions, and higher economic burden for governments. Given these high consequences and the surge of the problem due to COVID-19 pandemic, in this paper we propose a methodology to design, develop, and evaluate a machine learning model for predicting dropout in school systems. In this methodology, we introduce necessary steps to develop a robust model to estimate the individual risk of each student to drop out of school. As advancement from previous research, this proposal focuses on analyzing individual trajectories of students, incorporating the student situation at school, family, among other levels, changes, and accumulation of events to predict dropout. Following the methodology, we create a model for the Chilean case based on data available mostly through administrative data from the educational system, and according to known factors associated with school dropout. Our results are better than those from previous research with a relevant sample size, with a predictive capability 20% higher for the actual dropout cases. Also, in contrast to previous work, the including non-individual dimensions results in a substantive contribution to the prediction of leaving school. We also illustrate applications of the model for Chilean case to support public policy decision making such as profiling schools for qualitative studies of pedagogic practices, profiling students' dropout trajectories and simulating scenarios.},

Abstract = {Course dropout is a concern in online higher education, mainly in first-year courses when different factors negatively influence the learners' engagement leading to an unsuccessful outcome or even dropping out from the university. The early identification of such potential at-risk learners is the key to intervening and trying to help them before they decide to drop out. This article focuses on this challenging problem by providing a predictive dropout model with distinctive characteristics from previous approaches. First, the identification is in real time by providing a daily dropout prediction. Second, a temporal window of variable size is defined to evaluate the likelihood of being a dropout learner at the activity level. Such contributions will serve as a basis for designing and applying intervention mechanisms to reverse the course dropout at-risk situation. The predictive model and the temporal window have been evaluated on data from an authentic online learning setting in two first-year undergraduate courses. We show the accuracy of correctly identifying at-risk learners within activities and the model performance to detect actual course dropout learners.},

Abstract = {Online learning has become more popular in higher education since it adds convenience and flexibility to students' schedule. But, it has faced difficulties in the retention of the continuity of students and ensure continual growth in course. Dropout is a concerning factor in online course continuity. Therefore, it has sparked great interest among educators and researchers to offer many models and strategies to reduce online course students' dropout by analyzing students' behavior and their individual and academic information. However, online education platforms still face challenges of high dropout rate and the difficulty of accurate prediction to reduce it. The key aim of the present study is to construct a predictive model to early predict students who are at-risk of dropout. This model is useful to the course instructors to make effective and timely interventions. We have noticed that dropout prediction is basically a sequence labeling or time series prediction problem. For these reasons, we proposed two models; the Logistic Regression by adding a regularization term and the Input-Output Hidden Markov Model (IOHMM). Results showed that the proposed models achieved an accuracy of 84% compared to the baseline of Machine Learning Models for prediction of the students at-risk of dropping out.},

Abstract = {Emphasis in school dropout literature has shifted from exploring wide-ranging causes of dropping out to soliciting a smaller number of predictive indicators to identify students at increased risk for dropping out. However, much of the past decade's Early Warning research excludes indicators that do not add to the predictive nature of the model even if they might inform intervention. Considering this shift and the relative infancy of Early Warning research, this paper presents a critical systematic review of the literature surrounding dropout and Early Warning System(s) (EWS). Through a focus and evaluation of student-level indicators, we present an argument of how an effective EWS can bridge the gap between the prediction of dropout events and underlying causes, while providing actionable information for schools to intervene. Finally, we present preliminary data that demonstrate the potential of elementary-level student-level indicators as an avenue for shifting the focus of EWS from student identification to meaningful prediction and intervention. The results show how the student-level indicators explored in this paper can effectively identify students at these grade levels who are on- and off-track to graduation. We discuss the implications of evidence warranting the position that dropping out of school can be predicted as early as the elementary grade levels and its potential to drive future research in this area.},

Abstract = {Aim/Purpose: One of the main objectives of higher education institutions is to provide a high-quality education to their students and reduce dropout rates. This can be achieved by predicting students' academic achievement early using Educational Data Mining (EDM). This study aims to predict students' final grades and identify honorary students at an early stage. Background: EDM research has emerged as an exciting research area, which can unfold valuable knowledge from educational databases for many purposes, such as identifying the dropouts and students who need special attention and discovering honorary students for allocating scholarships. Methodology: In this work, we have collected 300 undergraduate students' records from three departments of a Computer and Information Science College at a university located in Saudi Arabia. We compared the performance of six data mining methods in predicting academic achievement. Those methods are C4.5, Simple CART, LADTree, Naïve Bayes, Bayes Net with ADTree, and Random Forest. Contribution: We tested the significance of correlation attribute predictors using four different methods. We found 9 out of 18 proposed features with a significant correlation for predicting students' academic achievement after their 4th semester. Those features are student GPA during the first four semesters, the number of failed courses during the first four semesters, and the grades of three core courses, i.e., database fundamentals, programming language (1), and computer network fundamentals. Findings: The empirical results show the following: (i) the main features that can predict students' academic achievement are the student GPA during the first four semesters, the number of failed courses during the first four semesters, and the grades of three core courses; (ii) Naïve Bayes classifier performed better than Tree-based Models in predicting students' academic achievement in general, however, Random Forest outperformed Naïve Bayes in predicting honorary students; (iii) English language skills do not play an essential role in students' success at the college of Computer and Information Sciences; and (iv) studying an orientation year does not contribute to students' success. Recommendations for Practitioners: We would recommend instructors to consider using EDM in predicting students' academic achievement and benefit from that in customizing students' learning experience based on their different needs. Recommendation for Researchers: We would highly endorse that researchers apply more EDM studies across various universities and compare between them. For example, future research could investigate the effects of offering tutoring sessions for students who fail core courses in their first semesters, examine the role of language skills in social science programs, and examine the role of the orientation year in other programs. Impact on Society: The prediction of academic performance can help both teachers and students in many ways. It also enables the early discovery of honorary students. Thus, well-deserved opportunities can be offered; for example, scholarships, internships, and workshops. It can also help identify students who require special attention to take an appropriate intervention at the earliest stage possible. Moreover, instructors can be aware of each student's capability and customize the teaching tasks based on students' needs. Future Research: For future work, the experiment can be repeated with a larger dataset. It could also be extended with more distinctive attributes to reach more accurate results that are useful for improving the students' learning outcomes. Moreover, experiments could be done using other data mining algorithms to get a broader approach and more valuable and accurate outputs.},

Abstract = {Predicting students' performance to identify which students are at risk of receiving a D/Fail/Withdraw (DFW) grade and ensuring their timely graduation is not just desirable but also necessary in most educational entities. In the US, not only is the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) major becoming less popular among students, the graduation rate of STEM students is steadily declining. The lack of STEM graduates in the US is a serious problem that will place this country at a disadvantage as a competitor in international technological advancement. In order to secure its status as a technological leader internationally, the US institutions must be more vigilant in predicting the grades of STEM students to improve student retention in STEM fields.Using early grade prediction allows the school to monitor students' course progress and increases their chances of graduating. Predicting grades is highly beneficial for at-risk STEM students because it allows for timely pedagogical interventions that can better equip the students for success in their courses and prevent dropouts. Identifying at-risk students is a complicated problem since there are many factors to consider. Traditional approaches to analyzing and using students' data have had mixed results in identifying factors that help predict students' performance early on in the semester. Machine learning can uniquely identify patterns that other approaches cannot, making it a promising method for grade prediction that is currently available. This study uses machine learning algorithms to identify the key factors that predict which students are at risk early in the semester. The results of this study show that demographic variables such as gender, academic level, and age are of little value in predicting student success. The factors with the highest correlation to the course grade were the students' cumulative college grade point average (GPA) and the grades that the students received on the first four homework assignments of the semester. These variables are provided as input to machine learning algorithms: logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest. Using machine learning, grades can be predicted with 80% to 97% accuracy in the first two to four weeks of the semester, which allows the university to intervene early on.

Abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to provide a parsimonious but rigorous model to assist decision-makers to determine critical factors which can lead to higher graduation rates amongst higher education institution (HEI) participants. It predicts the odds of dropout amongst university students, using HEI data from a developing country. This is used as a basis for a Student Retention Predictive (SRP) Model to inform HEI administrators about predicted risks of attrition amongst cohorts. Design/methodology/approach: A classification tool, the Logistic Regression Model, is fitted to the data set for a particular HEI in a developing country. The model is used to predict significant factors for student dropout and to create a base model for predicted risks by various student demographic variables. Findings: To reduce dropout and to ensure higher graduation rates, the model suggests that variables such as age group, faculty, academic standing and cumulative GPA are significant. These indicative results can drive intervention strategies to improve student retention in HEIs and lessen the gap between graduates and non-graduates, with the goal of reducing socio-economic inequalities in society. Originality/value: This research employs risk bands (low, medium and high) to classify students at risk of attrition or drop out. This provides invaluable insights to HEI administrators in the development of intervention strategies to reduce dropout and increase graduation rates to impact the wider public policy issue of socio-economic inequities.},

Abstract = {Background/Context: Emerging experiences suggest that research-practice partnerships (RPPs) can benefit both research and practice. As researchers and practitioners become part of the same social network, they also can become trusted sources of information for one another. By modeling the research use process, practitioners can incorporate what they learn into their own research acquisition and interpretation processes and researchers can gain a better understanding of how their work can be designed and conducted so that it is directly relevant to practice. Purpose/Focus of the Study: Prior literature on research-practice partnerships has identified common challenges of these partnerships such as turnover, trust, common language, and complex systems. The study follows a grounded theory approach to better understand challenges and dynamics within research-practice partnerships. Setting: The study included members of eight research-practice partnerships including two focused primarily on the use of early warning indicators to reduce high school dropout. Partnerships were diverse in their location and maturity. Five partnerships were located in the Midwest, one partnership was located in the South, and two partnerships were located in New England. Half of the partnerships were less than two years old at the time of the interviews, and the oldest partnership was 8 years old. Research Design: Using a grounded theory approach to better understand challenges and dynamics within RPPs, we analyzed qualitative interview data inductively to identify common themes discussed by respondents. Data Collection and Analysis: The study team conducted telephone interviews with two researchers and two practitioners from eight RPPs, for a total of 31 interviews -- one researcher was interviewed for two different partnerships. The team used semi-structured interview protocols aligned to the four research questions. In analyzing the interview data, we identified themes, categories, and theories that emerged from the data and confirmed or refuted our initial impressions. Findings: Researchers and practitioners across partnerships shared ten strategies used to address challenges faced by research practice partnerships. 1. Engaging in mutually responsive, transparent communication about partnership activities was a common strategy for ensuring partnership trust, building a common language, and preventing turnover. 2.Finding opportunities for human connection within the partnership is instrumental to developing trust. 3. Researchers and practitioners described bidirectional efforts to build shared understanding of language used in their respective contexts, including research methodologies and locally specific terminology employed by practitioners. 4. A high number of researchers and practitioners mentioned heightened consciousness of the use of language and ongoing efforts to check for understanding throughout the life of the partnership. 5. Overall, approximately half of the respondents highlighted the power of one or more partnership members with varied experiences in both research and practical content to bridge those worlds and make meaning for others. 6. To tackle the challenge of working in and across educational systems, respondents most-commonly mentioned the importance of having a diverse partnership composition or ensuring that there is representation of individuals from various levels and layers of the system. 7. In addition to bringing together a group of partnership members with a wide range of content knowledge, several respondents also noted the strategy of leveraging partnership "boundary spanners"--specific individuals with knowledge of multiple levels of the system who can help shape activities at the partnership level to help move the partnership's work across the system. 8. The strategy most frequently mentioned to engage members and ultimately cultivate trust and/or prevent turnover was to create authentic roles for practitioners and value practitioner voice. 9. Also mentioned by both researchers and practitioners was a relevant research agenda or focal topic concerning the development of trust, development of a common language, and prevention of member turnover. 10. Another commonly mentioned strategy for mitigating turnover was selecting natural replacements to fill positions that had turned over. Conclusions/Recommendations: This study provides guidance for researchers facilitating RPPs to reflect on the ways in which they are working with their partners to implement identified strategies. Practitioners participating in RPPs may want to provide their research partners with feedback on the extent to which they perceive these strategies being implemented in their partnership. Finally, researchers interested in building the literature on RPP processes and strategies might do so by conducting similar interviews with a larger sample of RPPs to further develop a typology of strategies for enhancing RPP efforts related to building trust and overcoming challenges. These strategies could be codified and used to train future researchers and practitioners who want to engage in or improve existing RPPs.},

Abstract = {The need for a knowledge-based society has perpetuated an increasing demand for higher education around the globe. Recently, there has been an increase in the demand for Computer Science professionals due to the rise in the use of ICT in the business, health and education sector. The enrollment numbers in Computer Science undergraduate programmes are usually high, but unfortunately, many of these students drop out from or abscond these programmes, leading to a shortage of Computer Science professionals in the job market. One way to diminish if not completely eradicate this problem is to identify students who are at risk of dropping out and provide them with special intervention programmes that will help them to remain in their programmes till graduation. In this paper, data mining techniques were used to build predictive models that can identify student dropout in Computer Science programmes, more specifically focusing on freshmen attrition since a significant number of dropout occurs in the first year of university studies. The predictive models were built for three stages of the first academic year using five classification algorithms which were Random Forest, Decision Tree, Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbour. The models used past five years of institutional data stored in university's repositories. Results show that the Naïve Bayes model performed better in stage 1 with an AUC of 0.6132 but in stages 2 and 3, the overall performance of the Logsitic Regression models were better with an AUC of 0.7523 and 0.8902, respectively.},

Abstract = {Background: Research shows that educators can identify half of future high school dropouts as early as Grade 6--and three quarters or more of future dropouts by Grade 9--by monitoring readily available data on attendance, behavior, and course performance. These data have come to be known as the ABCs of dropout prevention, and the measures are some of the more commonly used early warning indicators. Purpose: Developing and deploying an early warning indicator system (EWIS) is a complex endeavor for school districts, especially smaller districts without access to a large internal research team or experience implementing similar data-oriented initiatives at scale. In this chapter, we describe four key considerations that school districts and others should take account of when designing an EWIS: building broad consensus on the purpose of the system, planning around system design and data availability, validating indicators and setting thresholds, and implementing and monitoring the system. Research Design: This article is based on a review of the relevant literature on designing EWISs and our experiences. We have partnered with multiple districts and states in recent years and advised these organizations on early warning indicator selection, as well as system development. References to the literature are noted where applicable. The omission of references indicates that that portion of the text is based on our experiences working directly with districts and states. Conclusions/Recommendations: Developing early warning indicators--and an EWIS--is a complex technical and human undertaking, akin to implementing a large districtwide initiative at scale. Districts of any size are well served by thinking carefully about the process and going slowly, if needed, to ensure they get the details right. Planning the system and building consensus for implementation, choosing indicators that are right for the district context, and validating and setting the right thresholds for those indicators are essential for building widespread leadership, staff, and community support for the EWIS, as well as developing the conditions for effective implementation and use.},

Title = {Negative Link Prediction to Reduce Dropout in Massive Open Online Courses},

Abstract = {In recent years, the rapid growth of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) has attracted much attention for related research. Besides, one of the main challenges in MOOCs is the high dropout or low completion rate. Early dropout prediction algorithms aim the educational institutes to retain the students for the related course. There are several methods for identification of the resigning students. These methods are often based on supervised machine learning, and require student activity records to train and create a prediction model based on the features extracted from the raw data. The performance of graph-based algorithms in various applications to discover the strong or weak relationships between entities using limited data encouraged us to turn to these algorithms for this problem. Objective of this paper is proposing a novel method with low complexity, negative link prediction algorithm, for the first time, utilizing only network topological data for dropout prediction. The idea is based on the assumption that entities with similar network structures are more likely to establish or remove a relation. Therefore, we first convert the data into a graph, mapping entities (students and courses) to nodes and relationships (enrollment data) to links. Then we use graph-based algorithms to predict students' dropout, utilizing just enrollment data. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves significant performance compared to baseline ones. However, we test the supervised link prediction idea, and show the competitive and promising results in this case as well. Finally, we present important future research directions to improve the results.},

Title = {A Course Recommender System Built on Success to Support Students at Risk in Higher Education},

Abstract = {In this paper, we present an extended evaluation of a course recommender system designed to support students who struggle in the first semesters of their studies and are at risk of dropping out. The system, which was developed in earlier work using a student-centered design, is based on the explainable k-nearest neighbor algorithm and recommends a set of courses that have been passed by the majority of successful neighbors, that is, students who graduated from the study program. In terms of the number of recommended courses, we found a discrepancy between the number of courses that struggling students are recommended to take and the actual number of courses they take. This indicates that there may be an alternative path that these students could consider. However, the recommended courses align well with the courses taken by students who successfully graduated. This suggests that even students who are performing well could still benefit from the course recommender system designed for at-risk students. In the present work, we investigate a second type of success--a specific minimum number of courses passed--and compare the results with our first approach from previous work. With the second type, the information about success might be already available after one semester instead of after graduation which allows faster growth of the database and faster response to curricular changes. The evaluation of three different study programs in terms of dropout risk reduction and recommendation quality suggests that course recommendations based on students passing at least three courses in the following semester can be an alternative to guide students on a successful path.},

Title = {Toward an Institutional Analytics Agenda for Addressing Student Dropout in Higher Education: An Academic Stakeholders' Perspective},

Abstract = {Although the number of students in higher education institutions (HEIs) has increased over the past two decades, it is far from assured that all students will gain an academic degree. To that end, institutional analytics (IA) can offer insights to support strategic planning with the aim of reducing dropout and therefore of minimizing its negative impact (e.g., on students, academic stakeholders, and institutions). However, it is not clear how institutional stakeholders can integrate IA in their practice to overcome academic-related issues and to offer support to students who struggle to achieve their academic goals. To address this gap, we conducted focus groups with 13 institutional stakeholders of an Estonian university. By analyzing the focus group data, we identified three main categories of factors influencing dropout from the perspective of institutional stakeholders: (1) institutional experience, (2) educational goals, and (3) personal aspects. We discuss our findings from an institutional perspective with the aim of reflecting on institutional processes, organizational structures, and facilitatory roles in the context of dropout in higher education (HE). We argue that IA can provide insights into students' institutional experience, educational goals, and personal aspects to further support decision-making on the institutional level. We envision our findings contributing to a participatory agenda for the design, implementation, and integration of IA solutions focusing on addressing dropout in HE.},
