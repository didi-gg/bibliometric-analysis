abstract = {This study presents the development of a novel automated system, Rapid Analysis and Detection of At-risk students with Artificial intelligence-based Response (RADAR), that utilizes explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to identify students who are at risk of falling behind or dropping out of school. The system integrates various features, including learners' personality, previous academic performance, current academic concepts progress, and soft skills. Machine learning algorithms are utilized to analyze the combination of data and identify patterns that predict a student's likelihood of falling behind. The proposed RADAR system employs a multi-modal approach, considering the learner's features. The system is trained on a dataset of students from a school district, where the data is collected and preprocessed accordingly. The feature selection algorithm is applied to identify the most relevant features that can accurately predict students at-risk of falling behind or dropping out. The pilot study establishes the framework of the system and examines the implementation implications. The results of this study indicate that the RADAR system achieves high accuracy in identifying at-risk students. Furthermore, the system effectively employs the identified features to predict students' performance in a continuous manner, enabling advisors, administrators, and students to take proactive measures to maintain high academic progress levels. The system is designed to provide an automated and continuous monitoring of the students' performance, and to notify the relevant parties in case of any deviations. The proposed system represents an innovative approach to using XAI for the detection and support of at-risk students, enabling educators to take timely actions. The results of this study demonstrate the potential of the RADAR system to improve the support and guidance provided to at-risk students, and to ultimately improve their academic outcomes.}

The objective of this study is to examine bullying involvement and adverse childhood experiences as factors associated with school disengagement among children in the US. Data for this study came from the 2016–2017 National Survey of Children’s Health. A sample of 45,041 children ages 6–17 years was analyzed using binary logistic regression with school disengagement as the outcome variable. Based on parent reports, we found that about one-third of the children were disengaged from school, 23% were involved in bullying, and 49.5% experienced at least one childhood adversity. Children who were victims of bullying, were bullies, or were bully-victims were more likely to be disengaged from school. Odds of school disengagement were 1.32 times higher for children with one ACE (95% CI = 1.24–1.40), 1.5 times higher for children with two ACEs (95% CI = 1.38–1.62), and 1.77 times higher for children with three or more ACEs (95% CI = 1.63–1.92). Understanding the association between bullying involvement and adverse childhood experiences as factors associated with school disengagement could help educators utilize supportive and caring relationships to engage students. Such an understanding could also help in developing proactive and preventive interventions to curb bullying in schools and make students feel safe and engaged in classrooms.}

abstract = {Student dropout is a major concern in higher education, as it leads to direct economic losses and substantial social costs. Public and private institutions spend considerable resources to prevent student dropout. The efficiency and effectiveness of these investments, however, may be improved by adopting a profit-driven perspective. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for implementing student dropout prediction using data-driven methods. Extending upon profit metrics as used in business analytics, we design a novel performance measure for evaluating predictive models that is tailored to the student dropout problem and that quantifies the net savings of a retention campaign. This metric supports the identification and selection of students to optimally allocate the limited resources for preventing student dropout and to maximize the resulting savings. Experiments were performed using data from three bachelor's programs of a higher education institution containing information on dropouts and participation in a retention program, i.e., tutorials. The proposed metric allows for a better choice of prediction model and classification threshold than conventional approaches and, as a result, yields tangible savings for the institution. Finally, the presented approach and experimental results highlight pathways to design tailored student retention programs.}

The participants were 2378 elementary school students who completed the Korean Welfare Panel Study at five time points that covered from late elementary school to the first year of high school. Latent Class Growth Analysis identified three truancy trajectories: truancy increasing group, truancy decreasing group, and non-truant group. At the individual level, the truancy increasing group was more likely to be composed of males and have higher levels of game use than non-truants. Both the truancy increasing and decreasing group were more likely to have higher levels of aggression and depression than the non-truant group. At the family level, non-traditional structures and poor parental affection were more associated with the truancy increasing group. At the peer/friend level, the truancy increasing group was more likely to have poor peer relations than the non-truant group or truancy decreasing group, and more likely to have associations with delinquent peers than the non-truant group. At the school level, the truancy increasing group reported being less likely to have positive relations with teachers, to engage in school activities, and to follow school rules than the non-truant group. These findings could allow for more specific and targeted interventions designed to meet the needs and risk factors associated with the different typologies of truants in South Korea.}

The objective of this article is to show the implementation results of a predictive information system (IS) for the prevention of university dropout in a higher education institution. The system allows the calculation of the risk of dropout per student and uses an alert generation procedure to coordinate interventions. The platform allowed measuring the impact of the intervention strategies on the permanence of the students. Likewise, it made possible the reorganization of the intervention process towards the students, prioritizing according to the risk level.}

Multiple student-level factors were associated with increased likelihood of earning a diploma in the fifth year (e.g. special education eligibility, passing exit exams, higher attendance). Returning dropouts were less likely than persisters to earn a diploma in year five. In addition, the type and composition of the school a student attended affected the likelihood that a student would earn a diploma in year five. We also report population-level rates of participation in the workforce and postsecondary enrollment for fifth-year graduates and non-graduates. Fifth-year graduates outperformed non-graduates in both categories. Our findings provide insight into near term outcomes for students in a fifth-year of high school and suggest key factors that can be used for early identification and targeting services towards this under-researched and under-served population.}

abstract = {The dropout rate in universities is a widely studied issue that concerns both universities and public organizations. Most studies focus on quantifying the phenomenon and identifying the variables involved. This paper uses a multidisciplinary approach to parameterize the factors that define the entry profile of undergraduates at the national level in Spain in collaboration with three universities in different regions and with different disciplines. The aim is to reduce the dropout rate in the first year of study towards a degree. The research questions focus on the weighting of personal variables about students by tutors and whether there are differences in the weighting systems for the main variables as differentiated by discipline, university and/or region. The document is organized to describe the method and context of the study, present the main results, show the application of the survey instrument in a case study, and provide conclusions. The method is based on the two fundamental factors, including the influence of certain student characteristics at matriculation and the importance of a positive experience in the first year of the degree. The study is focused on two elements that inspire the current proposal: the need to identify and rapidly detect students who, due to their entry characteristics, are at a greater risk of dropout and the importance of guaranteeing a good start in the first year of the degree. The study uses a multidisciplinary approach and combines qualitative and quantitative methods to gather data. The study also uses a survey instrument that measures the risk of student dropout based on the weighting of personal variables by tutors. The results of the study have allowed us to categorize the main variables of the student profile that affect the risk of dropout and establish them as aspects to be monitored by the tutors in the first weeks. Furthermore, it has been shown that although there are no significant differences in the averages of dropout risk calculated with either global or specific weighting systems (by centre or studies), there is a tendency observed by the tutors that the weighted averages generated by disciplinary focus are closer to identifying the student's real risk of dropping out.}

The research on MOOCs has risen exponentially during the last years and there have been a number of works focused on studying collaboration. However, these previous studies have been restricted to the analysis of collaboration based on the forum and social interactions, without taking into account other possibilities such as the synchronicity in the interactions with the platform. Therefore, in this work we performed a case study with the goal of implementing a data-driven approach to detect and characterize collaboration in MOOCs. We applied an algorithm to detect synchronicity links based on their submission times to quizzes as an indicator of collaboration, and applied it to data from two large Coursera MOOCs. We found three different profiles of user accounts, that were grouped in couples and larger communities exhibiting different types of associations between user accounts. The characterization of these user accounts suggested that some of them might represent genuine online learning collaborative associations, but that in other cases dishonest behaviors such as free-riding or multiple account cheating might be present. These findings call for additional research on the study of the kind of collaborations that can emerge in online settings.}

However, inherent limitations in conventional CMS platforms hinder personalized student guidance and effective identification of academic challenges. Addressing this crucial gap, our study introduces an AI Student Success Predictor empowered by advanced machine learning algorithms, capable of automating grading processes, predicting student risks, and forecasting retention or dropout outcomes. Central to our approach is the creation of a standardized dataset, meticulously curated by integrating student information from diverse relational databases. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) feature learning block is developed the extract the hidden patterns in the student data. This classification model stands as an ensemble masterpiece, incorporating SVM, Random Forest, and KNN classifiers, subsequently refined by a Bayesian averaging model. The proposed ensemble model shows the ability to predict the student grades, retention, and risk levels of dropout. The accuracy achieved by the proposed model is assessed using test data, culminating in a commendable 93% accuracy for student grade prediction and student risk prediction, and a solid 92% accuracy for the complex domain of retention and dropout forecasting. The proposed AI system seamlessly integrates with existing CMS infrastructure, enabling real-time data retrieval and swift, accurate predictions, enhancing academic decision-making efficiency. Our study's pioneering AI Student Success Predictor bridges the chasm between traditional CMS limitations and the growing demands of modern education.}

These processes are sensitive to a broad range of biological and environmental impacts, including physical and mental health conditions, substance use, lifestyle choices, as well as adverse personal and social circumstances. Cognitive control processes and associated prefrontal cortical areas are the last to fully mature during young adulthood, and most sensitive to the effects of age in late life. Moreover, cognitive control ability in early life is predictive of adaptive or maladaptive outcomes in adulthood. The sensitivity of cognitive control processes to many of the influences that impact our lives makes them a prime candidate as an early warning system of the need for assessment and intervention to prevent cascading effects of cognitive decline across multiple contexts and areas of functioning. In this paper, we briefly review current approaches to assessing cognitive control literature, with a particular focus on the task-switching paradigm. We briefly review current designs and measures, its link to prefrontal cortical function and its sensitivity to a broad range of clinical conditions and lifestyle variations. We conclude that the task-switching paradigm may provide a sensitive tool for assessing cognitive control ability across the lifespan, as well as detecting early subtle changes in ability that may be predictive of future negative outcomes and signal the need for intervention. We briefly discuss how the task-switching paradigm could be developed into a powerful “canary in the coalmine.”}

Enhanced student dropout prediction tools would help providers proactively detect students at risk of leaving and identify factors that they might address to help students continue their learning experience. Therefore, this study seeks to improve student dropout predictions, with three main contributions. First, it benchmarks a recently proposed logit leaf model (LLM) algorithm against eight other algorithms, using a real-life data set of 10,554 students of a global subscription-based online learning provider. The LLM outperforms all other methods in finding a balance between predictive performance and comprehensibility. Second, a new multilevel informative visualization of the LLM adds novel benefits, relative to a standard LLM visualization. Third, this research specifies the impacts of student demographics; classroom characteristics; and academic, cognitive, and behavioral engagement variables on student dropout. In reviewing LLM segments, these results show that different insights emerge for various student segments with different learning patterns. This notable result can be used to personalize student retention campaigns.}

Endowed with ever-growing computational power and real-time data, highly scalable AI can increase efficiency and accuracy in leaders’ DIDM. However, misusing AI can have perilous effects on education stakeholders. Many lurking biases in current AI could be amplified. Of more concern, the moral values (e.g., fairness, equity, honesty, and doing no harm) we uphold might clash with using AI to make data-informed decisions. Further, missteps on the issues about data security and privacy could have a life-long impact on stakeholders.

abstract = {Bangladesh is known as a hazard-prone country. Among the hazards, flood is concerned as the most vulnerable and disastrous factor in terms of adverse impact on people’s livelihood and properties. Due to locational disadvantage, particularly at the lower confluence characteristic, it is often severely affected by the wide magnitude of floods. However, the study is intended to discuss the flood intensity and recurrence trend by analyzing historical data. The study also focuses on the indigenous coping techniques of flood-affected people. To access the intensity of the flood, Flood Intensity Index (FII) method was applied. To analyze the flood recurrence and peak, Weibull’s and Gumbel’s distribution method was applied for a period of 36 years (1985–2020), and for ranking the coping strategies, Weight Average Index (WAI) was applied. The research result indicates that the study area poses a higher degree of flood risk (0.642), especially from May to October month. Over the study period, 17 floods took place in the area. Among these, floods in 1988 and 1998 were of very high magnitude, with Flood Intensity Index scores of 24.64 and 31.68, respectively. However, affected people apply different types of indigenous preventive, surviving, and recovering techniques to minimize the adverse effects of floods.}

abstract = {This chapter examines the current state of the field for early warning indicators and intervention systems. These are efforts by schools, districts, state, and nonprofits to use evidence-based indicators of student need and predictors of negative outcomes (i.e., course failure and dropping out of high school) and positive trajectories (i.e., college readiness) to proactively and peremptorily provide additional supports or interventions to change the likely trajectory of the student. Most often associated with dropout prevention, indicator and response systems are now being generalized to also help students to be prepared for and succeed in postsecondary schooling and to have greater success during the elementary school years. This chapter provides a brief history of their development, surveys the existing evidence base of early warning indicators, details their current use of indicator and response systems and their impacts, and then discusses the emerging issues and trends in their future development and use.}

abstract = {In situations like the coronavirus pandemic, colleges and universities are forced to limit their offline and regular academic activities. Extended postponement of high-stakes exams due to health risk hereby reduces productivity and progress in later years. Several countries decided to organize the exams online. Since many other countries with large education boards had an inadequate infrastructure and insufficient resources during the emergency, education policy experts considered a solution to simultaneously protect public health and fully resume high-stakes exams -by canceling offline exam and introducing a uniform assessment process to be followed across the states and education boards. This research proposes a novel system using an AI model to accomplish the complex task of evaluating all students across education boards with maximum level of fairness and analyzes the ability to fairly appraise exam grades in the context of high-stakes examinations during SARS-CoV-2 emergency. Basically, a logistic regression classifier on top of a deep neural network is used to output predictions that are as fair as possible for all learners. The predictions of the proposed grade-awarding system are explained by the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) framework. SHAP allowed to identify the features of the students' portfolios that contributed most to the predicted grades. In the setting of an empirical analysis in one of the largest education systems in the Global South, 81.85% of learners were assigned fair scores while 3.12% of the scores were significantly smaller than the actual grades, which would have had a detrimental effect if it had been applied for real. Furthermore, SHAP allows policy-makers to debug the predictive model by identifying and measuring the importance of the factors involved in the model's final decision and removing those features that should not play a role in the model's “reasoning” process.}

abstract = {Distance education supports lifelong learning and empowers individuals in rapidly changing societal conditions, yet it encounters high dropout rates due to a range of individual and societal obstacles. This study addresses the challenge of creating a practical prediction model by analyzing extensive real-world time-point data from a well-established online university in Seoul. Covering 144,540 instances from 2018 to 2022, the study integrates diverse datasets to compare the accuracy of models based on longitudinal, semester-wise, and gender-specific datasets. The demographic, academic, and online metrics identified significant dropout indicators, including age (particularly when binned), residential area, specific occupations, GPA, and LMS log metrics, using a stepwise backward elimination process. The study revealed that, despite societal changes, recent data from the last four semesters can be effectively used for stable prediction training. Gender-based analysis showed different factors influencing dropout risk for males and females. The Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM) algorithm excelled in prediction accuracy, with the ROC-AUC metric affirming its superiority. However, logistic regression also showed its competitive performance and offered in-depth interpretation. In South Korea's distinct educational setting, merging advanced algorithms like LGBM with the interpretive strength of logistic regression is key for effective student support strategies.}
