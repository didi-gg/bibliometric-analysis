abstract = {The rapid growth of educational data creates the requirement to mine useful information from learning behavior patterns. The development of data mining technology makes educational data mining possible. The paper intends to use a public educational data set to study learning behavior patterns from the perspective of educational data mining, so as to promote the innovation of educational management. Firstly, in order to reduce the dimension of data analysis that facilitates the improvement in efficiency, principal component analysis is carried out to reduce the number of attributes in the data set. The significant attributes in the rotating principal component matrix rather than principal components which are not closely related to learning behavior patterns are extracted as the research variables. Then, a pseudo statistic is proposed to determine the number of clusters and the preprocessed data set is clustered according to the extracted attributes. The clustering results are applied to add class labels to the data, which is convenient for the later data training. Finally, six classification algorithms J48, K-Nearest Neighbor, Bayes Net, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and Logit Boost are used to train the data with labels and build prediction models. At the same time, the performance and applicable conditions of six classifiers in terms of accuracy, efficiency, error, and so on are discussed and compared. It is found that the performance of the integrated algorithm is better than that of a single classifier. In the integrated algorithm, compared with Random Forest, the running time of Logit Boost is shorter.}

abstract = {Educators seek to develop accurate and timely prediction models to forecast student retention and attrition. Although prior studies have generated single point estimates to quantify predictive efficacy, much less education research has examined variability in student performance predictions using nonparametric bootstrap algorithms in data pipelines. In this study, bootstrapping was applied to examine performance variability among five data mining methods (DMMs) and four filter preprocessing feature selection techniques for forecasting course grades for 3225 students enrolled in an undergraduate biology class. While the median area under the curve (AUC) values obtained from bootstrapping were significantly lower than the AUC point estimates obtained without resampling, DMMs and feature selection techniques impacted variability in different ways. The ensemble technique elastic net regression (GLMNET) significantly outperformed all other DMMs and exhibited the least amount of variability in the AUC. However, all filter feature selection techniques significantly increased variability in student success predictions, compared to when this step was omitted from the data pipeline. We discuss the potential benefits and drawbacks of incorporating bootstrapping into prediction pipelines to track, monitor, and forecast classroom performance, as well as highlight the risks of only examining point estimates.}

abstract = {Student Performance Prediction (SPP) has received a lot of attention due to its educational implications, such as personalized instruction. Among numerous attempts in SPP, recommendation-based approaches (e.g. matrix factorization; MF) are especially attractive because of the specialized nature of personalization. However, they commonly struggle with the cold-start problem and incorporating side information. While existing works cope with the problem by utilizing additional information, such as students’ personalities, none of them cover the multimodal auxiliary information that can unleash the full potential of the recommendation-based SPP. In this work, we leverage multimodal auxiliary information at SPP for the first time by adopting large language models (GPT-J and Llama 2) as information blenders to produce extra guidance signals for the MF method. Specifically, our language model-guided matrix factorization (LMgMF), consumes the verbalized multimodal information, produces semantically rich embeddings for educational interaction, and uses them as auxiliary signals for MF. While doing so, we harness a API-level black-box language model without requiring parameter accessibility to adapt them. We evaluate LMgMF on two real-world datasets: (1) a large-scale Korean dataset that contains 1.6M instances from 10K pre-high school students; (2) ASSISTments2009 covering 346K interactions between students and math questions. Throughout extensive validation, we demonstrate that LMgMF consistently outperforms baseline methods in various SPP scenarios, including the cold-start.}

Analyzing the educational data generated through these resources has become a challenging task. But all the educational data in its various formats are helpful for educational institutes to improve teaching–learning methodology, employability, student retention, and to make optimal decisions for the success of the institute. We provide a new technique in this study inspired by the teaching–learning-based optimization algorithm to optimize feature selection methods. We have successfully found the optimal set of features and evaluated them using different machine learning algorithms. It is observed that, based on the dataset, Gradient Boosting Classifier, Decision Tree Classifier, Support Vector Classifier, Adaptive Boosting, and XGB Classifier have outperformed other classification methods like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and K Nearest Neighbor Classifier. By testing the proposed methodology with Gradient Boosting Classifier, the AUC score improved by 10% and in Decision Tree Classifier by 27% compared to the model tested without the proposed feature selection method. Based on these results, we have concluded that student performance prediction depends on current academic record, past results, attendance, and socio–demographic factors.}

abstract = {Learning Analytics aims to discover the class of students' performance over time. This helps instructors make in-time interventions but, discovering the students' performance class in virtual learning environments consider a challenge due to distance constraints. Many studies, which applied to Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) datasets, built predictive models but, these models were applied to specific courses and students and classify students into binary classes. Moreover, their results were obtained at the end of the course period thus delaying making in-time interventions. To bridge this gap, this study proposes a day-wise multi-class model to predict students’ performance using Artificial Neural Network and Long Short-Term Memory, named ANN-LSTM. To check the validity of this model, two baseline models, the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), were conducted and compared with ANN-LSTM in this context. Additionally, the results of ANN-LSTM were compared with the state-of-the-art models in terms of accuracy. The results show that the ANN-LSTM model obtained the best results among baseline models. The accuracy obtained by ANN-LSTM was about 70% at the end of the third month of the course and outperforms RNN and GRU models which obtained 53% and 57%, respectively. Also, the ANN-LSTM model obtained the best accuracy results with enhancement rates of about 6–14% when compared with state-of-the-art models. This highlights the ability of LSTM as a time series model to make early predictions for student performance in MOOC taking benefit of its architecture and ability to keep latent dependencies.}

Predictions can be made by using data stored in an academic information system on students' behavior related to taking courses that are an important part of a higher education institute with a coherent vertical curriculum. A student's course-taking behavior can be used as an indicator of their potential performance by investigating the alignment of their course-taking activities with curriculum guidelines. Domain knowledge is also considered as a variable due to the varying compositions of courses in curriculum guidelines. Past performance also needs to be taken into consideration. The result of the prediction can be used to help academic stakeholders take actions such as intervening to ensuring that students graduate on time.

The first dataset contains variables obtained prior to the start of the school year, and the second included academic variables collected two months after the semester began. Classification models based on the Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) were created to predict academic outcomes of student performance at the end of the school year for each dataset. Results showed that, though the attributes ‘grades' and ‘absences' were the most relevant for predicting the end of the year academic outcomes of student performance, the analysis of demographic attributes reveals that ‘neighborhood’, ‘school’ and ‘age’ are also potential indicators of a student's academic success or failure.}

abstract = {The early prediction of students' performance is a valuable resource to improve their learning. If we are able to detect at-risk students in the initial stages of the course, we will have more time to improve their performance. Likewise, excellent students could be motivated with customized additional activities. This is why there are research works aimed to early detect students’ performance. Some of them try to achieve it with the analysis of LMS log files, which store information about student interaction with the LMS. Many works create predictive models with the log files generated for the whole course, but those models are not useful for early prediction because the actual log information used for predicting is different to the one used to train the models. Other works do create predictive models with the log information retrieved at the early stages of courses, but they are just focused on a particular type of course. In this work, we use machine learning to create models for the early prediction of students' performance in solving LMS assignments, by just analyzing the LMS log files generated up to the moment of prediction. Moreover, our models are course agnostic, because the datasets are created with all the University of Oviedo1 courses for one academic year. We predict students' performance at 10%, 25%, 33% and 50% of the course length. Our objective is not to predict the exact student's mark in LMS assignments, but to detect at-risk, fail and excellent students in the early stages of the course. That is why we create different classification models for each of those three student groups. Decision tree, nave Bayes, logistic regression, multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network, and support vector machine models are created and evaluated. Accuracies of all the models grow as the moment of prediction increases. Although all the algorithms but nave Bayes show accuracy differences lower than 5%, MLP obtains the best performance: from 80.1% accuracy when 10% of the course has been delivered to 90.1% when half of it has taken place. We also discuss the LMS log entries that most influence the students' performance. By using a clustering algorithm, we detect six different clusters of students regarding their interaction with the LMS. Analyzing the interaction patterns of each cluster, we find that those patterns are repeated in all the early stages of the course. Finally, we show how four out of those six student-LMS interaction patterns have a strong correlation with students' performance.}

The shear nonlinearity of T800 carbon fiber-reinforced epoxy-based plain-woven composites are investigated by carrying out in-plane shear experiments, and the data sets considering temperature effects are established accordingly. Compared with traditional constitutive models, the proposed ML-based model excels in predicting shear nonlinearity, even at temperatures not included in the training set. The integration of this ML-based constitutive model into the finite element (FE) simulation framework achieves high consistency between simulation and experimental results, thereby validating the significant application of ML in complex material behavior modeling and FE analysis.}

Importantly, an additional measure of prediction confidence can be useful in this regard to decide the magnitude of the assistance required. The primary objective of this study is to predict the failure, degradation and improvement before course commencement. A real dataset containing nearly 0.6 million records is used here for this purpose. We have initially applied multiple state-of-the-art classifiers on this dataset to predict the performance in binary terms. Unfortunately, these classifiers could not perform well, and they are unable to provide the desired prediction confidence as well. We have therefore proposed a novel scalable algorithm, named random wheel, for classification. It not only works efficiently on this dataset but also works well with other benchmarked datasets. The proposed classifier provides an additional measure to indicate the prediction confidence. It, in turn, increases the acceptability of the prediction.}

A lot of research has been dedicated to specific machine learning applications for specific phases of a building's life-cycle. The reviews commonly take a specific, technological perspective without a vision for the integration of smart technologies at the level of the whole system. Especially, there is a lack of discussion on the roles of autonomous AI agents and training environments for boosting the learning process in complex and abruptly changing operational environments. This review article discusses the learning ability of buildings with a system-level perspective and presents an overview of autonomous machine learning applications that make independent decisions for building energy management. We conclude that the buildings’ adaptability to unpredicted changes can be enhanced at the system level through AI-initiated learning processes and by using digital twins as training environments. The greatest potential for energy efficiency improvement is achieved by integrating adaptability solutions at the timescales of HVAC control and electricity market participation.}

abstract = {Increasing numbers of higher education institutions see themselves as service providers, catering primarily to the needs of its students. The improvement of student performance is a top priority for universities. It is critical to first assess the present situation of the students before designing a program to improve their performance. Higher education administrators face a significant problem in predicting a student's future success. The goal of this study is to learn what factors influence college students' decision on a major. It will be possible to forecast students' behavior, attitudes, and performance with the use of predictive tools and procedures. Predicting student performance ahead of time makes it possible to take proactive measures to raise achievement levels. To obtain a high education standard, several attempts have been made to forecast student performance. However the accuracy of these predictions falls short of the desired level of excellence. Machine learning approaches including Artificial Neural Network, Nave Bayes, and SVM are being studied. A University Data Set from UCI Machinery is used in the experimental investigation.}

abstract = {The proactive prediction and systematic classification of students' academic performance empower educational administrators with the invaluable capability to not only pinpoint potential challenges but also to craft targeted strategies and interventions that are tailored to the unique needs of students. This multifaceted approach enables educational institutions to proactively address issues within the education system, fostering a more equitable and effective learning environment for all, while simultaneously fostering a culture of continuous improvement and accountability in the pursuit of educational excellence. Hence, the current investigation aims to classify and predict the students' performance by examining and comparing the machine learning and artificial neural network assessments. Five methods of the Random Forest Classifier, the Decision Tree Classifier, the K Neighbors Classifier, the MLP Classifier, and the XG-Boost Classifier are used. These methods' performances are compared through the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score indicators. This comparison is applied to the base data and balanced data, which is carried out by the SVM-SMOTE technique. Finally, five metaheuristic algorithms are applied to the selected method to evaluate the performance indicators of the hybrid models. The results indicate that applying the SVM-SMOTE technique improves the methods' performance, in which the XG-Boost represented the best performance. As a result, the metaheuristic algorithms are applied to the XG-Boost, yielding to 9.33%, 8.44%, 9.33%, and 9.27% enhancement of the Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1-Score values. Subsequently, the Enhanced Artificial Ecosystem-Based Optimization + XG-Boost hybrid method provides the accuracy and F1-score values of 0.9417 and 0.9413. These results underscore the potential of combining machine learning techniques with metaheuristic algorithms to enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of predicting and classifying students' performance, thus providing valuable insights for educational administrators to address issues and improve the education system.}

Many institutions are focused on improving the performance and the education quality; and this can be achieved by utilizing data mining techniques to analyze and predict students’ performance and to determine possible factors that may affect their final marks. To address this issue, this work starts by thoroughly exploring and analyzing two different datasets at two separate stages of course delivery (20% and 50% respectively) using multiple graphical, statistical, and quantitative techniques. The feature analysis provides insights into the nature of the different features considered and helps in the choice of the machine learning algorithms and their parameters. Furthermore, this work proposes a systematic approach based on Gini index and p-value to select a suitable ensemble learner from a combination of six potential machine learning algorithms. Experimental results show that the proposed ensemble models achieve high accuracy and low false positive rate at all stages for both datasets.}

Unfortunately, not all pilot candidates successfully complete the necessary training requirements to become fully qualified Air Force pilots, which wastes critical time and resources and only further exacerbates the pilot shortage problem. Therefore, it is important for the Air Force to carefully consider whom they select to attend pilot training. This research examines historical specialized undergraduate pilot training (SUPT) candidate data leveraging a variety of machine learning techniques to obtain insights on candidate success. Computational experimentation is performed to determine how selected machine learning techniques and their respective hyperparameters affect solution quality. Results reveal that the extremely randomized tree machine learning technique can achieve nearly 94% accuracy in predicting candidate success. Additional analysis indicates degree type and commissioning source are the most important features in determining candidate success. Ultimately, this research can inform the modification of future SUPT candidate selection criteria and other related Air Force personnel policies.}

Although identifying the role of entrepreneurship orientation as a critical success factor in project performance has been considered as an important issue, it is also important to develop a measurement system for predicting performance based on the degree of an individual's entrepreneurial orientation. In this study, we use predictive analytics by proposing a machine learning approach to predict individuals' project performance based on measures of several aspects of entrepreneurial orientation and entrepreneurial attitude of the individuals. We investigated this relationship using a sample of 185 observations and a range of machine learning algorithms including lasso, ridge, support vector machines, neural networks, and random forest. Our results showed that the best method for predicting project performance is lasso. After identifying the best predictive model, we then used the Bayesian Information Criterion and the Akaike Information Criterion to identify the most significant factors. Our results identify all three aspects of entrepreneurial attitude (social self-efficacy, appearance self-efficacy, and comparativeness) and one aspect of entrepreneurial orientation (proactiveness) as the most important factors. This study contributes to the relationship between entrepreneurship skills and project performance and provides insights into the application of emerging tools in data science and machine learning in operations management and project management research.}

Simultaneously, these studies emphasised the importance of the input data quality, its precise pre-processing and thoroughly selected features on final performance metrics of the applied classification algorithms. However, the stand-alone application of well-known classification algorithms still has performance limitations, which can be outperformed using ensembles of classifiers. Therefore, this paper aims to evaluate the overall contribution of the selected ensemble methods to the early prediction of students at risk of dropping out of learning courses. All phases of CRISP-DM methodology are described in this study to explain the complexity of the problem of the practical adoption of voting-based heterogeneous ensemble methods in the case of data obtained from the course of the university learning management system compared to traditional classification algorithms enhanced by ensemble learning with AdaBoost and XGBoost methods. As a result, the study confirmed that the features which characterise the students’ performance and their interactions in the course can be considered the most significant for the identification of the students at risk of dropping out. Moreover, in the case of advanced ensemble algorithms, the overall accuracy, recall, precision, and f1 score were improved by 2-4%. The proposed method has demonstrated exceptional performance. Finally, the paper summarises the findings and their implications for effective prediction.}

Leveraging the data-rich environment of the interactive learning management system proposed earlier, this study focuses on training a predictive model that forecasts student grades based on the comprehensive data collected during the teaching process. The proposed model capitalizes on the data obtained from students' engagement patterns, time spent on exercises, and progress tracking across learning activities. This study compared five different base classifiers— Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naïve Bayes (NB), and k-nearest Neighbor (k-NN), and an ensemble learning method Stacking Classifier —utilizing a dataset comprising 13 features. The research assesses the model's accuracy, reliability, and implications, contributing to the evolution of educational evaluation by introducing predictive assessment as a transformative tool. The results indicate that the Stacking Classifier accurately predicts students' grade ranges, surpassing individual base classification models by effectively combining their predictive capabilities. Integrating data-driven forecasting into the educational ecosystem can transform teaching methodologies and foster an informed, engaged, and empowered learning environment. This approach cultivates a proactive learning community by empowering students with real-time academic progress forecasts.

We wanted to find out the emerging technologies used in computing education, its evaluation and effectiveness, and limitations and gaps for future research. We carried out a Systematic Literature Review study on the use of Emerging Technologies in higher education computing education to identify the state of the art in the use of these three groups of technologies for assessment and feedback practices. After systematic search and filtering from a search pool of 3038 studies published between 2016 and 2021, we selected 38 articles for detailed meta-analysis. Our findings reveal that 71% of the reviewed studies are journal articles, 50% studies focus on learning analytics, and the majority of the studies employ quantitative approaches. The results from this systematic review suggest that XR technologies have received least attention to date in computing education (amongst the emerging technologies considered for the review) and there is a lack of frameworks for design, evaluation and use of emerging technologies in higher education. The findings of this review will be beneficial for researchers and educators to obtain an in-depth understanding of the main areas of application of emerging technologies in higher education computing education, an inventory of emerging technology tools used for assessment and feedback, effectiveness indicators, and evaluation approaches that have been used. For evidence-based guidance on future assessment and feedback practices using emerging technologies, we also present a brief research agenda, drawing attention to the need to trial more XR, focus on formative assessment and feedback practices, better understand impact of human-centric issues and take more thoughtful consideration of ethics in the use of emerging technologies in computing education.}

The integration of both unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques has demonstrated significant efficacy in predicting student performance. This paper explores the application of different machine learning methods in predicting student academic performance. Initially, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was utilised to reduce the dataset’s dimensionality, thereby improving its visualisation. Subsequently, K-Means clustering was employed to segregate students into distinct groups, reflective of their learning behaviors. Afterwards, the observed clusters were utilised for training classification models to address each student cluster individually. This approach was implemented in a case study involving an undergraduate science course at a North American University (NAU) and the Open University Learning Analytics Dataset (OULAD). Empirical findings indicate that the combined use of Feedforward Dense Network (FDN), Random Forest (RF), and Decision Tree (DT), specifically in their clustered forms, outperforms other classifiers in predicting student academic performance effectively.}

To accurately predict college students' sports performance and motivate them to improve their physical fitness, this study constructs a sports achievement prediction system by using a U-Net Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) in machine learning. Firstly, the current state of physical education teachers’ instructional proficiency is investigated and analyzed to identify existing problems. Secondly, an improved U-Net-based sports achievement prediction system is proposed. This method enhances the utilization and propagation of network features by incorporating dense connections, thus addressing gradient disappearance issues. Simultaneously, an improved mixed loss function is introduced to alleviate class imbalance. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed system is validated through testing, demonstrating that the improved U-Net CNN algorithm yields superior results. Specifically, the prediction accuracy of the improved network for sports performance surpasses that of the original U-Net by 4.22 % and exceeds that of DUNet by 5.22 %. Compared with other existing prediction networks, the improved U-Net CNN model exhibits a superior achievement prediction ability. Consequently, the proposed system enhances teaching and learning efficiency and offers insights into applying artificial intelligence technology to smart classroom development.}

This paper also talks about the circumstantial origin of these algorithms, which although has been rarely talked about in previous publications, is a preeminent point of discussion for ML enthusiasts and amateurs, both. To explain and understand the accuracy, robustness, and reliability of the algorithms, they were exhaustively reviewed and researched in all aspects qualitatively and quantitatively, wherein the LSTM network and SVM algorithm have projected a superior behavior over the rest. The paper answers all relevant questions that may arise during the study of these algorithms ranging from their origin, to their definition, methodologies of execution, real-time applications attached with sufficient novel evidence, followed by the advantages and major trade-offs; lastly an elaborate comparison of their performances on quantitative and qualitative grounds has been presented. To conclude, the paper also highlights the future scope of ML algorithms and artificial intelligence in the coming times and their roles in automation and holistic development, not just in technology-related aspects but also, the humanitarian aspects, finally followed by reliable and relevant conclusions derived from this exhaustive research.}

abstract = {Academic performance prediction is a fundamental and hot issue in educational data mining (EDM). Recently, researchers have proposed a series of effective machine learning (ML) based classification strategies to predict students’ academic performance. However, prior arts are typically concerned about individual models but neglect the association among students, which might considerably have an effect on the integrity of the academic performance-related representations. Meanwhile, students’ multi-viewing behavior contains complex relations among students. Therefore, we propose a Multi-View Hypergraph Neural Network (MVHGNN) for predicting students’ academic performance. MVHGNN uses hypergraphs to construct high-order relations among students. The semantic information implied by multiple behaviors is consolidated through meta-paths. Further, a Cascade Attention Transformer (CAT) module is introduced to mine the weight of different behaviors by the self-attention mechanism. Our method is evaluated on real campus student behavioral datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art ones.}

Virtual Reality Training Systems (VRTS) provide an affordable and safe alternative for training in such high risk environments. However, their effectiveness relies mainly on having meaningful activities for supporting learning and on their ability to detect untrained students. This study builds a student model based on Learning Analytics (LA), using data collected from 1399 students that used a VRTS for the maintenance training of lineworkers in 329 courses carried out from 2008 to 2016. By employing several classifiers, the model allows discriminating between trained and untrained students in different maneuvers using three minimum evaluation proficiency scores. Using the best classifier, a Feature Importance Analysis is carried out to understand the impact of the variables regarding the trainees’ final performances. The model also involves the exploration of the trainees’ trace data through a visualization tool to pose non-observable behavioral variables related to displayed errors. The results show that the model can discriminate between trained and untrained students, the Random Forest algorithm standing out. The feature importance analysis revealed that the most relevant features regarding the trainees’ final performance were profile and course variables along with specific maneuver steps. Finally, using the visual tool, and with human expert aid, several error patterns in trace data associated with misconceptions and confusion were identified. In the light of these, LA enables disassembling the data jigsaw quandary from VRTS to enhance the human-in-the-loop evaluation.}

abstract = {The student academic performance prediction is becoming an indispensable service in the computer supported intelligent education system. But conventional machine learning-based methods can only exploit the sparse discriminative features of student behaviors in imbalanced academic datasets to predict student academic performance (SAP). Furthermore, there is a lack of imbalanced data processing mechanisms that can efficiently capture student characteristics and achievement. Therefore, we propose a comprehensive and high-performance prediction framework to probe SAP characteristics (ProbSAP) on massive educational data, which can resolve imbalanced data issue and improve academic prediction performance for making course final mark prediction. It consists of three main components: collaborative data processing module for enhancing the data quality, scalable metadata clustering module for alleviating the imbalance of academic features, and XGBoost-enhanced SAP prediction module for academic performance forecasting. The collaborative data processing module integrates multi-dimensional academic data, which sustains a good supply for clustering and modeling in the ProbSAP framework. The comparative evaluation results demonstrate that ProbSAP delivers superior accuracy and efficiency improvement for the course final mark prediction of college students over other state-of-the-art methods such as CNN, SVR, RFR, XGBoost, Catboost-SHAP, and AS-SAN. On average, ProbSAP reduces the mean absolute error (MAE) by 84.76%, 72.11%, and 66.49% compared with XGBoost, Catboost-SHAP, and AS-SAN, respectively. It also leads to a better out-sample fit that minimizes prediction errors between 1% and 9% with over 98% of actual samples.}

Early warning systems can help by identifying both at-risk and high-performing students, allowing for timely interventions and enhanced learning opportunities. In our study, we used a year's worth of data from an information management school to build predictive models for two binary classification problems: identifying at-risk students and high-performing students. We employed traditional machine learning classifiers and long-short term memory units (LSTM), testing them at various stages of course completion. The best performance was achieved using all course data, with an AUC of 0.756 for at-risk students and 78.2% accuracy for high-performing students using Random Forest and Extremely Randomized Trees, respectively. We found that early prediction was possible as early as 25% course completion. Although LSTM showed inferior performance, it offered practical advantages for early prediction. Our findings suggest that static LMS logs can be reliable indicators of student success early in a course, and a course-agnostic time-dependent representation of the number of clicks can offer a worthwhile tradeoff between predictive performance and simplicity in implementation in some instances. These findings have important implications as they suggest the potential for automated early warning systems that can help educators identify students of interest and allocate resources where they are most needed. However, implementing these systems in real-time requires clear protocols and responsible policies. Further research should explore the generalizability of findings across different contexts and continuously evaluate their real-world effectiveness.}

abstract = {To address the demands of modern education and increase flexibility, many higher education institutions are considering self-paced education programs. However, student retention is yet a widely recognized challenge faced in self-paced education. While many studies have examined the potential of the use of data about student interaction with learning technologies to predict student success, studies that focus on self-paced education are scarce. To address this gap in the literature, this paper reports on the findings of a study that has investigated the performance of a well-known deep learning technique i.e., Long Short-term Memory (LSTM), in the prediction of students at risk of failing a course offered in a self-paced mode of online education. The study has utilized a freely accessible Open University Learning Analytics Dataset comprising 22,437 students with 69 % pass, and 31 % failed instances. The deep LSTM shows the highest predictive power to classify between pass and fail students, compared to all other alternatives by achieving an accuracy of 84.57 %, precision of 82.24 % and recall of 79.43 %. Interestingly, with only first five weeks of course activity log data used for training, the receiver operating characteristic based diagnostic accuracy of the LSTM algorithm is achieved up to 71 %, that outperforms almost all other conventional algorithms - despite trained on the complete dataset collected for the entire duration of the course i.e. up to 38 weeks. Furthermore, this study has also employed a shapely additive explanation model to identify the most important predictors of student retention, e.g., assessment submission and attempted quizzes. This approach is essential in order to increase the interpretability of deep learning techniques and, thus, increase their potential to generate actionable insights.}

This could be owing to the fact that the two fields exhibit common thematic elements. One avenue to provide clarity, uniformity, and consistency around the two fields, is to identify similarities and differences in topics between the two evolving fields. This paper conducted a topic modeling analysis of articles related to educational data mining and learning analytics to reveal thematic features of the two fields. Specifically, we employed structural topic modeling to identify the topics of the two fields from the abstracts. We apply structural topic modeling on N=192 articles for educational data mining and N=489 articles for learning analytics. We infer five-topic models for both educational data mining and learning analytics. We find that while there appears to be disciplinary differences in terms of research focus, there is little support for a clear distinction between the two disciplines, beyond their different lineage. The trend points to a convergence within the field of educational research on the applications of advanced statistical learning techniques to extract actionable insights from large data streams for optimizing teaching and learning. Both fields have converged on an increasing focus on student behaviors over the last five years.}

This article proposes a grammatical evolution-based feature selection and construction method for radial basis function (RBF) networks that predict students’ future grades and study duration based on past courses’ data. The proposed method was compared with Levenberg–Marquardt back-propagation (LM-BP), Broyden, Fletcher, Goldfarb, and Shanno back-propagation (BFGS-BP), stochastic gradient descent (SGD), RBF-based neural network (RBFNN), decision tree (DT), Bayesian network (BN), support vector machine (SVM), and neural network construction (NNC) existing machine learning methods in twelve regression datasets (six for predicting future grades and six for predicting study duration). The datasets contained entries from the physics, philosophy, primary education history, mathematics, and chemistry departments at the University of Ioannina. The experiments showed that it managed to get the lowest mean square error in nine out of twelve regression problems. The experimental study also compared the proposed method with the LM-BP, BFGS-BP, SGD, RBFNN, SVM, and NNC methods in twelve classification datasets (six for predicting future grades and six for predicting study duration) from the same departments. The experimental results on all classification problems showed that the proposed method got the highest accuracy in all datasets. The proposed method can be expanded with other faculties’ and universities’ data forming a complete application usable by universities worldwide.}

With the current development of science and technology, big data is emphasized as the most significant technology in data analysis. From the recorded educational data, efficient prediction of students' dropout is currently a hot topic of research. Previous studies have focused only on the students' dropout based on specific levels such as individual, middle school, and university level. However, ensemble learning approaches have not received much research attention so far to predict students' dropout in university classes based on rare datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel stacking ensemble based on a hybrid of Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Gradient Boosting (GB), and Feed-forward Neural Networks (FNN) to predict student's dropout in university classes. On the dataset collected from 2016 to 2020 at Constantine the Philosopher University in Nitra, the proposed method has demonstrated greater performance when compared with the base models using testing accuracy and the area under the curve (AUC) evaluation metrics under the same conditions. Based on the findings of this study, students at the risk of dropping out the school can be identified based on influential factors and different agents of education can refer to this information for early intervention in the uncontrolled behavior that can lead to the risk of dropping out and take proactive precautionary measures before the issue arise.}

Datasets 1 to 9 is the datasets of students' result in first attempt while datasets 10 to 19 represent datasets of students after passing all courses of semesters and datasets 20 to 29 is overall dataset of students' result analysis. To predict the course-wise, semester-wise and year-wise performance of students, we developed a framework titled as ECSYAPPS (Educational Course Semester Year-wise Academic Performance Prediction System) based on classification techniques and designed algorithm for analyzing students' performance in education sector. This ECSYAPPS predicts the course-wise, semester-wise and year-wise grade of students. Fifteen classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression (LR), Naive Bayes (NB), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Linear Support Vector Classification (LSVC), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Gradient Boosting (GB), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), Bagging, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Light Gradient-Boosting Machine (LightGBM), Categorical Boosting (CatBoost), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier (SGDC) are selected and applied on 29 datasets and compared on basis of performance parameters such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). These fifteen classification algorithms are under ten classifiers such as Linear Model, Naive Bayes, Tree, Support Vector Machine, Nearest Neighbors, Ensemble, xgboost, lightgbm, Discriminant Analysis and catboost. If the accuracy of two more classification algorithms for a dataset is same then in that case Precision, Recall, F1-score and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) are compared for deciding the best classification algorithm for the dataset. In this way, best classification algorithm is selected for each of 29 datasets. It is found that classifiers xgboost works best for eleven datasets while ensemble techniques Gradient Boosting and AdaBoost work best for two datasets and six datasets respectively among 29 datasets. Other classification algorithms such as Decision Tree, LightGBM, LDA, and KNN are noted to be best classification algorithm for two, four, three, and two datasets respectively. This framework is tested on new eight datasets related to students' result two methods such as K-Fold Cross-validation and Train-Validation-Test method. The results of this framework on new datasets shows that accuracy obtained on test dataset or validation dataset as compared to the accuracy obtained on old dataset is less than 6%. This framework will be helpful for students as well instructor. For students, it will help them to improve the performance of difficult courses from students'point of view in the examination while faculty can use this framework to improve pedagogical practices.}

Several motivational variables are analyzed to determine their effect on student performance. We use a machine-learning classifier to compare two approaches: 1) The benchmark study, which uses data from the same academic year for both training and testing; and 2) a prospective study, which focuses on extrapolating a model trained on the previous fall semester to predict outcomes for the upcoming fall semester. We categorize the motivational variables, including time management and event-occurrence frequency. The window-expansion strategy is adopted to enhance performance through periodic evaluation to facilitate timely intervention. Consequently, the prospective approach is consistent with the benchmark results, thus demonstrating its generalizability across academic years and student populations. This approach is promising for identifying at-risk students in the BL course early. The Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) method emphasizes the importance of time-management variables, particularly study in time, for identifying at-risk students. This study enhances our understanding of early detection methods for at-risk students. By analyzing time-related behaviors, we establish a robust foundation for data-driven decisions to improve future BL implementations as well as support motivation and self-regulated learning practices.}

abstract = {Adaptive learning seeks to create personalized learning experiences by considering various cognitive and affective factors. However, conventional adaptive models often fall short in meeting diverse learner needs, relying heavily on single factors like learning style. In response, we present a comprehensive framework that integrates an AI-based adaptive learning model, which not only accounts for multiple factors such as prior performance, leisure interests, and learning style but also aligns with principles of green smart education. Leveraging the k-means clustering algorithm, our approach brings together learners with similar leisure interests. Predicting student performance involves a Gradient Boosting Regressor, with demographic data and past performance contributing to a performance metric. Additionally, our system incorporates sustainability practices, optimizing resource usage in computation and data storage to promote eco-friendliness in education. Artificial neural networks predict individual learning styles, and a decision tree algorithm personalizes educational content delivery to align with preferences. Our objective is twofold: to enhance the overall performance of the proposed model and to champion sustainability in education, fostering a greener and more adaptive learning ecosystem.}

The developed prediction models classified students as either those who were likely to receive a distinctive or those who were likely to be at-risk or withdraw from the class. Although, the early prediction aid in the targeting of educational interventions and achieved a more efficient allocation of educational resources. All proposed solutions fell within the scope of predictions that result in active or proactive actions to support universities and learners. On the other hand, they fail to comprehend the various forms of education systems and whether it appropriate for the twenty-first century and future generations. The paper classifies education into five types based on the design mode, the scope of production, and the interaction between learners and educational systems (Push, Pull, coupling, Integrated, and Sustainable). The paper proposes a sustainable education paradigm that maximizes the knowledge and skill matrix accumulated for the desired program. The proposed theory implementation phases are modelled and demonstrated using 21st-century technologies, such as personalized and coaching education based on the learner’s learning style and remediation actions for strong learners with innovative competencies. The study emphasized various aspects of sustainable education systems that are required for smart city transition. The limitations and proposed solutions for dealing with anticipated issues were demonstrated, and the benefits of sustainable education are based on the proposed maximization theory rather than the current block-based learning of outcomes.}

abstract = {Institutions of higher learning are currently facing the challenging task of attracting new students who can effectively meet their diverse academic demands. With these demands come the need for those institutions to develop strategies that can enhance students' learning experiences at various educational levels. Predicting the academic success at an early stage would allow academic institutions to develop specific enrolment guidelines while avoiding poor performance. The main purpose of this study was to predict the academic performance of students, their cumulative grade point average (CGPA) in particular, at postgraduate levels (e.g., master’s degree), using and comparing different machine learning (ML) algorithms. This work uses a real dataset of 635 master’s students collected from the college of graduate studies of a reputable private university in Malaysia. The predictive model’s goodness-of-fitness is determined using the coefficient of determination R2, which indicates the percentage of the variance in the dependent variables. The mean square error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) are used to evaluate the model’s performance, by identifying discrepancies between the predicted CGPA and the actual CGPA. Of the six different ML models applied, our results showed that the artificial neural network (ANN) model has the best performance, achieving 89% of the variation in the CGPA of the students, with a training error of only 0.06 CGPA points and a prediction error of 0.08 CGPA points. The Gaussian process regression (GPR) model with squared exponential kernel algorithm achieved 71% of the CGPA variation. The model achieved 0.095 CGPA points for both training and evaluation errors. Exploring other variables such as research activities, marital status, and living conditions would have improved the overall accuracy of the proposed ML models. Therefore, future investigations should focus on predicting the academic performance of larger numbers of postgraduates (i.e., PhD and Masters) using different predictive variables and AI models.}

abstract = {Knowledge tracing is a modeling method of students’ knowledge mastery. The deep knowledge tracing (DKT) model uses long short-term memory (LSTM) to process the sequence data of students exercises. However, the LSTM-based model pays more attention to the short-term response status of students while ignoring the long-term learning process. Moreover, existing graph-based knowledge tracing models focus on the static relationship between exercises and skills, ignoring the dynamic graphs formed by students exercises in a session. In this work, we propose a novel knowledge tracing model which is based on an exercise session graph, named session graph based knowledge tracing (SGKT). The session graph is used to model the students’ answering process. In addition, a relationship graph is used to model the relationship between exercises and skills. Then we use gated graph neural networks to obtain the students’ knowledge state from the session graph and use graph convolutional networks to obtain the embedding representations of exercises and skills in the relationship graph. Next, through the interaction mechanism, multiple interaction states composed of knowledge states and embedding representations are obtained. The attention mechanism is used to find the focus from these states and make predictions. Experiments are conducted on three publicly available datasets and the results show that our approach has advantages over some existing baseline methods.}

Thus, this study uses EDM techniques to analyze the performance of higher secondary students in Bangladesh. Three crucial categories, such as good, average, and poorly-performing students are considered for analysis. Four significant aspects of students' performance are emphasized for evaluation in this study. Firstly, predicting students' academic final examination performance in terms of internal college examination. Secondly, identifying all subjects' impact on classifier performance. Thirdly, examining students' performance progression during their studies and relating with subject-wise improvement or degradation. Fourthly, discovering consistent patterns of students' performance based on previous internal examination performance trends. The classification result reveals the correlation between internal examination and final academic performance. In addition, it resembles the predictor subjects for academic performance. The result also highlights the consistent pattern of students' consecutive internal examinations' performance. Thereafter, college administration can take necessary supportive initiatives for poorly-performing students and encourage good-performer students to continue excelling.}

Interpretability makes it easy for the stakeholders to understand the working of these models and adaptability makes it easy to use the same model for multiple cohorts and courses in educational institutions. Recently, some models in learning analytics are constructed with the consideration of interpretability but their interpretability is not quantified. However, adaptability is not specifically considered in this domain. This paper presents a new framework based on hybrid statistical fuzzy theory to overcome these limitations. It also provides explainability in the form of rules describing the reasoning behind a particular output. The paper also discusses the system evaluation on a benchmark dataset showing promising results. The measure of explainability, fuzzy index, shows that the model is highly interpretable. This system achieves more than 82% recall in both the classification and the context adaptation stages.}

As higher education becomes increasingly common and important, finding the best ways to help students optimize their studies is vital. Questionnaires gathered data on student behaviours and achievement from five classes within a semester, constraining variability to compare learning activities directly. The questionnaire captured engagement, psychological factors, effort, course load, time management, and performance data. Statistical and exploratory analysis investigated the dataset. A multilayer perceptron model was developed, using backpropagation and cross-validation to optimize predictive accuracy. The model identified class attendance, sleep quality, and questioning during lectures as most correlated with high grades. Additional patterns emerged around research participation, motivation, cramming, and theoretical studying. This research demonstrates new techniques for associating detailed study behaviours with academic achievement through strictly controlled student data collection and the application of artificial neural networks for predictive modelling. The constrained variability in the dataset allows for isolating the impact from specific learning activities. The controlled student data and machine learning-driven predictive modelling provide information on the optimal grouping of student effort across engagement, health, and studying factors.}

It is important to build a DL-based, fine-grained student performance prediction model to predict students’ outcomes and learning status at every stage of their course, rather than merely predicting the students’ final score and drop-out rate, which is referred to as coarse-grained performance. In this paper, we tackle the problem of fine-grained student performance prediction in an online course using DL-based long sequence generation by formulating the students’ feature as a matrix where elements in certain parts are missing. We propose an adaptive sparse self-attention network to generate the missing values and simultaneously predict the fine-grained performance. The matrix representation of the features facilitates position-wise feature selection, which helps to find the most correlated components from the past learning stage, leading to an embedding with both the original features and their spatial relationships. We build a deep neural network model with several sparse self-attention layers stacked together to achieve sequence generation. Experimental studies on three real-world datasets from different e-learning platforms demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of our proposed method.}

Therefore, we performed learning analytics to explore the behavioral patterns of HS and LS students in 52 university students from affective, cognitive, and metacognitive perspectives as these students engage in online PAs. The results indicated that on the affective dimension, HS students tended to exhibit negative affection while LS students tended to display positive affection. On the cognitive dimension, HS students demonstrated more intricate transformations compared to the LS students. Regarding the metacognitive dimension, LS students more likely reflected upon and accepted the reviews provided by others than the HS. Additionally, the findings also revealed that HS students were supported by focused social networks and overall stable activity engagement, whereas the LS students were less engaged at the beginning of the activity but had evolving social networks and were more engaged in the later stages of the activity. These findings offer valuable insights for educators in effectively predicting student performance based on behavioral patterns while providing new perspectives to support instructional decision-making processes.}

The students’ academic performance is influenced by a complex interplay among several factors. Traditional educational approaches often struggle to accommodate the diverse needs of students, leading to suboptimal learning outcomes.
Purpose
This article aims to comprehensively understand the role of study strategies and learning disabilities in shaping academic performance. Through the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) tools, the purpose is to propose a decision support system (DSS) for recommendations to improve the educational approach.
Method
To identify features with higher explanatory power based on empirical data, we employed an artificial neural network (ANN) to recognize patterns of association between study strategies, learning disabilities, and academic performance. Using the pondered features, a Fuzzy-based AI was built for offering recommendations into effective educational interventions.
Conclusions
The findings underscore the significance of study strategies in mitigating the negative impact of learning disabilities on academic performance. By leveraging the proposed AI tools framework, educators can make informed decisions to tailor educational approaches, catering to the unique cognitive profiles of students. Personalized interventions based on identified patterns can lead to improved academic outcomes and greater inclusivity in the learning environment.
Practical implications
Educators and policymakers can adopt the proposed data-driven strategies to enhance teaching methodologies, thereby accommodating the varying needs of students with learning disabilities. This approach fosters a more inclusive and equitable educational landscape, promoting academic success for all learners.}

The review analyzed 46 studies between 2019 and 2023 that apply one or more Deep Learning (DL) techniques, either single or in combination with Machine Learning (ML) or Ensemble Learning techniques. Moreover, the review utilized datasets from public Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), private Learning Management Systems (LMSs), and other platforms. Four categories were used to group the features: demographic, previous academic performance, current academic performance, and learning behavior/activity features. The analysis revealed that the DNNs and CNN-LSTM models were the most common techniques. Moreover, the studies that used DL techniques, such as CNNs, DNNs, and LSTMs, performed well by achieving high prediction accuracy above 90%; other studies achieved accuracy ranging (60 to 90)%. For datasets used within the reviewed studies, even though 44% of the studies used LMSs datasets, Open University Learning Analytics Dataset (OULAD) was the most used dataset from MOOCs. The analysis of grouped features shows that among the various categories examined, learning behavior and activity features stand out as the most significant predictors, suggesting that students engagement with their learning environment through their overall participation offers crucial insights into their success. The educational prediction findings hopefully serve as a strong foundation for administrators and instructors to observe student performance and provide a suitable educational adaptation that can meet their needs to protect them from failure and prevent their dropout.}

abstract = {The huge amount of data generated by an Intelligent Tutoring System becomes useful when analyzed in an appropriate way to provide significant insights about learners, especially his or her performance. Performance data retrieved from historical interactions is the main engine for learner performance prediction, where the likelihood of the learner answering correctly future questions is calculated. Modeling learner performance can provide significant insights into individual students to promote successful learning and maximize educational achievement. This study aims to enhance the learner performance prediction of some logistic regression-based models, namely Item Response Theory, Performance Factor Analysis, and DAS3H using XGBoost, including an empirical comparison of eight real-world datasets, containing performance log data collected from different online intelligent tutoring systems, involving the first time a new dataset from Moodle Morocco. The results have demonstrated that the XGBoost has enhanced PFA predictive performance on seven datasets with an AUC of up 0.88 and improved the DAS3H AUC on the ASSISTment17 dataset while conserving almost the same predictive results for Item Response Theory on some datasets.}

abstract = {The exponential growth of data in the field of education has created a pressing demand for a robust system capable of analyzing this vast amount of information, empowering decision-makers to enhance academic efficiency. By accurately identifying student eligibility for specific courses at the outset, a multitude of challenges, such as dropouts and poor performance, can be effectively mitigated or even prevented. This paper presents a Decision Support System (DSS) that leverages a hybrid data mining model to analyze educational data and unveil concealed patterns and rules. The DSS aims to support decision-makers in enhancing the operational effectiveness of academic institutions by enabling accurate determination of student eligibility for specific courses. To ensure robust analysis, diverse supervised algorithms were implemented, comparative evaluations were conducted, and association rule and unsupervised algorithms were employed to extract hidden patterns. In a case study involving graduates pursuing Master's degrees in Iran, the hybrid model effectively identifies Bachelor's degree majors that exhibit higher likelihoods of success in the targeted course and uncovers additional factors that significantly impact academic performance. The research outcomes highlight the considerable potential of the hybrid model in facilitating informed scholarship decisions and fostering overall institutional efficiency. Furthermore, the proposed DSS could be deployed with various educational datasets, potentially empowering decision-makers with valuable insights to distinguish between successful and unsuccessful students early in the course. This could contribute to optimizing educational outcomes and informing evidence-based policy-making.}

To generate better higher learning outcomes using an intelligent tutoring system, such as an e-learning system, it is necessary to more accurately understand the state of student knowledge. The purpose of student modeling is to estimate the students’ skills from log data, such as examination results, and to predict whether or not a student will be able to solve a problem. In this study, we propose a student performance prediction method using convex factorization machines. Factorization machines offer a combination of the advantages of support vector machines and factorization models such as matrix factorization. The results of conventional methods, which predict student performance using factorization machines, exhibited better results than they have before. However, because factorization machines are not convex optimizations, they acquire local minima, which is a disadvantage. Therefore, we used convex factorization machines in order to improve the performance of student modeling predictions.}

However, this model faces challenges such as local minima and slow convergence, which have been addressed through different strategies such as combining the artificial neural network (ANN) with optimised models like the cuckoo search (CS) algorithm. However, for large datasets, the hybrid ANN-based CS algorithm can lead to overfitting. To overcome this issue, the authors propose a new algorithm called Principal Component Analysis with Cuckoo Search Neural Network (PCACSNN). The performance of this algorithm is compared to other commonly used algorithms such as ANN, backpropagation neural network (BPNN), and cuckoo search backpropagation (CSBP), using the Mean Square Error (MSE) and accuracy on classification problems. The simulations were performed on the Student Performance dataset taken from the UCIMLR. The results show that the proposed model performs better than the other models, achieving high accuracy and low MSE for both mathematics and Portuguese student datasets. For the mathematics students, the suggested model attained an accuracy of (99.32%) with MSE of 2.77E-07 for 70% training data and an accuracy of 98.52% with MSE of 2.50E-04 for 30% training data.

Machine learning algorithms are utilized to analyze the combination of data and identify patterns that predict a student's likelihood of falling behind. The proposed RADAR system employs a multi-modal approach, considering the learner's features. The system is trained on a dataset of students from a school district, where the data is collected and preprocessed accordingly. The feature selection algorithm is applied to identify the most relevant features that can accurately predict students at-risk of falling behind or dropping out. The pilot study establishes the framework of the system and examines the implementation implications. The results of this study indicate that the RADAR system achieves high accuracy in identifying at-risk students. Furthermore, the system effectively employs the identified features to predict students' performance in a continuous manner, enabling advisors, administrators, and students to take proactive measures to maintain high academic progress levels. The system is designed to provide an automated and continuous monitoring of the students' performance, and to notify the relevant parties in case of any deviations. The proposed system represents an innovative approach to using XAI for the detection and support of at-risk students, enabling educators to take timely actions.

To address these issues, we introduce the Large Language Model enhanced Signed Bipartite graph Contrastive Learning (LLM-SBCL) model—a novel Multimodal Model utilizing Signed Graph Neural Networks (SGNNs) and a Large Language Model (LLM). Our model uses a signed bipartite graph to represent students’ answers, with positive and negative edges denoting correct and incorrect responses, respectively. To mitigate noise impact, we apply contrastive learning to the signed graphs, combined with knowledge point embeddings from the LLM to further enhance our model’s predictive performance.

However, earlier studies have found problems with interpreting LMS log data to understand student approaches to learning within the context of a learning design. This study investigates whether it is possible to use LMS log data as a proxy to understand students' learning strategies over different periods of time in the flipped-classroom context. A total of 135 sophomores from two classes of a flipped programming course participated in this study. Exploratory factor analysis is first conducted on the log data to synthesize second-order predictors based on the total-effort model. Then, we investigate the extent to which these second-order predictors relate to students' learning outcomes over time. Four types of learning outcomes are considered, including a quiz, a midterm exam, a final exam and the final grade. For each type of learning outcome, multiple linear regression is used to construct a weekly prediction model from these predictors. Adjusted R-squared and RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) are the metrics used to compare the models. The results show that consistent second-order predictors can be derived from log data, implying that students' clicking events in LMS could manifest students' learning strategies understandable in the design context of a flipped classroom. Furthermore, compared with the first-order models, most of the models constructed using the second-order predictors have higher predictive performance, although with lower data fitness. In addition, the predictive performance of the models with MSLQ (Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire) indicators and past assessment data are also examined. It is found that MSQL variables have a positive but short-termed effect on the models’ predictive ability, while past assessment data greatly improve the models of all types of learning outcomes. Theoretical contributions and implications of the proposed approach for practice, research and future research are discussed.}

Considering the machine learning models are sensitive to their hyper-parameter settings, we introduce the PSO to optimize the fitness function. In addition, the threshold of a standard binary classification task is 0.5, which might not be the optimal value in real-world applications. Thus, we optimize this threshold by the PSO. To evaluate the performance of our proposed model, two datasets downloaded from the University of California, Irvine Repository and the Kaggle, respectively, are used. The experimental results showed that our proposed P2CatBoost has the best performance in terms of all the metrics used. Our proposed P2CatBoost has the best accuracy of 96.62% and 94.45% for the final grade prediction of the Mathematics and Portuguese courses, respectively. In addition, our proposed model outperforms the other models under comparison from 4.5% to 8.3%. The statistical analyses verify that our P2CatBoost can significantly outperform the comparing models. These results confirm the effectiveness of our double PSO for improving the performance of student performance prediction, indicating our proposed model could be a useful tool in educational institutions to improve the quality of education.}

This paper presents a novel methodology for predicting learning performance in online learning systems by leveraging natural language processing (NLP) and embedding techniques. The study focuses on two online learning systems, namely BookRoll and Viscode, and aims to analyze the learning behaviors of students using system logs extracted from the databases. The logs are converted into semester and daily learning description documents to capture the daily activities and progress of the learners. To transform the natural language data into numerical representations, the transformer-based BERT model, Google Gemini, and OpenAI large text embedding methodology are employed to generate embeddings for the learning descriptions. Subsequently, k-means clustering is applied to identify distinct learning behaviors exhibited by students. These clusters are labeled with numbers, and the daily learning descriptions are combined into a sequence, referred to as the DNA of learning behaviors. By utilizing this DNA representation, the learning status of students is effectively captured, and a machine learning model is trained to predict learning performance. The experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology in achieving highly convincing predictions. The contributions of this research lie in the adoption of a unique approach, integrating NLP methodologies and embeddings techniques, to enable accurate learning performance prediction in online learning systems.}

This study introduces data collection, thermal comfort indices, time scale, sample size, feature selection, model selection, and real world application as the remaining challenges in the application of ML in thermal comfort studies.}

In this study, we harnessed data from the ‘Offee’ assessment platform based in Mumbai, India, spanning from September 2020 to October 2022. This dataset allows us to analyze the real impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on examinations. To tackle the challenges posed by high-dimensional data, we employed feature selection techniques to retain only the most significant features for predicting student performance. Specifically, we assessed the effectiveness of two decision tree-based methods, J48 classifier and Random Forest, in conjunction with the ranker search method using wrapper subset evaluation. The resulting feature set was then utilized to train and test a Support Vector Machine model for predicting student performance. Our findings reveal that both J48 and Random Forest feature selection methods yield impressive precision accuracy rates for student performance prediction, achieving 93.14% and 86.24%, respectively. In contrast, using the dataset without feature selection resulted in lower precision accuracy, standing at 79.9%, and consumed more time during model training and development. In summary, this study underscores the significance of feature selection in enhancing the accuracy of student performance prediction compared to utilizing the dataset without such feature curation.}

Existing prediction methods are mainly constructed based on the classical cognitive diagnosis framework MIRT, where student performance on exercises are modeled as the interaction results of exercises’ trait vectors and students’ knowledge proficiency. The trait vector learning of exercises has a big effect on the estimation results of the knowledge proficiency. However, when learning the trait vectors, existing methods cannot exploit the rich contents of cross-modal exercises that are closely related to the traits of exercises. This makes it difficult for these methods to best cope with common cross-modal exercises. Besides, existing methods overlook the intrinsic complexity of examined concepts, which actually affects exercise traits, such as exercise difficulty. To address these issues, we propose a deep Cross-Modal Neural Cognitive Diagnosis framework (CMNCD), which mainly has two appealing advantages: (i) By extending MIRT under the framework of deep neural networks, CMNCD can effectively explore the fine-grained semantic information in the cross-modal contents of exercises for modeling student performance. (ii) CMNCD investigates the complexity of examined concepts based on the prerequisite relationships among concepts and incorporates it into the learning of exercises’ trait vectors. Extensive experiments on several real-world datasets show that our CMNCD outperforms state-of-the-art cognitive diagnosis methods.}

abstract = {Introduction
Since the advent of medical education systems, managing high-stakes exams has been a top priority and challenge for all policymakers. However, considering machine learning (ML) techniques as a replacement for medical licensing examinations, particularly during crises such as the COVID-19 outbreak, could be an effective solution. This study uses ML models to develop a framework for predicting medical students' performance on high-stakes exams, such as the Comprehensive Medical Basic Sciences Examination (CMBSE).
Material and methods
Prediction of students' status and score on high-stakes examinations faces several challenges, including an imbalanced number of failing and passing students, a large number of heterogeneous and complex features, and the need to identify at-risk and top-performing students. In this study, two major categories of ML approaches are compared: first, classic models (logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), and k-nearest neighbors (KNN)), and second, ensemble models (voting, bagging (BG), random forests (RF), adaptive boosting (ADA), extreme gradient boosting (XGB), and stacking).
Results
To evaluate the models' discrimination ability, they are assessed using a real dataset containing information on medical students over a five-year period (n = 1005). The findings indicate that ensemble ML models demonstrate optimal performance in predicting CMBSE status (RF and stacking). Similarly, among the classic regressors, LR exhibited the highest root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) (0.134) and coefficient of determination (R2) (0.62), whereas the RF model had the highest RMSD (0.077) and R2 (0.80) overall. Furthermore, Anatomical Sciences, Biochemistry, Parasitology, and Entomology grade point average (GPA) and grades demonstrated the strongest positive correlation with the outcomes.
Conclusion
Comparing classic and ensemble ML models revealed that ensemble models are superior to classic models. Therefore, the presented framework could be considered a suitable alternative for the CMBSE and other comparable medical licensing examinations.}

Three hundred and fifty video-learning records from 47,044 video viewing operations were obtained from 47 graduate students. Four learning improvement profiles were derived from a statistics course's pre- and post-test scores: the Advanced, the Diligent, the Indifferent, and the Persistent. The results indicated that the Diligent and the Persistent paused videos frequently. These students reflected the need with these self-paced breaks to take notes according to the retrospective interview. The Advanced demonstrated the highest SkippingBackward frequency with a small SkippingBackward time ratio, revealing confidence in searching the desired clips. In contrast, the Indifferent exhibited the least frequency but the largest time ratio for SkippingBackward, implying distraction problems. In addition, this study showed that the Pause time ratio was indirectly related to weekly quiz scores via autonomous motivation with marginal significance. Based on these results, we demonstrate that learning motivation can be revealed from dynamic clickstreams in video-based learning (i.e., the interaction between students and learning contexts), supporting its dynamic developmental mechanism. The authors suggest that instructors offer on-demand instructional materials and implement top-down video-viewing strategies or digital prompts to support and encourage autonomy in video-based learning.}

This research study will help the learners learn complex concepts quickly with different activities like flipped classrooms, online quizzes, learning by doing, and a virtual laboratory. This research is carried out to address the difficulties of learners and cover all the domains of learning, including knowledge, Skill, and Attitude. The fuzzy logic method has recently been applied in education to overcome these restrictions. While employing the fuzzy logic approach to evaluate student achievement, qualifications are assessed qualitatively rather than quantitatively. This research study applies Fuzzy Logic in the first stage, Factor Analysis (FA), and Machine Learning (ML) techniques in the second stage to discover essential factors associated with the effective use of Active Learning Strategies (ALS) in the Learning Management System (LMS) of information technology course learners. Fuzzy logic and neural network topology can be coupled using ANFIS, an adaptable network. FA is performed to find the critical factors for successful learners. The study compares the performance of five supervised machine learning algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Discriminant Analysis, and Support Vector Machine. These classifiers are evaluated to determine their suitability and model fit in the context of the research. In this study, real-time data is collected from B.Tech Information Technology learners. The following prediction models achieved high accuracy before FA analysis: Naive Bayes (90 %), Support Vector Machine (89 %), Discriminant Analysis (88 %), Decision Tree (86 %), and K-Nearest Neighbors (82 %). Naive Bayes gives the best accuracy, with 90 %. Following factor analysis (FA), the accuracy achieved by various classifiers is as follows: Naive Bayes - 92 %, K-Nearest Neighbors - 92 %, Support Vector Machine - 90 %, Discriminant Analysis - 89 %, and Decision Tree - 88 %. Among these, Naive Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbors exhibit the highest accuracy of 92 %.}

abstract = {Abstract - Student performance prediction has a pivotal role in educational institutions, providing valuable insights into students' academic outcomes and aiding educators in implementing personalized interventions. In the previous works, many variants of ML and AI techniques have been implemented with high accuracy. However, the lack of transparency due to the heterogeneous nature of features that lead to biases, forced inequalities or even challenges in interpreting the model implications have not been addressed. An approach that harnesses the power of hybrid intelligence, combining human expertise with artificial intelligence (AI), to enhance transparency and accountability in the decision-making process of student performance prediction is required. Co-evolutionary Hybrid Intelligence (CHI) approach, will not only discover interdisciplinary facets including past exam scores, attendance records, demographic information, and socio-economic factors but also interpret the influence of every component i.e., teacher, student, and learning environment to predict student performance. Two modules are discussed in this paper. The first module classifies the teachers into two classes of expertise by comparing the accuracy performance of six well-known machine learning techniques namely Logistic Regression (LR), MultiLayer Perceptron(MLP), Naive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), and Random Forest (RF). Second, we propose a multiclass student performance prediction model (RLCHI) built upon a combination of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms that will aid the model to perceive patterns and adjustments inherently and expert teachers' opinions(CHI) from the first model that will bring invaluably contextual understanding, nuanced judgment, and a deep knowledge of pedagogy to the equation. The performance of the RLCHI model is evaluated. The obtained results show that the proposed model scores better than models built only on the RL algorithm on the same dataset. The accuracy, precision, recall, and Fl score of the model achieved with hybrid intelligence is 79.5, 49.9, 52.3, 53.2 when compared to 71.9,48.30,46.6,46.1 achieved with only RL respectively.}

Seventy-eight people joined Facebook groups to form statistics learning communities. Using weakly supervised machine learning (ML), we categorized students' Facebook messages into statistics-relevant and statistics-irrelevant. Results of the learning analytics on multimodal sources of student data showed that help-seeking positively predicted statistics achievement. In contrast, academic procrastination with ICT negatively predicted statistics achievement, controlling for students' demographics information, including age, gender, prior knowledge, and Internet/social media use. Moreover, the ensemble ML classified messages constructed by taking the sum of relevance coding (0 or 1) across three selected ML algorithms was highly aligned with the human coded message in terms of the degree of relevance to statistics. The ensemble ML classified messages were conceptualized as students’ cognitive engagement in statistics learning due to their high consistency with the human-labeled relevance coding and were positively associated with statistics achievement with a large effect size.

abstract = {Academic institutions operate in an extremely demanding and competitive environment. Some difficulties confronting most schools are delivering high-quality education to the students, developing systems for evaluating student performance, analyzing performance, and recognizing the future demands of their learners. Also, due to the paradigm shift due to the computerization of school data management, educational stakeholders, including the machine learning (ML) community, have taken an interest in analyzing performance traits using academic and non-academic factors. This systematic literature review identifies various machine learning methods based on 84 selected publications. It shows how researchers have been able to pattern-map student characteristics and their influence on school performance. An attempt is made to answer how the overall study coverage of student characteristics and the ML methods are employed to predict students’ performance. An analysis of the 84 papers highlights that, student characteristics predominantly influencing performance are academic and demographic attributes. The study further shows that classification and decision trees are the most widely used methods and algorithms. The review also reveals population and practical knowledge gaps due to a lack of research on basic academic performance and prescription of intervention plans for averting poor performance through mapping these influential characteristics to student accomplishment. To bridge these perceived gaps, the scope of the population sample needs a benchmarked dataset and embedding the appropriate intervention outlines that will map the learner’s performance early in their school life.}

For a better understanding of the educational related phenomena, there is a continuous interest in applying supervised and unsupervised learning methods for obtaining additional insights into the students’ learning process. The problem of predicting if a student will pass or fail at a certain academic discipline based on the students’ grades received during the semester is a difficult one, highly dependent on various conditions such as the course, the number of examinations during the semester, the instructors and their exigences. We propose a new classification model, S PRAR (Students Performance prediction using Relational Association Rules) for predicting the final result of a student at a certain academic discipline using relational association rules (RARs). RARs extend the classical association rules for expressing various relationships between data attributes. Experiments are performed on three real academic data sets collected from Babeş-Bolyai University from Romania. The performance of the S PRAR classifier on the considered case studies is compared against existing related work, being superior to previously proposed students’ performance predictors.}

However, there is a lack of literature reviews that focus on AI-driven learning analytics applications and tools in CSCL contexts. To fill the gap, this systematic review provides an overview of the goals, characteristics, and effects of existing AI-driven learning analytics applications and tools in CSCL. According to the screening criteria, out of the 2607 initially identified articles between 2004 and 2023, 26 articles are included for final synthesis. Our results show that existing tools primarily focus on students’ cognitive engagement. Existing tools primarily utilize communicative discourse, behavioral, and evaluation data to present results and visualizations. Despite various formats of feedback are provided in existing tools, there is a lack of design principles to guide the tool design and development process. Moreover, although AI techniques have been applied for presenting statistical information, there is a lack of providing alert or suggestive information in existing tools or applications. Compared with the positive impacts on collaborative learning, our results indicate a lack of support for instructional interventions in existing tools. This systematic review proposes the following theoretical, technological, and practical implications: (1) the integration of educational and learning theories into AI-driven learning analytics applications and tools; (2) the adoption of advanced AI technologies to collect, analyze, and interpret multi-source and multimodal data; and (3) the support for instructors with actionable suggestions and instructional interventions.

It addresses the essential need for predictive algorithms to analyze and forecast academic results. Self-esteem and identity, as diverse psychological variables, have been highlighted as crucial determinants in creating academic success. The fundamental goal is to develop an effective prediction model for elementary school children's academic performance by including self-esteem and individuality in the analytical framework. We suggested an Owl Search Optimized Dynamic Deep Neural Network (OSO-DDNN) based model for making more precise predictions. The sample size for the research was 147,210 elementary school students who took the LegiLexi exam between 2016 and 2021. To standardize the data and improve model performance, the suggested methodology uses a pre-processing strategy based on the Min-Max scalar approach. Furthermore, Independent Component Analysis is used to detect and extract essential factors related to self-esteem, individuality and academic achievement. The architecture and parameters of the suggested approaches are optimized using the OSO algorithm to provide a prediction model that remains accurate and efficient. We quantify the effectiveness of the assessments using the following metrics: precision, recall, accuracy and F1-score to develop a design using conventional methods. The findings demonstrate that the model's resilience and promise for anticipating primary school pupils' academic success are based on psychological aspects. The OSO-DDNN is an essential instrument for educators and policymakers in identifying at-risk pupils and implementing targeted interventions, supporting a comprehensive approach to education that combines psychological well-being with academic performance.}

Centrifuge shaking table tests and moving-steps strategy is used to create database for model training. Results shows that DBO-Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory (BiLSTM) demonstrate superiority than DBO-RNN, DBO-LSTM and DBO-Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) due to its unique bidirectional learning ability. Moreover, 20 cases involving artificial waves with an average PGA of 0.1 g were predicted using the DBO-BiLSTM model and subsequently compared with measured data for validation. The results indicate that the proposed DBO-BiLSTM model is effective for time-series prediction of seismic responses in slope reinforcement structures. This model provides valuable solutions for the performance design and health monitoring of slope engineering structures, particularly in situations where monitoring data are limited.}

Specifically, we first embed exercise and student features into high-dimensional vectors. Then, we use a measurement module with a bilayer architecture to establish the interaction between students and exercises, considering guessing and slipping factors. To capture long short-term dependencies on historical data, we design the long short-term learning transfer module based on the attention mechanism, which computes state transfer weights by incorporating occasion time and mastery state. Finally, extensive experimental results on four public datasets demonstrate the superiority and good interpretability of our proposed model.}

The social networks metrics for each student and the degree of propagation of grade point average are computed and integrated with students’ records for pattern mining serving as a proxy for the existing bond among students, which is a relevant factor for attrition and dropout analysis. This paper examines the Bachelor Program in Production Engineering at the Federal Center for Technological Education of Rio de Janeiro from 2011 to 2017. Our experiments indicate congruence with the literature: (i) lower school performance leading to delay; (ii) higher performance leading to graduation in optimal time. Besides, our new method sheds light on students with little participation in the social network who are more likely to delay or drop out. Our findings may aid managers in discovering students with patterns that can indicate imminent lateness or dropout.}

abstract = {Educators' loss of ability to read students' comprehension level during the class through quick questions or nonverbal communication is one of the main challenges of online and blended learning. Many researchers recently tackled this problem by proposing different frameworks for predicting students' academic performance. However, previous work relies heavily on feature engineering. Feature engineering is the process of selecting, transforming, manipulating, and constructing new variables from raw data using domain knowledge. A disadvantage of feature engineering is that the features are tailored to a specific dataset making the constructed models inflexible when used in new datasets. A direct consequence is that features need to be rebuilt for each course. This paper proposes a more flexible framework to predict the students' academic performance. In this framework, the raw data is used directly to construct the prediction model without the feature engineering step. The feature selection is instead based on model interpretability. The framework is applied to the open university learning analytics dataset (OULAD) with two different type of classifiers: random forest and artificial neural networks. Obtained results show that the feature engineering step can be abandoned without affecting the models' prediction performance. The prediction results of the flexible feature selection framework either outperform or have a difference of less than 1% accuracy compared to other work in the literature that relies on a manual feature engineering step. Both random forest and artificial neural networks without feature engineering accomplish a high prediction accuracy for the case of students at risk of failing with 86% and 88% compared to all students with pass grades and students with distinction grades, respectively. Also, the prediction models have the highest accuracy rate of 93% in predicting drop-out students. Yet, the prediction models in the proposed framework and previous research work perform poorly in predicting high achieving students with maximum accuracy of 81%, a precision of 69%, and a recall of 57%.}

abstract = {A cognitive state (CS) assessment can be effectively performed using Electroencephalogram (EEG). However, due to the curse of dimensionality issues of EEG, most of the clustering methods often lead to poor performance. Deep neural network-based representation learning transforms high-dimensional data into lower-dimensional feature space, increasing the performance of CS prediction in students. So, in this research, a novel graph-based conventional attention neural network (GA-CNN) is developed to reduce distribution differences while analyzing student performance. To perform this classification, the obtained EEG signal dataset is denoised with the help of Stationary Wavelet Transform (SWT) based Independent Component Analysis (ICA) that filters out the noise signals. Likewise, the behavioural dataset is pre-processed using zero normalization and Not a Number (NaN) value computation method. Then, the effective features are extracted from the pre-processed data using the Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) technique. Finally, the GA-CNN model is initiated to classify the students’ cognitive state (CS). The proposed method is implemented using the MATLAB tool, and the performance of the expected GA-CNN model is compared to other approaches where the analysis is done using the benchmark Kaggle EEG data set. The classification accuracy is significantly improved compared to other methods. The model achieves 87% accuracy, 98% precision, 75% recall, and 85% F1 score, outperforming various methods and making a better compromise.}

To address this challenge, we introduce a specialized system tailored to identifying and comprehending the complex range of student behaviors exhibited during online classes. Our system takes into account the diverse contexts and individual considerations that shape students' responses to the online learning environment.

Leveraging these components, we extract high-level features to construct a comprehensive dataset for training machine-learning models designed to detect students' attention levels during online classes. After evaluating six prominent machine learning algorithms, we have selected the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithm, which demonstrated an impressive 99.75% accuracy on the test data. Finally, the system generates a comprehensive anonymous report on the level of attentiveness of students, accessible through a dedicated webpage that includes a summary of the behavior of students throughout online classes, providing valuable insights for personalized interventions and enhanced online learning experiences.}

We are proposing a new one-class classifier, named RadRAR (Radar products’ values prediction using Relational Association Rules) for convective storms nowcasting based on radar data. More specifically, RadRAR is trained on radar data collected from normal weather conditions and learns to predict whether the radar echo values will be higher than 35dBZ, i.e. likely to indicate the occurrence of a storm. RadRAR is intended to be a proof a concept that relational association rule mining applied on radar data is helpful in discriminating between severe and normal weather conditions.

abstract = {Background and aim:
In recent days, the research on student’s intelligence level modelling is a challenging Artificial Intelligence (AI) task, which gains more attraction because it provides actionable insights to the tutor by analysing the intelligence level of the learners. Each learner’s knowledge, comprehension, and intellectual capacities are unique. It is critical to identify these capacities and provide learners, particularly slow learners, with the necessary knowledge. Cognitive Performance Test (CPT) is an essential component for assessing the knowledge level of students. The reasoning level or coefficient deals with the analysis of the thinking capability in a logical way. It also reflects the child’s learning potential. The main aim of the proposed system is to design a Cognitive Knowledge Representation Model (CKRM), which fuses Cognitive Performance Metrics (CPM) calculation and Reasoning Coefficient Calculation (RCC) algorithms to assess the student’s intelligence level. The result of the proposed system is stratification of students to three different ranges of reasoning coefficient.
Methods:
The CKRM consists of the following phases: data collection, statistical Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), model building and analysis, which involve the assessment of the knowledge level using CPT and calculation of reasoning coefficient using First Order Logic (FOL), and finally model evaluation using cognitive evaluation metrics. CPM and RCC algorithms have been proposed in this paper to calculate the student’s reasoning coefficient by using the forward chaining FOL inference engine. The dataset is a real time data which consists of the academic and cognitive performance details of school students from classes 1 to 6 for the year 2019 to 2020. The academic data are collected from the Educational Management Information System (EMIS) maintained by the school. The cognitive performance data are collected by conducting the tests for the students using the memory training application called Lumosity.
Results:
The proposed system’s performance is evaluated using ten Machine Learning (ML) algorithms in which the Quadratic Discriminant Analysis achieved an accuracy of 0.97 for classes 1, 2, and 3. For classes 4, 5, and 6, nearly twelve ML algorithms are evaluated in which Random Forest (RF) Classifier achieved an accuracy of 0.98. Six math expert committee teachers concluded that the reasoning coefficient value was acceptable with an average accuracy of 0.92 for classes 1, 2, 3 and 0.9 for classes 4, 5, 6. In comparison to the pre-existing models employed in the prior research, it was determined that the created CKRM (academic and cognitive) was superior. The cognitive metrics such as taskability, Response Time (RT), knowledge capacity and utilization has also been evaluated. The average values of taskability, RT, knowledge capacity and knowledge utilization are 0.85, 0.81, 0.55, and 0.44.
Conclusion:
The ultimate goal is to make customized teaching easier; hence, this article involves determining a student’s cognitive level by estimating their reasoning coefficient. The suggested approach analyses and categorizes students’ cognitive abilities, such as memory, reasoning, problem solving, thinking, and logical reasoning, using three different reasoning coefficients. This approach assists teachers in determining the degree of intelligence of their students.}

abstract = {Cognitive diagnosis is an intelligent education task that aims to learn students’ cognitive states on knowledge concepts based on historical answering logs over questions. Existing studies focus on modeling the interactions between students and questions through either manual-designed functions (e.g., logistic function) or complex neural network structures. However, such studies neglect the question difficulty bias, i.e., questions exhibit uneven distribution on the answering frequency, as simple questions are answered more times than difficult ones for the given concept. To tackle this issue, we present a Causal Cognitive Diagnosis Framework (CausalCDF), which considers the question difficulty bias and could be readily integrated with traditional diagnostic models for better cognitive diagnosis. Specifically, we first analyze the effect of question difficulty (acting as the confounder) on student performance via a causal graph. Then we eliminate the bad effect of the confounding difficulty bias via causal intervention in model training.

abstract = {The application of energy-efficient strategies in buildings, such as the Green Building Concept, can significantly impact human comfort and resource consumption. However, due to the complexity of decision-making factors and the variety of available materials, computational models are necessary to identify the most effective solutions and optimise building energy performance. This study presents an integrated framework that uses machine learning algorithms and a Petri Net control system to optimise the thermal, comfort, and energy efficiency of both vertical and horizontal building envelopes in semi-arid climate zones. The framework incorporates several passive techniques for building energy parameters, including material thickness and melting point, window types, wall insulation thickness and thermal emissivity, wall solar absorbance, window wall ratio, fenestration position, air tightness, roof solar reflectance, roof insulation thickness and conductivity (W/(m·°C)), and floor insulation thickness. An experiment design was developed using Box-Behnken Design-Response Surface Methodology (BBD-RSM) for statistical optimisation, which was coupled with Design Builder simulation model. The methodology was demonstrated by applying it to a residential building in Mexico. Meta Additive Regression was used to analyse the output factors, which showed higher confidence compared to REP Tree and M5P Tree algorithms in green buildings. The results demonstrate that an annual energy reduction of 50 kW/m2 per household can be achieved by using an optimised building envelope.}

abstract = {With the development of big data technology, the field of monitoring and improving teaching quality in universities has ushered in new opportunities and challenges. Big data technology enables the capture and analysis of massive amounts of data generated during the teaching process, providing the possibility for a deeper understanding of teaching activities. However, how to extract useful information from these vast amounts of data and transform it into strategies for teaching improvement is a challenge. The research aims to propose a teaching quality monitoring and improvement method based on big data technology, which combines K-means clustering algorithm and association rule mining algorithm to improve the accuracy of teaching monitoring and the effectiveness of teaching improvement. In order to cope with these challenges, the study proposes a research method of big data technology based on joint K-mean clustering algorithm and association rule mining algorithm. The study first analyzes the teaching quality monitoring and evaluation indexes using the K-mean algorithm. Then the association rule mining algorithm is utilized to mine the data in the teaching quality monitoring indicators with association rules on the basis of the obtained cluster analysis. Finally, on the basis of association rule mining, the study constructs the assessment model of teaching quality monitoring indicators by utilizing the fused method. The outcomes revealed that the average of data analysis accuracy and the average of recall rate of the modeling method were 93.79 % and 91.95 %, respectively. Meanwhile, the evaluation time of the modeling method in the process of teaching quality monitoring data processing was 17.3 s, and the evaluation precision was 93.15 % respectively. Additionally, the process's overall confidence and enhancement are 95.01 % and 86.73 %, respectively, and the modeling method's performance is compared to other approaches. This shown that the approach may significantly boost the precision and effectiveness of monitoring the quality of instruction, as well as offer strong backing for the enhancement of instruction in higher education institutions.}

Most of the existing efforts directly predict students’ performance depending on their dynamically changing knowledge states. However, the individualization of questions is neglected and difficulty level differ from question to question, which would give some valuable clues to KT. Towards this end, in this paper, we propose a novel Multiple Question Factors for Knowledge Tracing (MQFKT) method, which fully exploits various question factors to generate better prediction. On one hand, calibrated student-concept connection space is established to obtain fine-grained response representations on questions according to the information of responses on questions. On the other hand, individualized difficulty levels with particular concept for different questions are introduced for improving the prediction performance. Extensive experiments on three datasets have shown that the MQFKT approach achieves more precise prediction of student performance and better interpretation of the model.}

Relational association rules (RARs), a data analysis and mining concept, have been introduced as an extension of classical association rules (ARs) for capturing various relationships between the attributes characterizing the data. Due to its NP-completeness, the problem of mining all the interesting RARs within a data set is computationally difficult. As the dimensionality of the data set to be mined increases, the classical algorithm Discovery of Relational Association Rules (DRAR) for RARs mining fails in providing the set of rules in reasonable time. This paper introduces a new approach named CRAR (Concurrent Relational Association Rule mining) which uses concurrency for the RARs discovery process and thus significantly reduces the mining time. The effectiveness of CRAR is empirically validated on nine open source data sets. The reduction in mining time when using CRAR against DRAR emphasizes that it can be successfully applied in various practical data mining scenarios.}

The study involved multimodal data involving video and electrodermal activities (EDA) data collected from ninety-four secondary school students (N = 94) during five science lessons to reveal trigger events in CL. A novel concept of trigger events is introduced, which are challenging events and/or situations that may inhibit collaboration and will, therefore, require strategic adaptation in the regulation of cognition, motivation, and emotion within the group. The ANOVA results for the Skin Conductance Responses (SCRs) analysis indicated the disparity of physiological behavior activated in relation to different types of interactions for regulation. Process analysis and episode-rule mining were applied to reveal regulatory patterns in CL, while an AI approach with long short-term memory (LSTM) deep-learning networks were designed for pattern prediction. LSTM has emerged as the most widely applied artificial recurrent neural network (RNN) architecture for sequential data analysis and classification. The proposed AI network holds the potential for designing solutions for similar signal-processing problems in studying learning regulation.

One key challenge is that a player may deploy several interweaved and overlapped skills during gameplay, making the assessment task nontrivial. In this research, we present a generalizable DKT approach called GameDKT that integrates state-of-the-art machine learning with domain knowledge to model the learners’ knowledge state during gameplay, in an attempt to monitor and trace their proficiency level for the different skills required for educational games. Our findings reveal that GameDKT approach could successfully predict the performance of players in the coming game task using the cross-validated CNN model with accuracy and AUC of roughly 85% and 0.913, respectively, thus outperforming the MLP baseline model by up to 14%. When the performance of players is forecasted for up to four game tasks in advance, results show that the CNN model can achieve more than 70% accuracy. Interestingly, this model seems to be better and faster at identifying local patterns and it could achieve a higher performance compared to RNN and LSTM in both one-step and multi-step prediction of learners’ performance in game tasks.}

Knowledge Tracing (KT) plays a role similar to that of educators in online teaching. By analyzing past performances, KT identifies learners’ knowledge states and predicts the outcomes of future exercises. However, the existing KT models assume that the learner’s performance is a binary variable (i.e., correct or incorrect) without refining learner performance or differentiating knowledge states. Multiple-choice tests employ distractors that engage learners in different knowledge states, with each distraction implying a specific error. In multiple-choice exercises, we propose an option-weighting-enhanced mixture-of-expert knowledge tracing (WEKT) method that assigns weights to different options based on improved option weighting scoring. The option weights affirm partial knowledge and refine the knowledge state. Building on the multi-task learning strategy, we design a mixture-of-experts framework that simultaneously predicts correctness and options, traces students’ specific errors, and refines students’ performances. The expert structure combines cognitive theory with deep learning technology, taking into consideration the differences between experts and students. Extensive experiments on large-scale datasets indicate that WEKT can refine knowledge states and attain more precise predictions of student performance.}

We develop Indonesian Bigram Word Rule for Multi-label Student Complaints (Ina-BWR) to identify multi-label student problems based on Bigram Word Rule. Ina-BWR consists of three processes such as preprocessing informal text, identifying complaint and object from text. Additional preprocessing techniques are conducted to formalize the text such as parsing a hashtag, correcting affixes word, correcting a conjunction word, parsing suffix people pronoun and correcting typo words. Indonesian bigram word rule is adopted from opinion identification rules with 3 additional corpuses (-)NN, (-)JJ and (-)VB to identify student complaints. To identify complaints, four label corpuses have been created manually. The experimental results show that Ina-BWR can increase Personal, Subject and Relation label accuracies. The best accuracy for four labels is obtained when Ina-BWR is combined with BoW method.}

abstract = {The primary objective of knowledge tracing (KT) is to trace learners’ changing knowledge states and predict their future performance by analyzing their learning trajectories. One of the fundamental assumptions underpinning KT is that estimating knowledge states is roughly equivalent to predicting future performance. However, this assumption has not been extensively explored in most studies, particularly in relation to the consistency between observable performance and latent knowledge state. To address this challenge, we propose a novel response speed enhanced fine-grained knowledge tracing (FKT) method. FKT leverages response speed through response time and integrates speed prediction as an additional task within a multi-task learning framework. Through this framework, FKT can separate representations of different knowledge state in the feature space, thereby facilitating fine-grained knowledge tracing. Moreover, we divide the task of predicting learner performance into three procedures: obtaining historical knowledge state, inferring future latent traits, and forecasting future performance. To this end, we formalize each learner’s response interaction as a time cell and develop an encoder–decoder–predictor framework for KT. To enhance the accuracy of performance prediction, we introduce a time-distance attention mechanism and knowledge proficiency component and provide two multi-task objective functions. Our experimental results on four real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of future performance prediction and good interpretability of FKT.}

The study introduces a teaching quality evaluation (TQE) model based on one-dimensional CNN, addressing issues such as subjectivity and inconsistent evaluation criteria in traditional assessment methods. By constructing a comprehensive TQE system comprising 24 evaluation indicators, this study innovatively applies deep learning technology to quantitatively assess the quality of physical dance education. This TQE model processes one-dimensional evaluation data by extracting local features through convolutional layers, reducing dimensions via pooling layers, and feeding feature vectors into a classifier through fully connected layers to achieve an overall assessment of teaching quality. Experimental results demonstrate that after 150 iterations of training and validation on the TQE model, convergence is achieved, with mean squared error (MSE) decreasing to 0.0015 and 0.0216 on the training and validation sets, respectively. Comparatively, the TQE model exhibits significantly lower MSE on the training, validation, and test sets compared to the Back-Propagation Neural Network, accompanied by a higher R2 value, indicating superior accuracy and performance in data fitting. Further analysis on robustness, parameter sensitivity, multi-scenario adaptability, and long-term learning capabilities reveals the TQE model's strong resilience and stability in managing noisy data, varying parameter configurations, diverse teaching contexts, and extended time-series data. In practical applications, the TQE model is implemented in physical dance courses at X College to evaluate teaching quality and guide improvement strategies for instructors, resulting in notable enhancements in teaching quality and student satisfaction. In conclusion, this study offers a comprehensive evaluation of university physical dance education quality through a multidimensional assessment system and the application of the 1D-CNN model. It introduces a novel and effective approach to assessing teaching quality, providing a scientific foundation and practical guidance for future educational advancements.}

abstract = {Modern intelligent systems nowadays make significant use of human–computer interaction (HCI). Questions of human perception, human intelligence, human cognitive capabilities, human decision-making capabilities, and interactive techniques of visualization are dealt with by HCI. Whereas, the questions of machine intelligence and data mining is dealt with by knowledge discovery in databases (KDD). HCI mainly emphasizes supervised methods. Automatic computational methods can be worked upon by combining the capabilities of both HCI and KDD. The development of algorithms that are scalable for discovering earlier unknown associations in the data thus are based on automatic computational methods by combining the capabilities of both. The first HCI happens in the primitive years of a child. The digital era we are living in and all the more pandemics have made our education system adapt to the newest technology with open hands. Challenging times in the field of education have been conquered by the fast adaptation of the latest technology and trends. It is not going to stop here and will become an integral part of our education system. The latest technologies like artificial intelligence and data mining are known for their predictive capabilities and can play a significant role in the field of education, specifically in the higher education system. Every year a substantial number of graduates strive in the job market for decent employment opportunities. On the contrary, the economy of the world is not generating adequate employment opportunities. The pandemic has made the situation even worse with lots of job cutdowns. To increase the possibility of obtaining a decent job, institutes need to improve their academic qualification. They should also equip students with essential employability skills. Accurate prediction of graduates' employability at early stages such as in the very first year of their course enrollment can be of great help. This chapter projects a proposal for building a system that applies the KDD–HCI integrated approach by showcasing a case study for prediction of employability in higher education by using data generated and stored after HCI in various tests. The framework proposed in this chapter provides a generalized solution to students' employability prediction by integrating supervised and unsupervised techniques of artificial intelligence. These skills can be tested first with HCI by conducting various tests of students at the entry level. The scores obtained then go through the process of employability prediction with the help of the proposed framework, which can help in deciding the skills to be improved in an individual student before they compete, thus improving the chance of selection. Therefore, the proposed framework provides a customized solution to every student.}

This study adopts an automated configurational approach that integrates bidirectional encoder representation from transformers (BERT) and fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to explore the configurations of learning engagement, their connections with learning achievement, and variations across disciplines. Our analysis reveals a nuanced profile of learners' learning engagement, indicating the high-achieving individuals demonstrated more frequent posting and commenting behaviors and the high-level cognitive engagement than low-achieving individuals. Second, our analysis revealed multiple configurations where the coexistence or absence of factors at different levels of the cognitive, behavioral, and emotional dimensions significantly impacted learning achievement. Learners who conducted posting and replying behaviors, expressed positive emotions, and engaged in deep cognitive engagement tended to achieve superior learning outcomes. Third, there were significant differences in behavioral and emotional engagement among learners across different academic disciplines. Specifically, pure discipline learners were more inclined to engage in posting behaviors than the applied discipline learners. Across academic disciplines, positive emotions correlated strongly with higher achievement. These findings deepen our understanding of the multifaceted characteristics of learning engagement in MOOCs and highlight the importance of disciplinary distinctions, providing a foundation for educators and designers to optimize learners’ MOOC effects and tailor learning experiences in diverse disciplinary contexts.}

abstract = {Knowledge tracing (KT) aims to monitor students’ evolving knowledge states through their learning interactions with concept-related questions, and can be indirectly evaluated by predicting how students will perform on future questions. In this paper, we observe that there is a common phenomenon of answer bias, i.e., a highly unbalanced distribution of correct and incorrect answers for each question. Existing models tend to memorize the answer bias as a shortcut for achieving high prediction performance in KT, thereby failing to fully understand students’ knowledge states. To address this issue, we approach the KT task from a causality perspective. A causal graph of KT is first established, from which we identify that the impact of answer bias lies in the direct causal effect of questions on students’ responses. A novel COunterfactual REasoning (CORE) framework for KT is further proposed, which separately captures the total causal effect and direct causal effect during training, and mitigates answer bias by subtracting the latter from the former in testing. The CORE framework is applicable to various existing KT models, and we implement it based on the prevailing DKT, DKVMN, and AKT models, respectively. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of CORE in making the debiased inference for KT. We have released our code at https://github.com/lucky7-code/CORE.}

Academic help-seeking is a quite prevalent phenomenon that supports students to learn knowledge and improve academic performance. This study is aiming to understand learners and associate their performances via exploiting academic help-seeking moods with online learning of institutional education setting. Adopting the relevant theories, we propose a novel research model and identify three different online help-seeking moods, which are namely goal-directed seeker, exploratory seeker and avoidant seeker. Goal-directed seekers are described with preference for more challenging assignments and more posting on the platform discussion board frequently. Exploratory seekers hold the highest achievements during all help-seeking moods. Avoidant seekers are well-distinguished by holding the lowest frequency of posting among all moods and the most average time spent on the platform. Students have collective preferences for assignment submission in each help-seeking mood, and deviation from those preferences increases their probability of dropping academic grade significantly. To the best of our knowledge, this research is the first work that characterizes the help-seeking moods and associates moods with the enrollment performance for online education of institutional student.}

However, despite the numerous variables that could potentially impact a student's future profession, the STEAM educational system accurately predicts the academic achievement of students in five to seven broad majors. A smart model, data, generative, factors (DGF), has been proposed to assign a specific major for each student based on their academic background, interests, skills, and main influencing factors. The DGF model uses the supervised deep neural network and is trained by the generative adversarial network (GAN) algorithm. The DGF model has the capability to predict a specific major among 17 different majors for every student, with a high learning performance (1.4133), a plausible error rate (0.0046), a rational number of learning epochs (206), and an optimal accuracy of 99.99%.}

The proliferation of sensor technology has driven the field of learning technology towards the development of tools and methods that may benefit from the produced Multi-Modal Data (MMD). Such data can be used to uncover cognitive, affective and physiological processes during learning activities. Combining MMD with more traditionally exercised assessment tools, such as video content analysis, provides a more holistic understanding of children’s learning experiences and has the potential to enable the design of educational technologies capable of harmonising children’s cognitive, affective and physiological processes, while promoting appropriately balanced play and problem-solving efforts. However, the use of an MMD mixed methods approach that combines qualitative and MMD data to understand children’s behaviours during engagement with MBLT is rather unexplored. We present an in-situ study where 26 children, ages 10–12, solved a motion-based sorting task for learning geometry. We continuously and unobtrusively monitored children’s learning experiences using MMD collection via eye-trackers, wristbands, Kinect joint tracking, and a web camera. We devised SP3, a novel observational scheme that can be used to understand children’s solo interactions with MBLT, and applied it to identify and extract children’s evoked play and problem-solving behaviour. Collective analysis of the MMD and video codes provided explanations of children’s task performance through consideration of their holistic learning experience. Lastly, we applied predictive modelling to identify the synergies between various MMD measurements and children’s play and problem-solving behaviours. This research sheds light on the opportunities offered in the confluence of video coding (a traditional method in learning sciences) and MMD (an emerging method that leverages sensors proliferation) for investigating children’s behaviour with MBLT.}

abstract = {The rapid proliferation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications in various domains of our lives has prompted a need for a shift towards a human-centered and trustworthy approach to AI. In this study we employ the Assessment List for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (ALTAI) checklist to evaluate the trustworthiness of Artificial Intelligence for Student Performance Prediction (AI4SPP), an AI-powered system designed to detect students at risk of school failure. We strongly support the ethical and legal development of AI and propose an implementation design where the user can choose to have access to each level of a three-tier outcome bundle: the AI prediction alone, the prediction along with its confidence level, and, lastly, local explanations for each grade prediction together with the previous two information. AI4SPP aims to raise awareness among educators and students regarding the factors contributing to low school performance, thereby facilitating the implementation of interventions not only to help students, but also to address biases within the school community. However, we also emphasize the ethical and legal concerns that could arise from a misuse of the AI4SPP tool. First of all, the collection and analysis of data, which is essential for the development of AI models, may lead to breaches of privacy, thus causing particularly adverse consequences in the case of vulnerable individuals. Furthermore, the system’s predictions may be influenced by unacceptable discrimination based on gender, ethnicity, or socio-economic background, leading to unfair actions. The ALTAI checklist serves as a valuable self-assessment tool during the design phase of AI systems, by means of which commonly overlooked weaknesses can be highlighted and addressed. In addition, the same checklist plays a crucial role throughout the AI system life cycle. Continuous monitoring of sensitive features within the dataset, alongside survey assessments to gauge users’ responses to the systems, is essential for gathering insights and intervening accordingly. We argue that adopting a critical approach to AI development is essential for societal progress, believing that it can evolve and accelerate over time without impeding openness to new technologies. By aligning with ethical principles and legal requirements, AI systems can make significant contributions to education while mitigating potential risks and ensuring a fair and inclusive learning environment.}

This research proposes using Moodle's learning logs to classify learning patterns and outliers in order to identify struggling learners. The proposed method uses the descriptive statistics between the learner's teaching material clickstream and the final test score accumulated in Moodle, and students can be classified into four learning patterns. The frequency of each learning pattern was correlated with the appearance of outliers in the final test score and the teaching material clickstream. Most learners moved through four learning patterns during the weekly lessons, however, some learners scoring at the top and bottom of the weekly quiz scores repeated the same learning patterns. There was a tendency to correspond to an outlier due to the repetition of the same learning pattern. The time-series learning analytics of the teaching material clickstream revealed that learners with low final test scores and abnormal values tended to fall under a learning pattern with a smaller teaching material clickstream and a smaller access outside class hours.}

abstract = {Over the past two decades, studying the various factors affecting student performance became essential. Knowing these factors assist in enhancing student’s performance, teaching practices and policy decisions. This research proposes a framework named “Semantic-based Modeling Framework for Student Outcome Prediction” (SMFSOP), to automatically map students’ activities within their learning environment to a standardized behavioral model (Community of Inquiry model (CoI)). The generated student representation is utilized to cluster students and predict an outcome based on their cluster. The framework is divided into three phases: Data gathering and pre-processing, automated mapping, clustering and prediction. The automatic mapping uses semantic similarity between student attribute names/descriptions, and CoI model indicators. Path and BERT similarities were identified as the best performers compared to human annotators. K-means, DBSCAN, and Kernel K-means are used for the clustering step, followed by LassoCV for regression-based prediction, & K-nearest neighbors for classification-based prediction. In order to prove that the proposed framework is generally applicable, three real life datasets were used as a case study. Best-performing trials enhanced outcome prediction as follows: In StudentLife Dataset, Adjusted R2 is enhanced by 3% (95% to 98%), and MSE decreased by 2.375 % (0.126 to 0.031). In social network dataset, Adjusted R2 was enhanced by 17% (65% to 82%). The MSE decreased by 4.4% (0.164 to 0.12). For the “Open university learning Analytics dataset” (OULAD), accuracy is improved by 1.56%, F1-score enhanced by 0.014. Precision is enhanced by 3.1%.}

However, key questions remain: to what extent do these clickstream measures correspond to traditional self-reported measures about specific SRL constructs? Do these clickstream measures provide more information than existing self-reported measures in predicting course performance? This study used the clickstream data collected from a learning management system to measure two aspects of SRL: time management and effort regulation. We found that the clickstream measures were significantly associated with students' self-reported time management and effort regulation after the course. In addition, these clickstream measures significantly improved predictions of students' performance in the current and subsequent courses over predictions based on self-reported measures alone. These results provide evidence for the validity of the clickstream measures and guide the use of clickstream data to understand the process of SRL and identify students who might not be well served by taking classes online.}

In this work, the influence of different institution attributes on graduate employability is investigated using the hyperbox machine learning technique, which is capable of generating classification models in the form of if/then rules. The analysis focuses on Southeast Asian universities listed in the 2020 Quacquarelli Symonds Asian University Rankings and uses the normalized scores across the different ranking criteria.

Due to the different knowledge level of students and the large scale of exercise banks, it is difficult for general recommenders to recommend suitable exercises for each student, which decreases their learning efficiency. In this paper, we develop a 2-layer multi-objective framework for exercise recommendation with self-attention networks, abbreviated as MulOER-SAN, to capture the change in students’ knowledge acquisition and thus provide customized exercise recommendations. Note that MulOER-SAN is a 2-layer framework. Via the bottom layer, a self-attention mechanism is adopted to predict the coverage in the next exercise, which can lead the learning process in the right direction. Moreover, we implement a novel knowledge tracing model with an enhanced self-attention sub-layer, thus tracing students’ dynamic knowledge state evolution. As the top layer of the 2-layer model, exercises are filtered according to the bottom layer’s predicted results, and the candidate subsets with appropriate difficulty and novelty are generated. From the perspective of diversity, we also carefully develop a chaotic sparrow search algorithm to further filter the candidate subset to avoid redundancy of recommended results. On the above basis, a simple yet effective difficulty smoothness factor is implemented to generate a high-quality ranking list in a real teaching application scenario. Comprehensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets have demonstrated that the proposed MulOER-SAN framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of various evaluation metrics.}

More importantly, the ImageLM approach identifies the regions that contribute the most to the predictions, shedding light on learners' computational thinking knowledge and advancing toward trustworthy AI for education. These results underline the potential of utilizing imagery data from learners’ activities during the learning process to predict their performance, especially in challenging environments like programming where traditional feature extraction and learning might struggle.}

abstract = {In this paper, we propose a framework called Gating-controlled Forgetting and Learning mechanisms for Deep Knowledge Tracing (GFLDKT for short). In GFLDKT, two gating-controlled mechanisms are designed to model explicitly forgetting and learning behaviors in students’ learning process. With the designed gating-controlled mechanisms, both the interaction records and students’ different backgrounds are combined effectively for tracing the dynamic changes of students’ mastery of knowledge concepts. Results from extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art models on the KT task. In addition, the ablation study shows that designed forgetting and learning mechanisms contribute clearly to the performance improvement of GFLDKT.}

This study introduced deep learning theory and designed a SPOC teaching mode for music and dance in universities to improve the quality of music and dance teaching. Firstly, the K-means clustering algorithm was used to extract the features of online learning behavior. Radial basis function neural network was used to predict students’ performance to improve teachers’ mastery of students’ online learning behavior. Subsequently, the teaching quality evaluation system was constructed using hierarchical analysis. Finally, the effectiveness of the teaching model was tested. The results showed that under this teaching model, students’ overall literacy score reached a maximum of 11.5, and their average score in music and dance reached a maximum of 94, an increase of 11 points compared to the SPOC teaching mode. This indicates that the teaching mode gives full play to the advantages of SPOC teaching, enhances students’ enthusiasm and initiative in learning, and improves their professionalism and comprehensive quality.}

To address these problems, we propose a novel approach to generating exam papers based on prediction of exam performance. As such, we update the quality of the initially generated questions one by using dynamic programming, as well as in batches by using genetic algorithms. We performed the prediction task by using Deep Knowledge Tracing. Our approach considered the skill weight, difficulty, and distribution of exam scores. By comparisons, experimental results indicate that our approach performed better than the two baselines. Furthermore, it can generate exam papers with adaptive difficulties closely to the expected levels, and the related student exam scores will be guaranteed to be relatively reasonable distribution.

FMR is a model-based clustering approach that models the data by assigning individual observations to one of the K latent regression clusters. In some applications, it is desired to cluster groups of observations together rather than individually. We present an extension to the regular FMR, that we call the Grouped Mixture of Regressions (GMR), which allows for a known group structure among observations, in addition to their possibly unknown heterogeneity. The research is motivated by a large financial longitudinal dataset from a brand of automotive dealerships across the United States. The task was to cluster the dealers based on their financial performance and also improve performance prediction for individual dealers. We derive a fast and salable algorithm for estimating the model parameters using Expectation–Maximization (EM). We also show how the group structure can improve prediction by sharing information among members of each group, as reflected in the posterior predictive density under GMR. The performance of the approach is assessed using both synthetic data as well as the dealership data. Among our findings are the superior predictive performance of GMR and the ability to correctly detect the number of clusters using simple cross-validation.}

abstract = {Across intelligent education, knowledge tracing (KT) is a fundamental problem in realizing personalized education. Recently, several approaches using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) view knowledge tracing problems as predicting a student’s future performance based on the student’s past learning activities. However, deep learning-based models merely predict the students’ future performance, failing to explain the reason why the students answered correctly or incorrectly. These approaches are seldom investigated from a theoretical perspective, preventing a deep understanding of student learning. In this paper, we first define incremental knowledge tracing problem and then propose a dynamic tracing method to track students’ knowledge changes, a new online learning-based model, named Online Meta-knowledge Dictionary Learning (OMDL). OMDL assumes that student knowledge increment is processed with stationary independent increments and derives the objective function of knowledge tracing from the perspective of probability. More precisely, this method has three innovations: propose an online learning algorithm suitable for hidden Markov data; update the meta-knowledge dictionary and students’ knowledge representation online without collecting all data; and trace student knowledge increment explicitly. The empirical study was conducted on four education public datasets, with student prediction accuracy used as the metric for assessing algorithm effectiveness. Experimental results indicate that the OMDL algorithm outperforms existing knowledge tracing methods, achieving a 20% increase in prediction accuracy across all datasets.}

With intelligent technology support, identification and intervention of learners’ cognition have made great achievement, but the care of emotion has been in the absence for a long time. In recent years, the use of affective computing technology to solve affective loss in online education has become a key research topic. To date, a growing number of studies have investigated automated emotion recognition (AER) in online environments. However, AER has been mainly studied from the perspective of computer science focusing on technical characteristics of developing AI technology while its pedagogical value and educational application has been overlooked. Therefore, this systematic literature review aimed to bring together educational and technical aspects of AER. Following PRISMA methodology, a comprehensive search of AER research from 2010 to 2024 in three databases (Web of Science, Science Direct and IEEE Xplore) identified 117 studies that met inclusion criteria. The articles were coded for report characteristics, educational characteristics (tech platform, pedagogy, assessment, content), technical characteristics (emotion model, emotion category, emotion measurement channel, database, algorithm model) and outcome characteristics (technical result, educational application). We found that the primary purpose of these studies was to develop and evaluate systems for AER, rather than implementing these systems in real online learning environments. Furthermore, our findings indicated a lack of integration between computer science and educational science in the realm of AER. Despite the fact that most algorithm models demonstrated high accuracy in AER, the interpretability of the results was significantly constrained by the quality of the databases used, along with the scarcity of studies focusing on the effective and real-time application of AER results. These findings provide essential guidance for shaping future research and development pathways in this field.}

However, learners’ cognitive processes cannot be studied in isolation from the context; nevertheless, existing knowledge tracing models mainly use knowledge topology as auxiliary information but do not deeply explore the contextual information of exercises. Thus, an in-depth exploration of multi-layer contextual information in learning scenarios is required, focusing on the cognitive differences among different learners. Furthermore, knowledge tracing models exhibit limited interpretability compared with cognition diagnosis methods integrating educational priors. To address these issues, we propose a multi-layer context-aware deep knowledge tracing (MLC-DKT) model. Specifically, we first present the multi-layer contextual representation method involving knowledge concepts and exercises. In the knowledge state tracing module, we incorporate the learners’ knowledge priors into the attention mechanism to capture the evolution of the learners’ knowledge. Then, we develop a calculation method for the similarity effect among the contextual information, which helps estimate the learners’ knowledge states. In the learning performance prediction module, we introduce the guessing and slipping factors from the cognition diagnosis model to optimize the MLC-DKT model, further improving the performance of the KT model. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets, demonstrating that the MLC-DKT model provides improved predictions of learner performance. Moreover, the MLC-DKT model realizes contextual awareness from knowledge concepts and exercises, making the predictions more interpretable.}

Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT) is a technology developed in recent years that employs deep learning techniques to dynamically track students’ learning progress and offer personalized learning support. Yet, existing research often miss the complex interplay between student characteristics and knowledge components, limiting interpretability and adaptability in assessments. Addressing this gap, we introduce the Ontology Perceptible Knowledge Tracing (OPKT) model, a novel approach that reconceptualizes student-knowledge interaction by integrating both student and knowledge ontologies directly into the tracing process. This integration allows for a more nuanced representation of learning interactions, significantly enhancing the predictive precision and interpretability of the model. The OPKT model extracts and utilizes ontology features—deriving student attributes from behavioral data and aligning them with knowledge aspects through sophisticated relationship mapping. This dual-layer integration captures the evolution of knowledge states more accurately, facilitating targeted educational interventions. The results of prediction on two publicly available datasets demonstrate that our proposed OPKT model achieves at least a 2% improvement in AUC, accurately assessing students’ learning outcomes and knowledge proficiency. Additionally, we conducted dimensionality reduction experiments and ablation studies to validate the interpretability of the model.}

In this research, we propose EnsembleDL-ATG, an ensemble deep learning framework that aggregates multiple deep learning models to predict ATGs from protein sequence and evolutionary information. We first evaluated the performance of individual networks for various feature descriptors to identify the most promising models. Then, we explored all possible combinations of independent models to select the most effective ensemble architecture. The final framework was built and maintained by an organization of four different deep learning models. Experimental results show that our proposed method achieves a prediction accuracy of 94.5 % and MCC of 0.890, which are nearly 4 % and 0.08 higher than ATGPred-FL, respectively. Overall, EnsembleDL-ATG is the first ATG machine learning predictor based on ensemble deep learning.

Extended postponement of high-stakes exams due to health risk hereby reduces productivity and progress in later years. Several countries decided to organize the exams online. Since many other countries with large education boards had an inadequate infrastructure and insufficient resources during the emergency, education policy experts considered a solution to simultaneously protect public health and fully resume high-stakes exams -by canceling offline exam and introducing a uniform assessment process to be followed across the states and education boards. This research proposes a novel system using an AI model to accomplish the complex task of evaluating all students across education boards with maximum level of fairness and analyzes the ability to fairly appraise exam grades in the context of high-stakes examinations during SARS-CoV-2 emergency. Basically, a logistic regression classifier on top of a deep neural network is used to output predictions that are as fair as possible for all learners. The predictions of the proposed grade-awarding system are explained by the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) framework. SHAP allowed to identify the features of the students' portfolios that contributed most to the predicted grades. In the setting of an empirical analysis in one of the largest education systems in the Global South, 81.85% of learners were assigned fair scores while 3.12% of the scores were significantly smaller than the actual grades, which would have had a detrimental effect if it had been applied for real. Furthermore, SHAP allows policy-makers to debug the predictive model by identifying and measuring the importance of the factors involved in the model's final decision and removing those features that should not play a role in the model's “reasoning” process.}

abstract = {COVID-19 pandemic restrictions limited all social activities to curtail the spread of the virus. The foremost and most prime sector among those affected were schools, colleges, and universities. The education system of entire nations had shifted to online education during this time. Many shortcomings of Learning Management Systems (LMSs) were detected to support education in an online mode that spawned the research in Artificial Intelligence (AI) based tools that are being developed by the research community to improve the effectiveness of LMSs. This paper presents a detailed survey of the different enhancements to LMSs, which are led by key advances in the area of AI to enhance the real-time and non-real-time user experience. The AI-based enhancements proposed to the LMSs start from the Application layer and Presentation layer in the form of flipped classroom models for the efficient learning environment and appropriately designed UI/UX for efficient utilization of LMS utilities and resources, including AI-based chatbots. Session layer enhancements are also required, such as AI-based online proctoring and user authentication using Biometrics. These extend to the Transport layer to support real-time and rate adaptive encrypted video transmission for user security/privacy and satisfactory working of AI-algorithms. It also needs the support of the Networking layer for IP-based geolocation features, the Virtual Private Network (VPN) feature, and the support of Software-Defined Networks (SDN) for optimum Quality of Service (QoS). Finally, in addition to these, non-real-time user experience is enhanced by other AI-based enhancements such as Plagiarism detection algorithms and Data Analytics.}

This study suggests a new approach that deals with the current problems and provides more reliable predictions. The proposed approach combines the information gain (IG) and Laplacian score (LS) for feature selection. In this feature selection scheme, combination of IG and LS is used for ranking features and then, Sequential Forward Selection mechanism is used for determining the most relevant indicators. Also, combination of random forest algorithm with a genetic algorithm for is introduced for multi-class classification. This approach strives to attain more accuracy and reliability than current techniques. The case study shows the proposed strategy can predict performance of students with average accuracy of 93.11 % which shows a minimum improvement of 2.25 % compared to the baseline methods. The findings were further confirmed by the analysis of different evaluation metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F-Measure) to prove the efficiency of the proposed mechanism.}

This paper presents a qualitatively enhanced methodology for automated score prediction of subjective assignments. To consider all the major aspects of a human grader, 21 linguistic features related to syntactical, grammatical, sentimental, and readability are analyzed from the assignments. This study makes use of the ASAP competition dataset from Kaggle. The evaluation metric used is Quadratic Weighted Kappa (QWK), which measures the agreement between the human graded score and the predicted score. The effect of appropriate feature selection has been observed using Mutual Information Regression. Four ML algorithms are investigated on identified linguistic features. 3 Layer Neural Network with feature selection performed well among all chosen ML algorithms with average QWK of 0.678. To include the benefits of deep learning, a new hybrid model (LF-BiLSTM-att-FS) is proposed that combines a higher level deep neural network (DNN) with the selected features. Pre-trained Glove embedding is used to include contextual information of the text. The proposed model results demonstrated an improvement in overall accuracy, with an average QWK value of 0.768.}

Only once they have learned anything again may machines assist in your educational process. This study suggests a fresh approach to knowledge building in company management decision-making through the use of gaming and machine learning models.

We report on several findings: the degree of expertise correlates to behavioral patterns, whereby experts would rarely ask for help, and instead, predominantly provide help to other community members; the inclusion of an expert results in longer discussions. We propose a metric (the weighted sum), which enables us to better quantify the reputations of expert members of the community. We describe the use of four machine learning classifiers for the identification of both expert users and the most significant conversations within these communities. We propose a novel approach for a recommendation system, which utilizes semantic annotations to identify topical experts and to ascertain their respective area of specialism. We foresee the suitability of our expertise-finding methods and findings to support Learning Analytics, and in scenarios where users may apply lessons learnt from our results to improve their status in a community. Our findings can also inform systems for recommending experts and discussions.}

This study implements geospatial hot spot, correlation, and decision tree analyses to investigate the impacts of environmental factors and truck traffic loads on asphalt pavement performance. A pavement database with 1725 asphalt pavement sections from the Long-Term Pavement Performance (LTPP) program was built and analyzed using geospatial hot spot analysis to characterize the spatial patterns of environmental factors, truck traffic loads, and asphalt pavement distresses in different climatic regions across the United States and Canada. The statistical correlation analysis was conducted to identify significant correlations among hot spots of environmental factors, truck traffic loads, and asphalt pavement distresses. The decision tree model, which is a supervised machine learning method, was used to assess pavement performance in an area that is associated with higher risks of distress based on contributing environmental and traffic conditions. The hot spot analysis showed that the pavement sections located in the dry no-freeze region had higher percentages of hot spots of truck traffic loads and associated load-induced distresses, such as fatigue cracking, longitudinal wheel path cracking, and rutting. In the dry no-freeze region, higher percentages of pavement sections were also classified as hot spots of transverse cracking. The pavement sections in the wet freeze region are more likely to experience longitudinal non-wheel path cracking and surface roughness. The decision tree models were built to identify the likeliness of hot spots of asphalt pavement distresses using environmental factors and truck traffic loads. These decision tree models provide enhanced decision-making information in pavement design and maintenance.}

This paper proposes a principled method that aims to achieve personalized, accurate, and efficient grouping outcomes. Dubbed as Personas-based Student Grouping (PSG), our method first applies unsupervised clustering techniques to assign personas to students based on their behavioral characteristics. Based on their personas, we then utilize deep reinforcement learning to search for appropriate grouping rules and perform linear programming to obtain a suitable grouping scheme. Finally, the teaching effectiveness is fed back as the rewards to the reinforcement learning model to optimize future grouping scheme selections. Extensive experiments conducted on MOOCs datasets show that PSG can achieve more advantageous performance in both efficiency and effectiveness compared to the manual or random grouping mechanism. We hope PSG can provide students with a more enhanced learning experience and contribute to the future development of education. Our project homepage is available at https://PSG-project.pages.dev.}

In a computer-aided 3D design context, this study used cluster analysis to identify SDL behavioral patterns based on the trace data of 193 middle school students and further examined the differences in the perceived SDL ability and creative performance. Four distinct SDL behavioral patterns were identified: fully engaged, planning and reflection engaged, execution and regulation engaged, and minimally engaged learners. There were significant differences in the perceived SDL ability and creative performance between the four SDL behavioral patterns. The fully engaged learners showed the highest levels of perceived SDL ability and creative performance; the minimally engaged learners showed the lowest levels of perceived SDL ability and creative performance; the planning and reflection engaged learners had higher levels of perceived SDL ability and creative performance than the execution and regulation engaged learners. The findings provide insights for better understanding SDL from a behavioral perspective and for effective incorporation of SDL in a design context.}

abstract = {For intelligent tutoring systems, Cognitive Diagnosis (CD) is a fundamental task that aims to estimate the mastery degree of a student on each skill according to the exercise record. The CD task is considered rather challenging since we need to model inner-relations and inter-relations among students, skills, and questions to obtain more abundant information. Most existing methods attempt to solve this problem through two-way interactions between students and questions (or between students and skills), ignoring potential high-order relations among entities. Furthermore, how to construct an end-to-end framework that can model the complex interactions among different types of entities at the same time remains unexplored. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a graph-based Cognitive Diagnosis model (GCDM) that directly discovers the interactions among students, skills, and questions through a heterogeneous cognitive graph. Specifically, we design two graph-based layers: a performance-relative propagator and an attentive knowledge aggregator. The former is applied to propagate a student’s cognitive state through different types of graph edges, while the latter selectively gathers messages from neighboring graph nodes. Extensive experimental results on two real-world datasets clearly show the effectiveness and extendibility of our proposed model.}

Nevertheless, the utilization of lithium-ion batteries face a core difficulty associated with environmental degradation factors, capacity fade, aging-induced degradation, and end-of-life repurposing. These factors play a pivotal role in the field of EVs. In this regard, state-of-health (SOH) and remaining useful life (RUL) estimation outlines the efficacy of the batteries as well as facilitate in the development and testing of numerous EV optimizations with identification of parameters that will enhance and further improve their efficiency. Both indices give an accurate estimation of the battery performance, maintenance, prognostics, and health management. Accordingly, machine learning (ML) techniques provide a significant developmental scope as best parameters and approaches cannot be identified for these estimations. ML strategies comparatively provide a non-invasive approach with low computation and high accuracy considering the scalability and timescale issues of battery degradation. This paper objectively provides an inclusively extensive review on these topics based on the research conducted over the past decade. An in-depth introductory is provided for SOH and RUL estimation highlighting their process and significance. Furthermore, numerous ML techniques are thoroughly and independently investigated based on each category and sub-category implemented for SOH and RUL measurement. Finally, applications-oriented discussion that explicates the advantages in terms of accuracy and computation is presented that targets to provide an insight for further development in this field of research.}

Using data from 32 Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development countries from the latest cycle of the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2018 reading dataset, this study combines an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm and hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) to examine the effects of student-level and school-level ICT-related factors in the blended learning setting on students' reading performance. Results show that students' perceived autonomy and competence in ICT, preference for different reading formats, quality of school ICT resources and school ICT use policies are positively related to reading performance, whereas school ICT use support for teachers and the teaching of ICT skills are negatively related to students' reading scores. The quadratic effects of students' interests in ICT, family and school ICT resources, and ICT uses are identified, showing an inverted U-shaped trend. The possible linear and quadratic moderation effects of school-level ICT-related features are also investigated. This study invites consideration of a combination of analytical methods for a comprehensive exploration of reading education and sheds light on how the delicate association of multilevel ICT factors in blended learning settings can contribute to the improvement of reading education. Instructors in blended learning settings should effectively integrate technology and appropriately apply pedagogies, and the design of blended learning should be sustainable and learner-friendly to exploit students’ learning potential.}

abstract = {The goal of Knowledge Tracing (KT) is to estimate how well students have mastered a concept based on their historical learning of related exercises. The benefit of knowledge tracing is that students’ learning plans can be better organised and adjusted, and interventions can be made when necessary. With the recent rise of deep learning, Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT) has utilised Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to accomplish this task with some success. Other works have attempted to introduce Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and redefine the task accordingly to achieve significant improvements. However, these efforts suffer from at least one of the following drawbacks: (1) they pay too much attention to details of the nodes rather than to high-level semantic information; (2) they struggle to effectively establish spatial associations and complex structures of the nodes; and (3) they represent either concepts or exercises only, without integrating them. Inspired by recent advances in self-supervised learning, we propose a Bi-Graph Contrastive Learning based Knowledge Tracing (Bi-CLKT) to address these limitations. Specifically, we design a two-layer comparative learning scheme based on an “exercise-to-exercise” (E2E) relational subgraph. It involves node-level contrastive learning of subgraphs to obtain discriminative representations of exercises, and graph-level contrastive learning to obtain discriminative representations of concepts. Moreover, we designed a joint contrastive loss to obtain better representations and hence better prediction performance. Also, we explored two different variants, using RNN and memory-augmented neural networks as the prediction layer for comparison to obtain better representations of exercises and concepts respectively. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets show that the proposed Bi-CLKT and its variants outperform other baseline models.}

The proposed approach is devised to generate instances, which are augmented with the actual data to eliminate class imbalance. A performance comparison of the proposed SC-GAN with the standard up-sampling methods is also presented and the results validate the proposed method with an improved AUC of 7.07% and 6.53%, respectively, when compared with conventional Random Over-sampling and Sythetic Minority Oversampling techniques.}

Ausubel’s cognitive theory underscores the significance of cognitive accumulation in learning, perceiving it as a process in which new content is linked and integrated with students’ existing knowledge. Yet, current studies often overlook this cognitive property and its impact on performance prediction. Therefore, we propose an attention-based knowledge tracing model, named Student State-aware knowledge tracing (SSKT). To align with this cognitive process, we incorporate suitable Query, Key, and Value objects into the attention mechanism, effectively modeling how students extract, integrate, and apply information from their existing knowledge. Meanwhile, traditional RNN-based models encounter the issue of losing early learning data due to gradient vanishing in long sequences. Our hybrid model, which combines LSTM and Transformer, efficiently extracts early learning information using an attention mechanism. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate the effectiveness and interpretability of SSKT.}

In this sense, a series of adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) proposed models were trained using these methods. The selection of the best-fit model depends on finding an excellent connection between inputs and output(s) layers in training and testing datasets (e.g., a combination of expert knowledge, experimentation, and validation techniques). The study's primary result is a division of the participants into two performance-based groups (failed and non-failed). The experimental data used to build the models measured fourteen process variables: relocation, gender, age at enrollment, debtor, nationality, educational special needs, current tuition fees, scholarship holder, unemployment, inflation, GDP, application order, day/evening attendance, and admission grade. During the model evaluation, a scoring system was created in addition to using mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and area under the curve (AUC) to assess the efficacy of the utilized approaches. Further research revealed that the HHO-ANFIS is superior to the EWA-ANFIS. With AUC = 0.8004 and 0.7886, MSE of 0.62689 and 0.65598, and MAE of 0.64105 and 0.65746, the failure of the pupils was assessed with the most significant degree of accuracy. The MSE, MAE, and AUC precision indicators showed that the EWA-ANFIS is less accurate, having MSE amounts of 0.71543 and 0.71776, MAE amounts of 0.70819 and 0.71518, and AUC amounts of 0.7565 and 0.758. It was found that the optimization algorithms have a high ability to increase the accuracy and performance of the conventional ANFIS model in predicting students' performance, which can cause changes in the management of the educational system and improve the quality of academic programs.}

Despite a growing number of studies exploring factors for successful online learning outcomes, most researchers have utilised one or a combination of very few learner characteristics. Moreover, a limited number of studies scrutinised the impact of individual characteristics on learning outcomes as learners progress in a course. The current research aims to explore the dynamic impact of demographic characteristics on academic outcomes in the online learning environment. We investigated and compared the dynamic influence of six demographic characteristics on online learning outcomes using a sample of 8581 UK based learners across four Open University online courses from four different disciplines. We found region, neighborhood poverty level, and prior education respectively, to be strong predictors of overall learning outcomes. However, at a fine-grain level, such influence varied temporally as the course progressed, as well as between different courses. To conclude with, we discussed the implications for institutional support on adopting a tailored approach towards a more personalised student support system.}

abstract = {Uncertainty is a key feature of any machine learning model and is particularly important in neural networks, which tend to be overconfident. This overconfidence is worrying under distribution shifts, where the model performance silently degrades as the data distribution diverges from the training data distribution. Uncertainty estimation offers a solution to overconfident models, communicating when the output should (not) be trusted. Although methods for uncertainty estimation have been developed, they have not been explicitly linked to the field of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). Furthermore, literature in operations research ignores the actionability component of uncertainty estimation and does not consider distribution shifts. This work proposes a general uncertainty framework, with contributions being threefold: (i) uncertainty estimation in ML models is positioned as an XAI technique, giving local and model-specific explanations; (ii) classification with rejection is used to reduce misclassifications by bringing a human expert in the loop for uncertain observations; (iii) the framework is applied to a case study on neural networks in educational data mining subject to distribution shifts. Uncertainty as XAI improves the model’s trustworthiness in downstream decision-making tasks, giving rise to more actionable and robust machine learning systems in operations research.}

abstract = {Predicting student outcomes is essential in educational analytics for creating personalised learning experiences. The effectiveness of these predictive models relies on having access to sufficient and accurate data. However, privacy concerns and the lack of student consent often restrict data collection, limiting the applicability of predictive models. To tackle this obstacle, we employ Generative Adversarial Networks, a type of Generative AI, to generate tabular data replicating and enlarging the dimensions of two distinct publicly available student datasets. The ‘Math dataset’ has 395 observations and 33 features, whereas the ‘Exam dataset’ has 1000 observations and 8 features. Using advanced Python libraries, Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Networks and Copula Generative Adversarial Networks, our methodology consists of two phases. First, a mirroring approach where we produce synthetic data matching the volume of the real datasets, focusing on privacy and evaluating predictive accuracy. Second, augmenting the real datasets with newly created synthetic observations to fill gaps in datasets that lack student data. We validate the synthetic data before employing these approaches using Correlation Analysis, Density Analysis, Correlation Heatmaps, and Principal Component Analysis. We then compare the predictive accuracy of whether students will pass or fail their exams across original, synthetic, and augmented datasets. Employing Feedforward Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, and Gradient-boosted Neural Networks, and using Bayesian optimisation for hyperparameter tuning, this research methodically examines the impact of synthetic data on prediction accuracy. We implement and optimize these models using Python. Our mirroring approach aims to achieve accuracy rates that closely align with the original data. Meanwhile, our augmenting approach seeks to reach a slightly higher accuracy level than when solely learning from the original data. Our findings provide actionable insights into leveraging advanced Generative AI techniques to enhance educational outcomes and meet our objectives successfully.}

abstract = {Predicting students’ course grades has important university-related applications, such as providing predictive assistance to students who may fail to graduate. However, it is a quite challenging task. On the one hand, each student has very limited historical course grades. On the other hand, a student may exhibit very different performance on different types of courses. As a result, most existing grade prediction methods don’t address such challenges and cannot achieve good results. Through empirical data analysis, we find that a group of students achieve similar grades over a set of similar courses. Based on the observations, we first construct student-course graphs, student-student graphs and course-course graphs to capture student-course dependency, student similarity and course similarity, respectively. Then, we propose a model named DGTEAM to specifically deal with these three dynamic graphs to obtain the representations of students and courses. The obtained representations of each course and student are applied to predict the grades. We conduct experiments on a real-world dataset and the result verifies the superiority of our model.}

A simplified IGB model of the shallow UTES was developed using thermal network analysis. Experimental studies were conducted for shallow vertical and horizontal UTES configurations. Detailed models representing the field experiments were developed using the TRNSYS simulation tool and calibrated with the measured data from the experimental setup. The 4 Resistance 2 Capacitance (4R2C) IGB model was trained and tested in MATLAB using field experimental data and the data from the calibrated TRNSYS model. In comparing experimental data with the TRNSYS model for UTES, the prediction of outlet water temperature showed good agreement, with root mean square error (RMSE) and coefficient of variation of RMSE (CVRMSE) values of 0.94 °C and 3.16 % for vertical, and 0.99 °C and 2.97 % for horizontal configurations. The IGB model also aligned well with the experimental data, showing CVRMSE of 7.91 % and 3.17 % for vertical and horizontal systems, respectively. Sensitivity analysis revealed that model performance improves with longer training durations and closer testing times to training periods. However, a convergence point of 20 weeks of training data was achieved for making long-term performance predictions.}

Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was used to explore assessment factors and formulate the model. Then, the constructed model was verified by confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). AMADEUS consists of 12 factors in 4 components: responsibility, interest in course material, class participation, and honesty. The experimental results indicated that AMADEUS was consistent with the empirical data and passed all criteria for consideration. After that, an assessment and reporting tool called MOZART has been developed. MOZART employed the AMADEUS model to assess students’ affective domain from log files using Hadoop and ELK stack technologies.

However, these studies face two major shortcomings in KT: 1) they only consider “exercise-to-concept” relationships; 2) the multi-hot embeddings lack interpretability. In order to address the above issues, we propose a Joint graph convolutional network based deep Knowledge Tracing (JKT) framework to model the multi-dimensional relationships of “exercise-to-exercise”, and “concept-to-concept” into graph and fuse them with “exercise-to-concept” relationships. In JKT, it is not only possible to establish connections between exercises under cross-concepts, but also to help capture high-level semantic information and increase the model’s interpretability. In addition, sufficient experiments conducted on four real-world datasets have demonstrated that JKT performs better than the other baseline models. We further illustrate a case study to demonstrate its interpretability for learning analysis}

abstract = {To construct dialogue-based Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) with sufficient pedagogical expertise, a trendy research method is to mine large-scale data collected by existing dialogue-based ITS or generated between human tutors and students to discover effective tutoring strategies. However, most of the existing research has mainly focused on the analysis of successful tutorial dialogue. We argue that, to better inform the design of dialogue-based ITS, it is also important to analyse unsuccessful tutorial dialogues and gain a better understanding of the reasons behind those failures. Therefore, our study aimed to identify effective tutoring strategies by mining a large-scale dataset of both successful and unsuccessful human–human online tutorial dialogues, and further used these tutoring strategies for predicting students’ problem-solving performance. Specifically, the study adopted a widely-used educational dialogue act scheme to describe the action behind utterances made by a tutor/student in the broader context of a tutorial dialogue (e.g., asking/answering a question, providing hints). Frequent dialogue acts were identified and analysed by taking into account the prior progress that a student had made before the start of a tutorial session and the problem-solving performance the student achieved after the end of the session. Besides, we performed a sequence analysis on the inferred actions to identify prominent patterns that were closely related to students’ problem-solving performance. These prominent patterns could shed light on the frequent strategies used by tutors. Lastly, we measured the power of these tutorial actions in predicting students’ problem-solving performance by applying a well-established machine learning method, Gradient Tree Boosting (GTB). Through extensive analysis and evaluations, we identified a set of different action patterns that were pertinent to tutors and students across dialogues of different traits, e.g., students without prior progress in solving problems, compared to those with prior progress, were likely to receive more thought-provoking questions from their tutors. More importantly, we demonstrated that the actions taken by students and tutors during a tutorial process could not adequately predict student performance and should be considered together with other relevant factors (e.g., the informativeness of the utterances).}

Educational disparities in Mathematics performance are a persistent challenge. This study aims to unravel the complex factors contributing to these disparities among students internationally, with a focus on the interpretability of the contributing factors.
Methodology:
Utilizing data from the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), we conducted rigorous preprocessing and variable selection to prepare for applying binary classification interpretability models. These models were trained using the Stratified K-Fold technique to ensure balanced representation and assessed using six key metrics.
Solution:
By applying interpretability models such as Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) analysis, we identified critical factors impacting student performance, including reading accessibility, critical thinking skills, gender, and geographical location.
Results:
Our findings reveal significant disparities linked to resource availability, with students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds possessing fewer books and demonstrating lower performance in Mathematics. The geographical analysis highlighted regional educational disparities, with certain areas consistently underperforming in PISA assessments. Gender also emerged as a determinant, with females contributing differently to performance levels across the spectrum.
Conclusion:
The study provides insights into the multifaceted determinants of student Mathematics performance and suggests potential avenues for future research to explore global interpretability models and further investigate the socioeconomic, cultural, and educational factors at play.}

abstract = {E-learning, remote learning systems, and hybrid models were necessary in the pandemics age and when cities are rapidly moving towards smart city status. Adaptive and individualized education is now a must to reduce the drawbacks of distance learning while ensuring high levels of accomplishment. Technology such as machine learning, artificial intelligence (XAI), and data mining are all helping to transform education in a smart city by allowing for personalized learning and the ability to tailor content based on individual preferences. Based on the combination of XAI and IoB technologies, this study proposes a new paradigm for smart educational systems. Using data on students' actions, researchers try to establish whether or not contemporary educational systems meet students' needs. Education systems have evolved, but not to the point where they can be personalized to meet the cognitive demands of students and assist them when face-to-face instruction isn't available. Using evaluation methods, the study found that there has been a shift in students' academic progress when monitoring using IoT/IoB to enable a relative response in support of their progression. The system response to learners was 37%, once we involve the IoB in the processes and let students and the system be aware of the collected and used data about students' behaviours, the student's response improved to 76 % . This indicates the major influence of IoB on learner assistance and system adaptations to their real demands for higher achievement.}

Due to their ability to uncover underlying semantically relevant patterns, they are of particular interest in data mining research and applicable in both unsupervised and supervised learning scenarios. With the aim of increasing the stability and expressiveness of the classical, non-gradual RARs, Gradual Relational Association Rules (GRARs) have been introduced. By generalizing the boolean relations to gradual relations, GRARs also capture the degrees to which generic relations are satisfied. In the current paper we introduce a new approach called DynGRAR (Dynamic Gradual Relational Association Rules Miner) for uncovering interesting GRARs in dynamic data sets which are incrementally extended with both new data instances and new data attributes. DynGRAR dynamically adjusts the set of all interesting GRARs. Through multiple experiments performed on publicly available software defect prediction data sets, we have evaluated DynGRAR versus applying the standard GRARs mining algorithm from scratch on the extended data. The results obtained emphasize the superior performance of the dynamic approach we propose.}

Unlike the previous educational technology iterations, which are limited to instrumental use for providing platforms to build learning applications, AI has proposed a unique education laboratory by enabling students to explore an instrument that functions as a dynamic system of computational concepts. However, the extent of the implications of AI adaptation in modern education is yet to be explored. Motivated to fill the literature gap and to consider the emerging significance of AI in education, this paper aims to analyze the possible intertwined relationship between students’ intrinsic motivation for learning Artificial Intelligence during the COVID-19 pandemic; the relationship between students’ computational thinking and understanding of AI concepts; and the underlying dynamic relation, if existing, between AI and computational thinking building efforts. To investigate the mentioned relationships, the present empirical study employs mediation analysis based upon collected 137 survey data from Universidad Politécnica de Madrid students in the Institute for Educational Science and the School of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering during the first quarter of 2022. Findings show that intrinsic motivation mediates the relationship between perceived Artificial Intelligence learning and computational thinking. Also, the research indicates that intrinsic motivation has a significant relationship with computational thinking and perceived Artificial Intelligence learning.}

Existing efforts typically learn question-response representations in a supervised manner, thus inevitably neglecting to excavate implicit information existed in student-question-concept connections and suffering from the issue of data sparsity due to rare student-question interactions. Inspired by the recent success of self-supervised learning, in this paper, we propose a Question-Response representation with dual-level Contrastive Learning (QRCL) for improving knowledge tracing, to address the aforementioned problems. Our approach comprehensively considers three types of views for obtaining question-response representations: the native fold views derived from native interaction between students and questions, the augmented fold views generated by contrastive augmentation with Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), and the co-response relation views acquired by means of correlation among questions. By using delicately designed contrastive rules, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are adopted as backbone to encode the information from each view for better generating question-response representation. Extensive experimental results conducted on five datasets clearly show our proposed method has the capability in effectively predicting students' performances.}

Traditionally, cognitive diagnostic models (CDMs) have evolved from manually designed probabilistic graphical models to sophisticated automated learning models employing neural networks. Despite their enhanced fitting capabilities, contemporary neuro-cognitive diagnostic models frequently overlook critical process information from students and suffer from reduced interpretability. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a neuro-cognitive diagnostic model that integrates multidimensional features (MFNCD) by incorporating students’ response time as process information. This approach facilitates the simultaneous modeling of students’ response accuracy and response speed using neural networks, thereby enhancing both the fitting capability and precision of the method. Furthermore, a multi-channel attention mechanism is employed to effectively capture the complex interactions between students and exercise characteristics, simulating the process of students answering questions and thereby improving the model's interpretability. Validated on four diverse datasets, MFNCD model demonstrates superior accuracy compared to other state-of-the-art (SOAT) baseline models. Additionally, our experiments confirm significant correlations between cognitive attributes, revealing interesting educational patterns, such as a positive correlation between speed and ability, and between ability and accuracy. These findings provide deeper insights into learning patterns that incorporate multidimensional features and suggest potential pathways for targeted educational interventions.}

Traditional psychometrical frameworks lack the ability to extract rich representations of exercises or examinees. Deep learning KT models have shown comparable performances, but uninterpretable model parameters have limited their applications. Furthermore, existing frameworks usually cannot handle temporal factors appropriately, as most of them simply apply stochastic processes to simulate fluctuations on knowledge states over time. In this paper, we propose a new framework named Time-and-Concept Enhanced Deep Multidimensional Item Response Theory (TC-MIRT) that integrates the parameters of a Multidimensional Item Response Theory into an improved recurrent neural network. Specifically, two enhanced components are constructed to empower our model with the ability to perform trend forecasting and to generate explainable parameters in each specific domain of knowledge. Experiments implemented on two real-world datasets show that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art KT approaches on performance prediction tasks. Moreover, extensive case analyses also demonstrate that the interpretable parameters of TC-MIRT can be used to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of students.}

abstract = {Knowledge Tracing (KT) focuses on modeling the exercise process of students, assessing their knowledge state changes during the exercise process, and further providing targeted guidance for teaching and learning. Current KT models have made significant progress by utilizing deep learning technologies to model relevant attributes of the questions. However, in current knowledge tracing strategies, we have yet to exhaustively explore how to precisely evaluate the hierarchies of students’ knowledge mastery to better discern their current target hierarchy. To address the limitations of the KT model in accurately identifying and positioning target hierarchy, our research focuses on two key areas: first, we dynamically track students’ target hierarchies by evaluating their feedback on questions at different hierarchies ; second, we assess their actual question-solving abilities within these target hierarchies, thereby optimizing our evaluation of their knowledge status. Based on these insights, we propose the Target Hierarchy-guided Knowledge Tracing (THKT) model. In this model, we first incorporate the identification of question hierarchy into the model representation. Then, to avoid homogenization of the target hierarchy, we dynamically track the appropriate hierarchy for students based on their varying feedback to questions of the same hierarchy, thereby pinpointing their learning target hierarchies. Simultaneously, we develop a KCs applied ability learning module that works in conjunction with the target hierarchies to generate interpretable prediction results. The proposed THKT model has been tested and evaluated using three public, real-world educational datasets. The findings clearly demonstrate that our approach shines in the realm of KT prediction tasks, providing significantly interpretability. For broader research, we plan to provide the source code at: https://github.com/xinjiesun-ustc/THKT to ensure accessibility and promote further innovation in this field.}

Accurate monitoring of pan evaporation (Ep) is one the most popular approaches to understand the evaporative process. This work aims to construct a hybrid Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) predictive model that is coupled with Neighbourhood Component Analysis for feature selection to predict Ep in drought-prone regions in Queensland, Australia (Amberley, Gatton, Oakey, & Townsville). Utilizing the daily-scale dataset [31 August 2002 to 22 September 2020], the performance of the proposed deep learning (DL) hybrid model, denoted as NCA-LSTM, is compared with competitive benchmark models, i.e., standalone LSTM, other types of DL, single hidden layer neuronal architecture and decision tree-based method. The testing results reveal the lowest Relative Root Mean Square Error ≤20%, Absolute Percentage Bias ≤14.5% and the highest Kling-Gupta Efficiency ≥87% attained by the NCA-LSTM hybrid model (relative to benchmark models) tested for Amberley, Gatton, and Oakey sites. In respect to the predictive efficiency, the proposed NCA-LSTM hybrid model, improved with feature selection, outperforms all benchmark models, indicating its future utility in the prediction of daily Ep. In practical sense, the predictive model developed for Ep estimation provides an accurate estimation of evaporative water loss in hydrological cycle and therefore, can be implemented in areas of irrigation management, planning of irrigation-based agriculture, and mitigation of financial losses to agricultural and related sectors where, regular monitoring and forecasting of water resources are a vital part of sustainable livelihood and business.}

abstract = {Knowledge Tracing (KT) aims to continuously estimate students’ evolving knowledge state during their learning process, which has attracted much research attention due to its potential for delivering personalized and optimal experiences to students in intelligent learning systems. The learning process is essentially the pairwise interactions of Students, Concepts, and Questions (S–C, S–Q, C–Q for short). Modeling all these interactions will improve the performance of KT. However, existing KT methods hardly exploit all the interactions in a single model. Specifically, Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) and most of its variants neglect C–Q; Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT) and other deep neural network approaches mostly neglect S–Q and C–Q. We propose the Ensemble Knowledge Tracing (EnKT), which models all three types of interactions. The base model of EnKT is a hybrid of BKT and DKT. We also present an ensemble algorithm Recurrent Boosting (RB), which extends AdaBoost to deal with KT sequential data. Inspired by BKT, EnKT represents S–C and S–Q using learning and performance parameters, respectively. Besides, EnKT defines C–Q as the correlation complexity among the concepts involved in a question. Experiments show EnKT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods (by up to 6% in AUC in some cases) on four real-world benchmark datasets and illustrate better interpretability by several typical case studies.}

This study is one of the first to examine the impact of data quality and data latency on process control and quality analysis which are elemental parts of daily QMS activities, from a supply chain visibility (SCV) perspective. In this study, five propositions are made to show the relationships between technology, SCV, and data issues. More importantly, the study proposes a platform that integrates Blockchain (BC) technology, Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), and Big Data to solve data problems in SCV and QMS. We further perform fuzzy association rule mining (FARM) to show how the platform can solve quality analysis problems and complete a closed-loop process control cycle in manufacturing. We also explain the contributions of the integrated platform to QMS from four theoretical perspectives. Finally, we discuss the limitations of the platform and provide recommendations for future research.}

It is however challenging to select the exercises with reasonable difficulty for students as they have different learning status and the size of exercise bank is quite large. The classic collaborative filtering (CF) based recommendation methods rely heavily on the similarities among students or exercises, leading to recommend exercises with mismatched difficulty. This paper proposes a novel exercise recommendation method, which uses Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to predict the coverage of knowledge concepts, and uses Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT) to predict students’ mastery level of knowledge concepts based on the student’s exercise answer records. The predictive results are utilized to filter the exercises; therefore, a subset of exercise bank is generated. As such, a complete list of recommended exercises can be obtained by solving an optimization problem. Extensive experimental studies show that our proposed approach has advantages over some existing baseline methods, not only in terms of the evaluation of difficulty of recommended exercises, but also the diversity and novelty of the recommendation lists.}

abstract = {In graph few-shot learning, few-shot node classification (FSNC) at the node-level is a popular downstream task. Previous FSNC methods primarily rely on meta-learning or metric learning techniques, aiming to mine prior knowledge from the base classes. However, these methods still have some limitations that need to be addressed, namely: (1) conducting multiple tasks for parameter initialization leads to expensive time costs. (2) ignoring the rich information present in novel classes leads to model over-fitting. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel graph augmentation method for FSNC on graph data, which includes both parameter initialization and parameter fine-tuning. Specifically, the parameter initialization conducts only one multi-classification task on the base classes, improving generalization ability and reducing time costs. The parameter fine-tuning is designed to include two data augmentation modules (i.e., support augmentation and shot augmentation) on the novel classes to mine the rich information, thus alleviating model over-fitting. As a result, this paper introduces the first graph augmentation method for FSNC. Experimental results showed that our method achieves supreme performance, compared with state-of-the-art FSNC methods.}

However, they have not been broadly applied to solve the multi-instance multi-label (MIML) problem, a supervised learning paradigm that combines multi-instance (MI) and multi-label (ML) learning. This work presents new neighbor-based approaches for solving MIML problems. On the one hand, MIML data are transformed into ML data and ML nearest neighbor algorithms are used. On the other hand, algorithms that directly address MIML data and use a bag-based distance are proposed. A comprehensive study and an overall comparison have been conducted to study the performance of these methods using different configurations. Experiments included 16 datasets and 8 performance metrics. The results and statistical tests showed that the problem transformation applied and the distance function used impacted the performance and that the approaches that do not transform the problem obtained the best predictive results. Furthermore, most of the proposed algorithms outperformed the MIMLkNN algorithm, the state-of-art algorithm for MIML learning based on nearest-neighbor. Therefore, the relevance and capabilities of neighbor-based approaches to obtain competitive results in MIML learning are shown. Finally, all the algorithms developed in this paper have been included in the MIML library to facilitate the comparison with other future proposals.}

abstract = {Studies have demonstrated that stochastic configuration networks (SCNs) have good potential for rapid data modeling because of their sufficient adequate learning power, which is theoretically guaranteed. Empirical studies have verified that the learner models produced by SCNs can usually achieve favorable test performance in practice but more in-depth theoretical analysis of their generalization power would be useful for constructing SCN-based ensemble models with enhanced generalization capacities. In particular, given a collection of independently developed SCN-based learner models, it is useful to select certain base learners that can potentially obtain preferable test results rather than considering all of the base models together, before simply taking their average in order to build an effective ensemble model. In this study, we propose a novel framework for building SCN ensembles by exploring key factors that might potentially affect the generalization performance of the base model. Under a mild assumption, we provide a comprehensive theoretical framework for examining a learner model’s generalization error, as well as formulating a novel indicator that contains measurement information for the training errors, output weights, and a hidden layer output matrix, which can be used by our proposed algorithm to find a subset of appropriate base models from a pool of randomized learner models. A toy example of one-dimensional function approximation, a case study for developing a predictive model for forecasting student learning performance, and two large-scale data sets were used in our experiments. The experimental results indicate that our proposed method has some remarkable advantages for building ensemble models.}

abstract = {The outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020 inhibited face-to-face education and constrained exam taking. In many countries worldwide, high-stakes exams happening at the end of the school year determine college admissions. This paper investigates the impact of using historical data of school and high-stakes exams results to train a model to predict high-stakes exams given the available data in the Spring. The most transparent and accurate model turns out to be a linear regression model with high school GPA as the main predictor. Further analysis of the predictions reflect how high-stakes exams relate to GPA in high school for different subgroups in the population. Predicted scores slightly advantage females and low SES individuals, who perform relatively worse in high-stakes exams than in high school. Our preferred model accounts for about 50% of the out-of-sample variation in the high-stakes exam. On average, the student rank using predicted scores differs from the actual rank by almost 17 percentiles. This suggests that either high-stakes exams capture individual skills that are not measured by high school grades or that high-stakes exams are a noisy measure of the same skill.}

abstract = {Recently the large-scale influence of Covid-19 promoted the fast development of intelligent tutoring systems (ITS). As a major task of ITS, Knowledge Tracing (KT) aims to capture a student’s dynamic knowledge state based on his historical response sequences and provide personalized learning assistance to him. However, most existing KT methods have encountered the data sparsity problem. In real scenarios, an online tutoring system usually has an extensive collection of questions while each student can only interact with a limited number of questions. As a result, the records of some questions could be extremely sparse, which degrades the performance of traditional KT models. To resolve this issue, we propose a Dual-channel Heterogeneous Graph Network (DHGN) to learn informative representations of questions from students’ records by capturing both the high-order heterogeneous and local relations. As the supervised learning manner applied in previous methods is incapable of exploiting unobserved relations between questions, we innovatively integrate a self-supervised framework into the KT task and employ contrastive learning via the two channels of DHGN, supplementing as an auxiliary task to improve the KT performance. Moreover, we adopt the attention mechanism, which has achieved impressive performance in natural language processing tasks, to effectively capture students’ knowledge state. But the standard attention network is inapplicable to the KT task because the current knowledge state of a student usually shows strong dependency on his recently interactive questions, unlike the situation of language processing tasks, which focus more on the long-term dependency. To avoid the inefficiency of standard attention networks in the KT task, we further devise a novel Hybrid Attentive Network (HAN), which produces both the global attention and the hierarchical local attention to model the long-term and short-term intents, respectively. Then, by the gating network, a student’s long-term and short-term intents are combined for efficient prediction. We conduct extensive experiments on several real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed methods achieve significant performance improvement compared to existing state-of-the-art baselines, which validates the effectiveness of the proposed dual-channel heterogeneous graph framework and hybrid attentive network.}

The model utilizes short-term preferences reconstruction behavior contribution to identify fluctuations in learners' interests in real-time. A model for recommending courses is proposed based on short-term preferences and enhancements to learning behavior. Its purpose is to tackle the issue of generalization arising from sparsity and weak correlation in learning behavior. The outcomes demonstrated the model put forth in the study achieved higher Hit Rate (HR) and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG) values in comparison experiments with multiple models. Hence, this suggested that creating a novel component of historical learning behavior, powered by dynamic interest factors, could resolve the issue of changing learning interests and enhance the efficacy of course recommendation models. Furthermore, the introduction of a correlation mapping network enables the forward mapping transformation from weak to strong learning behavior, thus improving and optimizing input for the agent strategy, reducing data sparsity, and enhancing the performance and generalization of the course recommendation model.}

Traditional laboratory methods for detecting 4mC DNA methylation have limitations, but the rise of artificial intelligence has introduced efficient computational strategies for 4mC site prediction. Despite this progress, challenges persist in terms of model performance and interpretability. To tackle these challenges, we propose DeepSF-4mC, a deep learning model specifically designed for predicting DNA cytosine 4mC methylation sites by leveraging sequence features. Our approach incorporates multiple encoding techniques to enhance prediction accuracy, increase model stability, and reduce the computational resources needed. Leveraging transfer learning, we harness existing models to enhance performance through learned representations or fine-tuning. Ensemble learning techniques combine predictions from multiple models, boosting robustness and accuracy.

This paper proposes a fuzzy-embedded recurrent neural network (FE-RNN) to improve interpretability of the underlying neural networks. It is a parallel deep structure comprising an RNN and a Pseudo Outer-Product based Fuzzy Neural Network (POPFNN) that share a common set of input and output linguistic concepts. The inference processes undertaken are associated by RNN using fuzzy rules in the embedded POPFNN. Fuzzy IF-THEN rules provide better interpretability of the inference process of the hybrid networks. It allows an effective realisation of a data driven implication using RNN in the modelling of fuzzy entailment within a fuzzy neural networks (FNN) structure. FE-RNN obtains more consistent results than other FNN in the experiment using the Mackey-Glass dataset. FE-RNN achieves about 99% correlation for forecasting prices of market indexes. Its interpretability is also discussed. FE-RNN then acts as a prediction tool in a financial trading system using forecast-assisted technical indicators optimised with Genetic Algorithms. It outperforms the benchmark trading strategies in the trading experiments.}

Obtaining high-quality well data can be challenging due to various issues such as drilling problems, improper logging processes, or operational issues with logging tools. Accurate and reliable imputation methods are essential to address missing or incomplete information in well log data, allowing better decision-making in the oil and gas industry. This study presents a novel well log data imputation method for the West Natuna Basin in Indonesia, using time-series deep learning models. Focusing on the “Kappa” well dataset with missing Vp log data, we trained long short-term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent unit (GRU), and bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) models using a window-based time step sequence of 10-timesteps intervals as input. The LSTM was observed as the best model, achieving a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of about 2.2% and an R-squared (R2) of about 94%. This result suggests that deep sequence model can be effectively used for missing data imputation in well log. Lastly, a petrophysical analysis further underlines the importance of these findings, offering deeper insights into reservoir properties, and value of our research in real-world exploration scenarios. The findings can aid in improving the accuracy and reliability of imputation in well log data, enabling better decision-making in the oil and gas industry.}

Finally, the expert consultation method is adopted to collect opinions from experts in the field of education and construct an evaluation index system for teaching games. And based on the evaluation index system of teaching games, evaluate students’ mathematical thinking ability before and after experiencing teaching games to verify the application effect of teaching games. The scenario based teaching game designed in this study has a certain effect on improving students’ mathematical thinking ability. Students’ mathematical thinking has significantly improved (P<0.05), and the teaching effect is the same for students of different genders (P>0.1). The improved sparrow search algorithm has a faster convergence rate than other algorithms, and tends to be stable when iteration is about 100 when solving the single peak benchmark function. When solving the multimodal benchmark test function, it tends to stabilize when iteration is around 20. The teaching game evaluation prediction price model based on the improved method shows a trend of first increasing and then decreasing with hidden units increasing. When the hidden unit is 16, the area index under model curve is the highest, around 0.962, and its prediction accuracy is relatively high.

Industrial data analytics methods play a central role in improving energy storage performance and efficiency, impacting the future of electrified transportation and renewable electricity generation. However, significant challenges hinder the large-scale deployment of batteries. Conventional methods rely on centralized collection and processing of fleet-level data, leading to database size issues and privacy concerns due to potential data breaches. To enable scalable deployment of battery management systems, this article proposes a federated battery diagnosis and prognosis model, which distributes the processing of battery standard current-voltage-time-usage data in a privacy-preserving manner. Instead of transferring the raw data, this approach communicates only the locally processed parameters, thus reducing communication load and preserving data confidentiality. The federated model offers a paradigm shift in battery health management through privacy-preserving distributed methods for battery data processing and lifetime prediction, ensuring the reliable and sustainable deployment of lithium-ion batteries in a rapidly evolving world.}

It is within this context that our study takes a focus on trust. While the concept of trust continues to grow in importance among AI researchers and practitioners, an investigation of trust/mistrust in algorithmic grading across multiple levels of analysis has so far been under-researched. In this paper, we argue the need for a model that encompasses the multi-layered nature of trust/mistrust in AI. Drawing on an embedded agency perspective, a model is devised that examines top-down and bottom-up forces that can influence trust/mistrust in algorithmic grading. We illustrate how the model can be applied by drawing on the case of the International Baccalaureate (IB) program in 2020, whereby an algorithm was used to determine student grades. This paper contributes to the AI-trust literature by providing a fresh theoretical lens based on institutional theory to investigate the dynamic and multi-faceted nature of trust/mistrust in algorithmic grading—an area that has seldom been explored, both theoretically and empirically. The study raises important implications for algorithmic design and awareness. Algorithms need to be designed in a transparent, fair, and ultimately a trustworthy manner. While an algorithm typically operates like a black box, whereby the underlying mechanisms are not apparent to those impacted by it, the purpose and an understanding of how the algorithm works should be communicated upfront and in a timely manner.}

However, the existing methods only extract the explicit semantic information that reveals the literal meaning of a question, and ignore the implicit knowledge information that highlights the knowledge intention. To this end, an innovative dual-channel model, the Semantic-Knowledge Mapping Network (S-KMN) is proposed to enrich the question representation from two perspectives, semantic and knowledge, simultaneously. It integrates semantic features learning and knowledge mapping network (KMN) to extract explicit semantic features and implicit knowledge features of questions,respectively. Designing KMN to extract implicit knowledge features is the focus of this study. First, the context-aware and sequence information of knowledge attribute words in the question text is integrated into the knowledge attribute graph to form the knowledge representation of each question. Second, learning a projection matrix, which maps the knowledge representation to the latent knowledge space based on the scene base vectors, and the weighted summations of these base vectors serve as knowledge features. To enrich the question representation, an attention mechanism is introduced to fuse explicit semantic features and implicit knowledge features, which realizes further cognitive processing on the basis of understanding semantics. The experimental results on 19,410 real-world physics quiz questions in 30 knowledge points demonstrate that the S-KMN outperforms the state-of-the-art text classification-based question annotation method. Comprehensive analysis and ablation studies validate the superiority of our model in selecting knowledge-specific features.}

However, considerable interactions between the student entity and the other two types of entities (i.e., questions and skills) in ITS have not been well utilized, which restricts the performance of these models. To this end, we propose HIN-KT, a novel heterogeneous information network (HIN)-based pre-processing model, to further enhance the performance of existing KT models. An HIN is first built to model student–question–skill interactions. Subsequently, HIN-KT employs the interaction information modeled by HIN to pre-train embeddings for questions and then adopts pre-trained question embeddings to enhance the performance of recent deep KT models. Experimental results over three public KT datasets demonstrate that large gains in knowledge tracing can be achieved when the proposed HIN-KT model is used to pre-train question embeddings for state-of-the-art deep KT models. In particular, the two state-of-the-art deep KT models, deep knowledge tracing (DKT) and convolutional knowledge tracing (CKT) successfully improved their performance by an average of 7.88% with the help of the HIN-KT model, which is significant progress made in the knowledge tracing domain.}

abstract = {Practically, a maintenance operation is performed on industrial equipment after scheduled planning that depends on the average useful life of this equipment (Mean Time Between Failures or Mean Time to Failure). Hence, in the industry, the use and the processing of data certainly improve productivity. But they induce a complexity of the industrial system caused by the different misconduct and measurements. This requires significant expenses on the safety, reliability, and availability of this type of machine. In this work, a new approach is proposed to determine the degradation indicators of a GE MS 5002B gas turbine installed on the Hassi R'Mel gas field in southern Algeria. The proposed approach is based primarily on Long Short-Term Memory LSTM networks, using in-depth learning of operating data. We are starting with the study of their reliability and their prognosis to validate and improve their performance, by optimizing their life cycle costs through good operating, repair, and maintenance planning. The objective is to remedy the problems mentioned by the processing of conventional data and predict their evolution and progression during the lifetime of the examined turbine. By combining actual reliability tests with predictions based on their failure rates to ensure good operating safety, and availability of the turbine system by controlling aging and degradation indices with satisfaction in environment and yield of this rotating machine.}

The dataset is collected from two international schools, a British curriculum, and an American Curriculum schools based in Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. Following the ethical approval from Liverpool John Moores University (19/CMS/001), the data is collected through gatekeepers. A permission letter was granted from the Ministry of Education and Knowledge in Abu Dhabi, UAE to provide access to the schools. The dataset is anonymised by eliminating sensitive and identifiable students’ information and prepared to be used for pattern analysis and prediction of student grading based on diverse educational backgrounds that might be useful for automated student levelling, i.e., at which level the student needs to be entered when moved from a different school with different international curriculum.}

abstract = {This paper develops a robust stochastic configuration network (RSCN) framework to cope with data modelling problems when the given samples contain noises or outliers. Technically, RSCNs are built by generalizing the objective function used in our original stochastic configuration networks with maximum correntropy criterion (MCC) induced losses (the proposed algorithm is termed as RSC-MCC). The half-quadratic (HQ) technique is employed to optimize the penalty weights for each training sample, aiming to weaken the impacts caused by the noisy data or outliers throughout the training session. Alternating optimization (AO) methodology is used to renew the RSCN model in company with updated penalty weights determined by HQ methods. The performance of RSC-MCC algorithm is compared with some existing methods, such as the probabilistic robust learning algorithm for neural networks with random weights (PRNNRW), RVFL networks, improved RVFL networks (Imp-RVFL), and our recent work RSCNs with kernel density estimation (RSC-KDE), on two synthetic function approximation examples, four benchmark datasets and one educational data modelling case study (for student learning performance prediction). The experimental results show that RSC-MCC performs more favourably in robust data analytics, and further indicate that our proposed RSCN framework (both RSC-KDE and RSC-MCC) has a good potential for real-world applications.}

abstract = {The article examines a number of ways in which the use of artificial intelligence technologies to predict the performance of individuals and to reach decisions concerning the entitlement of individuals to positive decisions impacts individuals and society. It analyses the effects using a social justice lens. Particular attention is paid to the experiences of individuals who have historically experienced disadvantage and discrimination. The article uses the university admissions process where the university utilises a fully automated decision-making process to evaluate the capability or suitability of the candidate as a case study. The article posits that the artificial intelligence decision-making process should be viewed as an institution that reconfigures the relationships between individuals, and between individuals and institutions. Artificial intelligence decision-making processes have institutional elements embedded within them that result in their operation disadvantaging groups who have historically experienced discrimination. Depending on the manner in which an artificial intelligence decision-making process is designed, it can produce solidarity or segregation between groups in society. There is a potential for the operation of artificial intelligence decision-making processes to fail to reflect the lived experiences of individuals and as a result to undermine the protection of human diversity. Some of these effects are linked to the creation of an ableist culture and to the resurrection of eugenics-type discourses. It is concluded that one of the contexts in which human beings should reach decisions is where the decision involves representing and evaluating the capabilities of an individual. The legislature should respond accordingly by identifying contexts in which it is mandatory to employ human decision-makers and by enacting the relevant legislation.}
