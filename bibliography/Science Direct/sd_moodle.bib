abstract = {A vast number of studies reported exciting innovations and practices in the field of Learning Analytics (LA). Whilst they provided substantial insights, most of these studies have been implemented in single-course or small-scale settings. There are only a few studies that are large-scale and institutional-wide adaptations of LA and have explored the stakeholders' perspectives (i.e., teachers, students, researchers, management) and involvement with LA. This study reports on one such large-scale and long-term implementation of Predictive Learning Analytics (PLA) spanning a period of 4 years at a distance learning university. OU Analyse (OUA) is the PLA system used in this study, providing predictive insights to teachers about students and their chance of passing a course. Over the last 4 years, OUA has been accessed by 1159 unique teachers and reached 23,180 students in 231 undergraduate online courses. The aim of this study is twofold: (a) to reflect on the macro-level of adoption by detailing usage, challenges, and factors facilitating adoption at an organisational level, and (b) to detail the micro-level of adoption, that is the teachers' perspectives about OUA. Amongst the factors shown to be critical to the scalable PLA implementation were: Faculty's engagement with OUA, teachers as “champions”, evidence generation and dissemination, digital literacy, and conceptions about teaching online.}

abstract = {Educators seek to develop accurate and timely prediction models to forecast student retention and attrition. Although prior studies have generated single point estimates to quantify predictive efficacy, much less education research has examined variability in student performance predictions using nonparametric bootstrap algorithms in data pipelines. In this study, bootstrapping was applied to examine performance variability among five data mining methods (DMMs) and four filter preprocessing feature selection techniques for forecasting course grades for 3225 students enrolled in an undergraduate biology class. While the median area under the curve (AUC) values obtained from bootstrapping were significantly lower than the AUC point estimates obtained without resampling, DMMs and feature selection techniques impacted variability in different ways. The ensemble technique elastic net regression (GLMNET) significantly outperformed all other DMMs and exhibited the least amount of variability in the AUC. However, all filter feature selection techniques significantly increased variability in student success predictions, compared to when this step was omitted from the data pipeline. We discuss the potential benefits and drawbacks of incorporating bootstrapping into prediction pipelines to track, monitor, and forecast classroom performance, as well as highlight the risks of only examining point estimates.}

The purpose of this article is to explore and highlight the crucial role these platforms play in optimizing the assessment process in higher education institutions. In the year 2020, the world of education has been challenged by the global pandemic of COVID-19, causing educational institutions to rapidly reconfigure teaching and assessment strategies. With the suspension of traditional courses, institutions have been forced to adopt distance teaching and assessment methods. In this context, the development and use of online learning platforms have become essential to ensure the continuity of the educational process. Focusing on universities, this article proposes to highlight the crucial importance of online educational platforms in optimizing students’ assessment. The goal is to develop a university platform that facilitates both the student evaluation process and effective communication between students and teachers. Thus, this article aims to explore in depth how online educational platforms can influence and improve the process of student assessment in universities. This paper brings to the fore the essential role that technology plays in educating future generations and preparing them for the challenges of a world in continuous transformation. We present our proposed platform that can be used to evaluate the students in automatically way.}

Drawing on self-regulated learning theory and attribution theory, we hypothesize that providing students with analytics on their own effort along with the effort and performance of relevant peers will help students attribute their performance to factors under their control and thus positively influence their subsequent behavior and performance. To test the effect of the analytics and verify the proposed mechanism, we conducted an experiment in an online undergraduate course in which students were randomly assigned to receive theoretically inert questions (control condition), attribution questions (active control condition), and the analytics with attribution questions (treatment condition). The intervention significantly increased effort attribution, reduced ability attribution, and improved subsequent effort for a subgroup of students who self-reported low performance, although there was no significant impact on their performance.}

Multi-level logistic regression models indicated that characteristics including gender, in-state residency, admission test scores, previous online course enrollment, and course size, among others, can influence student enrollment by course modality. Multi-way fixed effects linear regression models indicated that student grades were slightly lower in online courses compared to face-to-face courses. However, at-risk college student populations (low-income students, first-generation students, low-performing students) were not found to suffer additional course performance penalties of online course participation.}

Previous research uncovered a rich set of domain-specific and generic cognitive and metacognitive strategies students use when they learn to program. The processes that problem-solving experts demonstrate are very similar to those studied by self-regulated learning researchers. This study proposes Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) process types derived from the SRL phases indicators developed from log data captured from students' interaction with the instructional scaffold for programming assignments in LMS. The process types were defined from theoretical and pragmatic perspectives, with the aim to indicate concrete interventions for improving problemsolving skills. We have observed and quantified students' use of the SRL processes of distinct types in the series of five problem-solving assignments. We have also observed the progression of SRL processes used by each student in the assignments. Our modelling showed that students with domain knowledge at the same level achieve higher assignment marks when they demonstrate SRL processes at the higher level; importantly, students with the lowest programming skills benefit the most.}

A classification and regression tree (CART) analysis of instructor strategies revealed four instructor participation variables (open-ended discussion, grading, discussion setting, elaborated feedback) that impacted student course performance and nine that did not. Further, students in courses where instructors used open-ended discussion prompts and graded posts had higher average final course grades. An examination of how instructor discussion strategies influenced student participation found that subgroups of students with lower average final course grades tended to engage in less online speaking and listening, while also contributing more posts categorized as social interactions and fewer related to course content. Students in subgroups with higher average final course grades tended to engage in more online listening and contributed more posts coded as higher in knowledge construction.}

Guided by Winne and Hadwin's COPES model (1998), SRL was operationalized at a coarse level with students' online log data and course assessment scores representing their SRL operations and products of SRL in the course, respectively. Results of mixed ANOVAs and chi-square tests of independence showed that the LA-based feedback enhanced students' completion rate of online learning activities and their study regularity. The treatment group exhibited superior performance in the final examination compared to the comparison group, providing evidence of the positive impact of LA-based feedback on students' course performance.

We design two online review exercises, which are summative assessments with a formative aspect, for an introductory financial accounting subject and study the effect of these tasks on a group of business students enrolled in the course at an international joint venture university based in China. We find that the online review exercises increase student engagement. Students spent a significant amount of time preparing for the online review exercises both before making their initial attempt and between each attempt. Students undertook a variety of learning activities in completing the online review exercises and their understanding of the subject improved as a result of going through the process. Student performance in the midterm and final exams is positively related to their efforts in completing the online review exercises. The findings are of relevance to accounting educators in both the Western HEIs and traditional Chinese universities who are interested in enhancing the learning performance of Chinese business students.}

In this perspective, perceived usability of the online learning platforms that are currently being used is an important aspect, especially due to the absence of any physical classes. In this work Microsoft Teams is used as the reference platform for which the perceived usability is evaluated. For the evaluation purpose a dual strategy is followed by using the System Usability Scale (SUS), which is a Human Computer Interaction (HCI) based approach, and the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), which is an Information Systems (IS) based approach. Although both these instruments are popular in their respective domains, yet they have not been considered simultaneously in one work for the purpose of usability evaluation. By doing so, this work attempts to streamline and unify the process of usability evaluation. Results that are obtained from a large-scale survey of university students show the similarity and equivalency between the two methodologies, with the Perceived Ease of Use (PEOU) construct of TAM having greater similarity with SUS. Moreover, this work also considers the digital-divide aspect (mobile vs. web environment) that is prevalent particularly in developing countries like India, and whether it has any effect on the perceived usability. Results show that the consumption platform does not have any effect on the usability aspect.}

All courses are flipped hybrid courses, i.e., students work on online preparatory activities at their own pace before attending a set of interactive sessions organized on five consecutive days. Those sessions can be attended either onsite or remotely. During the academic year 2022/2023, 8 different courses were offered, and 185 students successfully completed the courses, with a success rate of 87.7% for the students taking at least one activity during the interactive sessions. Student behaviour and performance were monitored via the Learning Management System (LMS) used in all courses. This paper presents an analysis of various metrics from the LMS and demonstrates a high level of engagement of the students committed to the courses and a high success rate for those students.

To implement the framework of learning analytics, researchers have adopted machine learning methodologies to identify at-risk students at an early stage. In theory, machine learning is a mathematical algorithm that improves automation through experience. The experience is the data collected from online learning platforms, and in general, the data contain various features such as the number of times that a student accesses the learning material each week. Relevant studies have demonstrated extremely high accuracy in identifying at-risk students using identification models trained by machine learning. However, numerous details and data challenges have been overlooked in prior studies, calling into question the accuracy of past contributions. In this study, we focused on one type of data challenge: data imbalance. The data imbalance problems in education are usually the result of teachers’ grading policy. To highlight the seriousness of this issue, we collected data from 12 blended learning courses and summarized 3 types of grading policies: discrimination, stringency, and leniency. We then provided evidence that the leniency strategy causes the illusion of high accuracy of at-risk student identification. Finally, we verified a robust method to address the effectiveness of the leniency strategy, and using these results, we summarized the characteristics of students who tend to be misidentified by machine learning methodology.}

The aim of this study is to examine how neurocognitive data collected via functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) may be used to create predictive models of student outcomes with greater speed and accuracy when using a synthetic adaptive learning environment (SALEs). Specifically, this study examines the utility of using neurocognitive data to develop student response prediction on a science content test. Participants were recruited from schools located in the United States (n = 40). Participants in the study engaged in three conditions: no content, video and virtual reality. The lesson video and virtual reality lesson provides an explanation of deoxyribonucleic acid replication. Observed neurocognitive responses were collected during each condition and used to predict the success of student responses on an assessment. On average the predicative accuracy of this approach is 85% and occur within 300 ms. Predictive error rates are less than 15%. Results of this study provides evidence to support the use of neurocognitive data for adaption of digitally presented content and how machine learning approaches and artificial intelligence may be used to classify student data in real-time as students engage with content. Results also illustrate good accuracy and capture of moment-to- moment fluctuations of cognition in real-time. These findings may help the development of artificially intelligent tutors and improve student-based learning analytics.}

The sample included 6,174 students being taught by 93 teachers in 49 schools in the 2018–2019 academic year. Multilevel structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis revealed the relationship between SRL indicators and student achievement. We found a positive relationship between student SRL and student achievements. Specifically, three SRL indicators, “Watched Recommended Videos”, “Watched Videos” and “Answered Quizzes after Watching a Video”, were significantly associated with student achievement. We did not observe direct associations between teacher orchestration and student achievement, but we found an indirect association between teacher orchestration and student achievement via one SRL indicator, “Watched Recommended Videos”. The results show that a positive relationship between EOC scores and student reviewing incorrect questions increased as the use of instructional videos by the teacher increased. This study supports the critical role of SRL and indicates that teachers should have flexibility in adapting learning activities for online learning.}

abstract = {Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) are a type of Learning Management Systems (LMSs), but it seems that the influence of the instructor in these systems is minimal or simply lacking. These systems present the learning content and materials to all learners attending the course in the same way and fail to offer individualized instruction that recognizes the individual differences and needs of the learners. It is reported that such problems can be eliminated by making the new generation intelligent learning systems. However, there is still an ongoing search for making such systems intelligent and a conceptual discussion concerning them. Integrating an intelligent tutoring system (ITS) with learning analytics, this study seeks to design and present the framework of an ITS with open access that a) identifies the learning needs of learners through adaptive mastery testing and guides learners based on these needs, b) overcomes learning deficiencies, monitors learners' interactions with content through learning analytics and offers suggestions, c) supports learning with dynamic assessment processes and d) tests learners’ learning competencies. This article aims to explain the conceptual and system framework for the design of an adaptive, dynamic, intelligent tutoring system (SMIT), supported by learning analytics, which is a product of the project, which aims to integrate LMS and ITS, on the idea of how to make systems such as MOOCs smarter. In line with the findings obtained from the research, various suggestions were made for the design of smart Moocs.}

Many institutions are focused on improving the performance and the education quality; and this can be achieved by utilizing data mining techniques to analyze and predict students’ performance and to determine possible factors that may affect their final marks. To address this issue, this work starts by thoroughly exploring and analyzing two different datasets at two separate stages of course delivery (20% and 50% respectively) using multiple graphical, statistical, and quantitative techniques. The feature analysis provides insights into the nature of the different features considered and helps in the choice of the machine learning algorithms and their parameters. Furthermore, this work proposes a systematic approach based on Gini index and p-value to select a suitable ensemble learner from a combination of six potential machine learning algorithms. Experimental results show that the proposed ensemble models achieve high accuracy and low false positive rate at all stages for both datasets.}

Simultaneously, these studies emphasised the importance of the input data quality, its precise pre-processing and thoroughly selected features on final performance metrics of the applied classification algorithms. However, the stand-alone application of well-known classification algorithms still has performance limitations, which can be outperformed using ensembles of classifiers. Therefore, this paper aims to evaluate the overall contribution of the selected ensemble methods to the early prediction of students at risk of dropping out of learning courses. All phases of CRISP-DM methodology are described in this study to explain the complexity of the problem of the practical adoption of voting-based heterogeneous ensemble methods in the case of data obtained from the course of the university learning management system compared to traditional classification algorithms enhanced by ensemble learning with AdaBoost and XGBoost methods. As a result, the study confirmed that the features which characterise the students’ performance and their interactions in the course can be considered the most significant for the identification of the students at risk of dropping out. Moreover, in the case of advanced ensemble algorithms, the overall accuracy, recall, precision, and f1 score were improved by 2-4%. The proposed method has demonstrated exceptional performance. Finally, the paper summarises the findings and their implications for effective prediction.}

Leveraging the data-rich environment of the interactive learning management system proposed earlier, this study focuses on training a predictive model that forecasts student grades based on the comprehensive data collected during the teaching process. The proposed model capitalizes on the data obtained from students' engagement patterns, time spent on exercises, and progress tracking across learning activities. This study compared five different base classifiers— Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naïve Bayes (NB), and k-nearest Neighbor (k-NN), and an ensemble learning method Stacking Classifier —utilizing a dataset comprising 13 features. The research assesses the model's accuracy, reliability, and implications, contributing to the evolution of educational evaluation by introducing predictive assessment as a transformative tool. The results indicate that the Stacking Classifier accurately predicts students' grade ranges, surpassing individual base classification models by effectively combining their predictive capabilities. Integrating data-driven forecasting into the educational ecosystem can transform teaching methodologies and foster an informed, engaged, and empowered learning environment. This approach cultivates a proactive learning community by empowering students with real-time academic progress forecasts.

The integration of both unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques has demonstrated significant efficacy in predicting student performance. This paper explores the application of different machine learning methods in predicting student academic performance. Initially, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was utilised to reduce the dataset’s dimensionality, thereby improving its visualisation. Subsequently, K-Means clustering was employed to segregate students into distinct groups, reflective of their learning behaviors. Afterwards, the observed clusters were utilised for training classification models to address each student cluster individually. This approach was implemented in a case study involving an undergraduate science course at a North American University (NAU) and the Open University Learning Analytics Dataset (OULAD). Empirical findings indicate that the combined use of Feedforward Dense Network (FDN), Random Forest (RF), and Decision Tree (DT), specifically in their clustered forms, outperforms other classifiers in predicting student academic performance effectively.}

abstract = {The recent Covid-19 pandemic made universities rethink their traditional educational models, shifting, in some cases, to pure online or hybrid models. Hybrid settings usually involve onsite (i.e., in the classroom) and online (e.g., in a different classroom, at home) students simultaneously under the instruction of the same teacher. However, while these models provide more flexibility to students, hybridity poses additional challenges for the specific case of collaborative learning, likely increasing the teachers' orchestration load and potentially hampering fruitful interactions among learners. In order to gather empirical evidence on the impact of hybridity in collaborative learning, this paper reports a study conducted in a hybrid classroom where a Jigsaw collaborative pattern was implemented with the Engageli software. The study involved 2 teachers and 67 students enrolled in a computer science undergraduate course. Teachers' post-interviews, questionnaires and an epistemic network analysis (ENA) were used to produce study findings. Results show that teachers reported a medium-to-high orchestration load for implementing and setting up the collaborative activities in the hybrid classroom. Among the factors that contributed most to such load, teachers highlighted the creation and live management of groups and collaborative documents. Additionally, the ENA showed that teachers put much effort on monitoring group interactions and solving technical issues. Finally, we observed relevant differences on students' perceptions (e.g., satisfaction with the attention received by the teachers) based on the cohort sizes and on the students’ attendance modality (onsite vs. online).}

One hundred and eleven medical students were required to accomplish a diagnostic task in a computer-based learning environment. The metacognitive aspects of SRL were reported by students at different points during the task, and cognitive load was rated after students finished the task. We extracted SRL behaviors from system logfiles, and students' performance was measured as diagnostic accuracy, which indicated whether they achieved an accurate diagnosis. A two-step cluster analysis was conducted to identify students’ cognitive load patterns based on their perceived intrinsic, extraneous, and germane load. We found three cognitive load patterns: knowledge builders with a low-level intrinsic and extraneous load but high-level germane load, task-loaded learners with a high-level intrinsic and extraneous load but low-level germane load, and overloaded learners with high-level intrinsic, extraneous, and germane load. Moreover, we performed epistemic network analyses to compare the SRL behavior networks of the three clusters. The results showed that knowledge builders exhibited stronger connections associated with monitoring behaviors, while task-loaded and overloaded learners constructed more connections associated with help-seeking behaviors. The transitions between evaluation and solution elaboration behaviors were more frequent for knowledge builders than for the other clusters. Furthermore, knowledge builders reported higher scores in two types of metacognitive judgments: ease-of-learning and judgment-of-learning. Knowledge builders also achieved significantly higher diagnostic accuracy than task-loaded and overloaded students. These findings contributed to a more comprehensive understanding of how cognitive load interacts with SRL.}

By tracking learners’ digital traces and measuring learners’ performance, institutions can discern consequential learning trends via use of predictive models to enhance their instructional services. However, questions remain on how the proposed LA system is suitable, meaningful, and justifiable. In this concept paper, we examine generalizability and transparency of the internals of predictive models, alongside the ethical challenges in using learners’ data for building predictive capabilities. Model generalizability or transferability is hindered by inadequate feature representation, small and imbalanced datasets, concept drift, and contextually un-related domains. Additional challenges relate to trustworthiness and social acceptance of these models since algorithmic-driven models are difficult to interpret by themselves. Further, ethical dilemmas are faced in engaging with learners’ data while developing and deploying LA systems at an institutional level. We propose methodologies for apprehending these challenges by establishing efforts for managing transferability and transparency, and further assessing the ethical standing on justifiable use of the LA strategy. This study showcases underlying relationships that exist between constructs pertaining to learners’ data and the predictive model. We suggest the use of appropriate evaluation techniques and setting up research ethics protocols, since without proper controls in place, the model outcome would not be portable, transferable, trustworthy, or admissible as a responsible outcome. This concept paper has theoretical and practical implications for future inquiry in the burgeoning field of learning analytics.}

However, key questions remain: to what extent do these clickstream measures correspond to traditional self-reported measures about specific SRL constructs? Do these clickstream measures provide more information than existing self-reported measures in predicting course performance? This study used the clickstream data collected from a learning management system to measure two aspects of SRL: time management and effort regulation. We found that the clickstream measures were significantly associated with students' self-reported time management and effort regulation after the course. In addition, these clickstream measures significantly improved predictions of students' performance in the current and subsequent courses over predictions based on self-reported measures alone. These results provide evidence for the validity of the clickstream measures and guide the use of clickstream data to understand the process of SRL and identify students who might not be well served by taking classes online.}

Yet, even though these contemporary learning systems are useful educational platforms that meet students’ needs, there is still a low number of implemented systems designed to address the concerns and problems faced by many students.

Moreover, this work evaluates the use of this tool to support decision-making of actual advisers in two different higher education institutions (University A, University B), compared with more traditional procedures and tools. Results indicate that LADA enables expert advisers to evaluate significantly more scenarios (Median = 2), especially for high advising difficulty cases with students that failed many courses (MedianA=3,MedianB=2.5), in a not-significantly different amount of time. For inexperienced advisers, LADA is perceived as a valuable tool for more accurate and efficient decision-making, as they were able to make informed decisions in a similar amount of time compared to the experts.

We use the algorithm to analyze the social learning network manifest in the discussion format of a MOOC forum incorporating video lectures and problem assignments.

In the study, 280 students from 16 schools completed the LMS intervention. Through a series of t-tests, ANCOVAs, and multilevel models, we examined the effects of an LMS on students' entrepreneurial attributes and aspirations. The results indicated that the LMS enhances students' perceptions of entrepreneurial concepts. However, the effectiveness of the LMS was influenced by two key factors: the level of student engagement with the system and their previous entrepreneurial experiences. Higher engagement with the LMS and more extensive prior entrepreneurial experiences were found to significantly boost students' entrepreneurial attributes and aspirations. The outcomes indicate that by organizing content to minimize cognitive overload, the LMS facilitated the development of sophisticated cognitive schemas essential for entrepreneurial thinking.}

abstract = {Social learning analytics (SLA) is a promising approach for identifying students’ social learning processes in computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) environments. To identify the main characteristics of SLA, gaps and future opportunities for this emerging approach, we systematically identified and analyzed 36 SLA-related studies conducted between 2011 and 2020. We focus on SLA implementation and methodological characteristics, educational focus, and the studies’ theoretical perspectives. The results show the predominance of SLA in formal and fully online settings with social network analysis (SNA) a dominant analytical technique. Most SLA studies aimed to understand students’ learning processes and applied the social constructivist perspective as a lens to interpret students’ learning behaviors. However, (i) few studies involve teachers in developing SLA tools, and rarely share SLA visualizations with teachers to support teaching decisions; (ii) some SLA studies are atheoretical; and (iii) the number of SLA studies integrating more than one analytical approach remains limited. Moreover, (iv) few studies leveraged innovative network approaches (e.g., epistemic network analysis, multimodal network analysis), and (v) studies rarely focused on temporal patterns of students’ interactions to assess how students’ social and knowledge networks evolve over time. Based on the findings and the gaps identified, we present methodological, theoretical and practical recommendations for conducting research and creating tools that can advance the field of SLA.}

At present, the common e-learning platform only realizes the simple statistics and display function for the data, and does not do further in-depth calculation. The data observed by educators are still superficial learning phenomena, and they cannot see the learning rules behind the appearance. It is difficult to effectively guide students, change their learning routes and feedback teaching strategies. In view of this, the main characteristics of learning behavior deeply mined from learning activities and learning evaluation, and the important data feature items affect E-learning effect obtained. Three decision classification algorithms applied to establish prediction and evaluation model for students with learning behavior risk. The overall accuracy of model test is in line with the expectation. This provides a practical application modeling method for further implementation of personalized learning service.}

abstract = {In recent years, flipped classrooms have become increasingly popular in higher education environments. In tandem, there is an increasing interest in engagement analytics and educational data mining to identify how students directly engage with content and resources. The Flipped Learning Network (FLN) defines flipped learning as a pedagogical approach in which direct instruction moves from the group learning space to the individual learning space. The resulting group space is transformed into a dynamic, interactive learning environment where instructors guide students as they apply concepts and engage creatively with subject matter. To engage in flipped learning effectively, instructors incorporate four pillars into their educational practice (F-L-I-P): Flexible Environment, Learning Culture, Intentional Content and Professional Educator. This study focuses primarily on one pillar of F-L-I-P i.e., Intentional Content, provided to maximise classroom time, to better utilise teaching and learning methods for a more student-centred, active learning experience. This exploratory study uses log-file data generated by the Learning Management System (LMS) to identify patterns, usage, and engagement of 468 undergraduate students. Firstly, the study investigates what intentional content students effectively engage with, for learning. Secondly, it investigates usage frequency and specific intervals, with a view to identifying critical times in the semester where intentional content is perceived as essential by students. Thirdly, the study explores how intentional content supplements other elements of the FLIP environment. Preliminary findings indicate a discernible pattern of usage, and usage frequency of intentional content amongst students. Engagement is ad hoc; and in the main the behaviour is fragmented, inconsistent, and disjointed-overall students are not engaging effectively and consistently. Additionally, the distribution of intentional content engagement is skewed towards the start and end of semester, emphasising these intervals as critical points. Of note, more consistent behaviour is adopted at the beginning of the module, however students become less engaged with all content as the term progresses. Conversely, a change in student behaviour is observed as the term comes to a close, whereby more positive patterns emerge -perhaps attributable to pending examinations.}

Early warning systems can help by identifying both at-risk and high-performing students, allowing for timely interventions and enhanced learning opportunities. In our study, we used a year's worth of data from an information management school to build predictive models for two binary classification problems: identifying at-risk students and high-performing students. We employed traditional machine learning classifiers and long-short term memory units (LSTM), testing them at various stages of course completion. The best performance was achieved using all course data, with an AUC of 0.756 for at-risk students and 78.2% accuracy for high-performing students using Random Forest and Extremely Randomized Trees, respectively. We found that early prediction was possible as early as 25% course completion. Although LSTM showed inferior performance, it offered practical advantages for early prediction. Our findings suggest that static LMS logs can be reliable indicators of student success early in a course, and a course-agnostic time-dependent representation of the number of clicks can offer a worthwhile tradeoff between predictive performance and simplicity in implementation in some instances. These findings have important implications as they suggest the potential for automated early warning systems that can help educators identify students of interest and allocate resources where they are most needed. However, implementing these systems in real-time requires clear protocols and responsible policies. Further research should explore the generalizability of findings across different contexts and continuously evaluate their real-world effectiveness.}

abstract = {Educational data mining and learning analytics, although experiencing an upsurge in exploration and use, continue to elude precise definition; the two terms are often interchangeably used. This could be owing to the fact that the two fields exhibit common thematic elements. One avenue to provide clarity, uniformity, and consistency around the two fields, is to identify similarities and differences in topics between the two evolving fields. This paper conducted a topic modeling analysis of articles related to educational data mining and learning analytics to reveal thematic features of the two fields. Specifically, we employed structural topic modeling to identify the topics of the two fields from the abstracts. We apply structural topic modeling on N=192 articles for educational data mining and N=489 articles for learning analytics. We infer five-topic models for both educational data mining and learning analytics. We find that while there appears to be disciplinary differences in terms of research focus, there is little support for a clear distinction between the two disciplines, beyond their different lineage. The trend points to a convergence within the field of educational research on the applications of advanced statistical learning techniques to extract actionable insights from large data streams for optimizing teaching and learning. Both fields have converged on an increasing focus on student behaviors over the last five years.}

If students' academic performance is predicted course-wise, semester-wise and year-wise then it will be helpful for students to a great extent. In this research article, we generate twenty nine dataset with the help of students' result analysis. Datasets 1 to 9 is the datasets of students' result in first attempt while datasets 10 to 19 represent datasets of students after passing all courses of semesters and datasets 20 to 29 is overall dataset of students' result analysis. To predict the course-wise, semester-wise and year-wise performance of students, we developed a framework titled as ECSYAPPS (Educational Course Semester Year-wise Academic Performance Prediction System) based on classification techniques and designed algorithm for analyzing students' performance in education sector. This ECSYAPPS predicts the course-wise, semester-wise and year-wise grade of students. Fifteen classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression (LR), Naive Bayes (NB), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Linear Support Vector Classification (LSVC), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Gradient Boosting (GB), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), Bagging, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Light Gradient-Boosting Machine (LightGBM), Categorical Boosting (CatBoost), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier (SGDC) are selected and applied on 29 datasets and compared on basis of performance parameters such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). These fifteen classification algorithms are under ten classifiers such as Linear Model, Naive Bayes, Tree, Support Vector Machine, Nearest Neighbors, Ensemble, xgboost, lightgbm, Discriminant Analysis and catboost. If the accuracy of two more classification algorithms for a dataset is same then in that case Precision, Recall, F1-score and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) are compared for deciding the best classification algorithm for the dataset. In this way, best classification algorithm is selected for each of 29 datasets. It is found that classifiers xgboost works best for eleven datasets while ensemble techniques Gradient Boosting and AdaBoost work best for two datasets and six datasets respectively among 29 datasets. Other classification algorithms such as Decision Tree, LightGBM, LDA, and KNN are noted to be best classification algorithm for two, four, three, and two datasets respectively. This framework is tested on new eight datasets related to students' result two methods such as K-Fold Cross-validation and Train-Validation-Test method. The results of this framework on new datasets shows that accuracy obtained on test dataset or validation dataset as compared to the accuracy obtained on old dataset is less than 6%. This framework will be helpful for students as well instructor. For students, it will help them to improve the performance of difficult courses from students'point of view in the examination while faculty can use this framework to improve pedagogical practices.}

Student readiness and capability regarding self-regulated learning (SRL), the activity logs in the learning management system, and academic achievement were collected to investigate behavioral sequences of different typologies of learning self-regulation. Seventeen students who took OCI in the 2019 school year were recruited for the study. Through learning analytics for the 3965 behavioral codes, the study generated three key results. First, hierarchical cluster analysis classified two typologies of self-regulated online learners: High self-regulated learners (H-SRLs) and low self-regulated learners (L-SRLs). Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test further revealed a higher academic achievement in H-SRLs than that of the L-SRLs. Second, lag sequential analysis portrayed different behavioral sequences in the performance control phrase of SRL. H-SRLs tended to leverage proper learning skills like practice immediately after receiving assistance whereas L-SRLs exit immediately without taking further actions after learning new materials, revisited the syllabus, and checked course grades. Qualitative interviews further confirmed the relationship between different strategies used in the phase and the academic performance. L-SRLs were more likely to adopt passive learning strategies and even mismatched goals and strategies during online learning, while H-SRLs appeared otherwise. To support successful online learning experiences, the researchers suggest integrating workshops and resources into the online learning orientation that focus on the performance control of SRL. Moreover, AIED platform features also may support L-SRLs in performing proper learning strategies.}

Several motivational variables are analyzed to determine their effect on student performance. We use a machine-learning classifier to compare two approaches: 1) The benchmark study, which uses data from the same academic year for both training and testing; and 2) a prospective study, which focuses on extrapolating a model trained on the previous fall semester to predict outcomes for the upcoming fall semester. We categorize the motivational variables, including time management and event-occurrence frequency. The window-expansion strategy is adopted to enhance performance through periodic evaluation to facilitate timely intervention. Consequently, the prospective approach is consistent with the benchmark results, thus demonstrating its generalizability across academic years and student populations. This approach is promising for identifying at-risk students in the BL course early. The Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) method emphasizes the importance of time-management variables, particularly study in time, for identifying at-risk students. This study enhances our understanding of early detection methods for at-risk students. By analyzing time-related behaviors, we establish a robust foundation for data-driven decisions to improve future BL implementations as well as support motivation and self-regulated learning practices.}

We modeled how changes in student motivation and self-regulated learning (SRL) were related to what occurred during 1-on-1 meetings with academic advisors during which students had the potential to view representations of their achievement embedded within an Early Warning System (EWS) that visually represented aspects of their academic performance referenced with course averages. Constructs associated with SRL were moderated by advisor-advisee meetings. Results indicated that advisors' use of EWS while they met with students was negatively associated with the rate of decrease of students' reporting of using memorizing strategies but positively related when students' performance was compared to that of their peers. We discuss the moderating effects of students’ exposure to visualizations of academic performance on their SRL strategies and academic motivation. This study points to the importance of monitoring the effects of information presented via EWS on motivation and SRL.}

Many researchers interested in these areas may wonder why there are two different communities, whether they are the same concept or not, and the differences between them, which is key information for designing their research and publication strategies. To address this, we conducted a systematic review of academic papers about the differences between LA and EDM following the Preferred Reporting Method for Systematic Reviews (PRISMA) guidelines. We selected 10 research works and identified 11 differences. Our conclusions are that, although both use the same data and share similar goals and interests, EDM and LA are different research communities with different origins and focuses, with their respective conferences and journals. However, there is active collaboration between the two communities and their members often tend to publish in both fields’ conferences and journals. Additionally, none of the differences are apparently large enough to conclude that LA and EDM follow different paths for improving the teaching-learning process, but rather the opposite. Following a common future line, it seems that the two “sister” communities are working together with the same perspective, along with some “cousin” communities such as AIED (Artificial Intelligence in Education), L@S (Learning at Scale), Learning Science (LS), etc. in the same area that could be called Educational Data Science (EDS). We propose using the term EDS to integrate both LA and EDM with all these related communities.}

Interpretability makes it easy for the stakeholders to understand the working of these models and adaptability makes it easy to use the same model for multiple cohorts and courses in educational institutions. Recently, some models in learning analytics are constructed with the consideration of interpretability but their interpretability is not quantified. However, adaptability is not specifically considered in this domain. This paper presents a new framework based on hybrid statistical fuzzy theory to overcome these limitations. It also provides explainability in the form of rules describing the reasoning behind a particular output. The paper also discusses the system evaluation on a benchmark dataset showing promising results. The measure of explainability, fuzzy index, shows that the model is highly interpretable. This system achieves more than 82% recall in both the classification and the context adaptation stages.}

abstract = {In 2022, the numerical methods course taught at the Technion's Faculty of Chemical Engineering was transformed to hybrid-flipped format based on seven years of successful experience. This course involves three phases each week: (1) online pre-class preparation by students, (2) face-to-face class meeting with the instructor to introduce open-ended problem solving, and (3) an online active tutorial, where students solve problems for themselves. This paper describes the course learning objectives, content and format, data on students’ engagement and perceptions, learning analytics tools used, and the summative outcomes assessment, as brought by the final exam results. The main conclusions are: (a) High-engaging students indicated that their confidence in mastery significantly improves with each phase, with the low-engagers indicating no significant improvement, and (b) High-engagers significantly outperformed low-engagers in learning outcomes: 86% of the students scoring over 90 were high-engagers, and 83% of the students who failed the exam were low-engagers.}

In this paper, we propose a hyper-model of Convolutional Neural Networks and Long Short-Term Memory, called CONV-LSTM, in order to automatically extract features from MOOCs raw data and predict whether each student will drop out or complete courses. We consider class imbalance problem, which means that models will be biased to yield good results on the majority of class examples and poor results on the minority of class examples. In that case, model prediction is inaccurate, which means that the false negative rate is high. To reinforce better prediction performance, a cost-sensitive technique is used in the loss function, which considers the various misclassification costs for false negatives and false positives. The proposed model shows a better performance when compared to baseline methods.}

Building smart learning environments supported by e-learning platforms is an important area of research. The rapid and continuous development of technology that has brought new learning skills for students forces the educational system to enter into a new era. This change is further justified by some unprecedented events that force students to learn remotely. QLearn is an e-learning platform developed as a web based application which provides quizzes for students enrolled at Advanced Programming Methods course from Babeş Bolyai University (Romania) as part of their formative and summative assessment. The existing set of quizzes has been proposed by students throughout the last three iterations of the course in a collaborative manner with course instructor, and this data set is expanding continuously with every new generation of students. QLearn is a smart learning environment offering the students valuable feedback and a good preparation for the exam. Some metrics that quantify the coverage rate of the course syllabus attained by students or their understanding level of knowledge are provided by QLearn. The Artificial Intelligent component of QLearn application uses these measures to make predictions for students’ outcomes at the exam, to find out which topics need to be practised more and to recommend learning plans according to students’ individual needs. The contribution of the paper is therefore twofold. Firstly, we propose a new learning design, based on students’ involvement in a collaborative manner. The second contribution of the paper is QLearn, a software application that provides support (implementation) for the proposed learning process design. Not only does QLearn platform provide a smart learning environment for students, but it also ensures the knowledge transfer from instructors to students in an efficient and effective way.}

Nevertheless, only a few studies have investigated the behavioral patterns of high-scoring (HS) and low-scoring (LS) students to facilitate predictions during peer assessment (PA). Therefore, we performed learning analytics to explore the behavioral patterns of HS and LS students in 52 university students from affective, cognitive, and metacognitive perspectives as these students engage in online PAs. The results indicated that on the affective dimension, HS students tended to exhibit negative affection while LS students tended to display positive affection. On the cognitive dimension, HS students demonstrated more intricate transformations compared to the LS students. Regarding the metacognitive dimension, LS students more likely reflected upon and accepted the reviews provided by others than the HS. Additionally, the findings also revealed that HS students were supported by focused social networks and overall stable activity engagement, whereas the LS students were less engaged at the beginning of the activity but had evolving social networks and were more engaged in the later stages of the activity. These findings offer valuable insights for educators in effectively predicting student performance based on behavioral patterns while providing new perspectives to support instructional decision-making processes.}

Therefore, this research examines the development and evaluation of ontology-based recommender systems. The study also discusses technical ontology use and the recommendation process. We identified multidisciplinary ontology-based recommender systems in 28 journal articles. These systems combined ontology with artificial intelligence, computing technology, education, education psychology, and social sciences. Student models and learning objects remain the primary ontology use, followed by feedback, assessments, and context data. Currently, the most popular recommendation item is the learning object, but learning path, feedback, and learning device could be the future considerations. This recommendation process is reciprocal and can be initiated either by the system or students. Standard ontology languages are commonly used, but standards for student profiles and learning object metadata are rarely adopted. Moreover, ontology-based recommender systems seldom use the methodology of building ontologies and hardly use other ontology methodologies. Similarly, none of the primary studies described ontology evaluation methodologies, but the systems are evaluated by nonreal students, algorithmic performance tests, statistics, questionnaires, and qualitative observations. In conclusion, the findings support the implementation of ontology methodologies and the integration of ontology-based recommendations into existing learning technologies. The study also promotes the use of recommender systems in social science and humanities courses, non-higher education, and open learning environments.}

While the initial work on predictive modelling was focused on the development of general predictive models, portable across different learning settings, later studies demonstrated the drawbacks of not considering the specificities of course design and disciplinary context. This study builds on the methods and findings of related earlier studies to further explore factors predictive of learners' academic success in blended learning. In doing so, it differentiates itself by (i) relying on a larger and homogeneous course sample (15 courses, 50 course offerings in total), and (ii) considering both internal and external conditions as factors affecting the learning process. We apply mixed effect linear regression models, to examine: i) to what extent indicators of students' online learning behaviour can explain the variability in the final grades, and ii) to what extent that variability is attributable to the course and students' internal conditions, not captured by the logged data. Having examined different types of behaviour indicators (e.g., indicators of the overall activity level, those indicative of regularity of study, etc), we found little difference, if any, in their predictive power. Our results further indicate that a low proportion of variance is explained by the behaviour-based indicators, while a significant portion of variability stems from the learners' internal conditions. Hence, when variability in external conditions is largely controlled for (the same institution, discipline, and nominal pedagogical model), students’ internal state is the key predictor of their course performance.}

While their value over traditional practices has been identified, it is possible to implement a flipped classroom in many ways. Therefore, research needs to consider the distinct ways flipped classrooms are structured to identify their relative effectiveness. The usefulness of flipped classrooms is reduced when students’ procrastination in the pre-class phase, resulting in a lack of student engagement with online resources. This paper uses a cluster analysis of log-file data from three cohorts of a flipped classroom module, involving 169 undergraduate business students, to identify their learning strategies. It considers when students first begin to access online material and relates this to the timing of their classes and assessments. Two distinct learning strategies were identified. Prepared students accessed online resources as expected in advance of flipped classes. Assessment-focused students used the available resources after class to prepare for impending assessments. Prepared students performed significantly better than those that were assessment focused. In addition, there was more engagement with video-based material over text-based resources and also more engagement when assessments were weekly and low-stakes rather than terminal and higher-stakes. Concsequently, the way in which flipped classrooms are structured can reduce the level of student procrastination present and improve the effectiveness of this method.}

Feedback provides insights into the assistance of learners in terms of achieving learning goals and improving self-regulated skills. In online courses, feedback becomes even more critical since instructors and students are separated geographically and physically. In this context, feedback allows the instructor to customize learning content according to the students' needs. However, giving feedback is a challenging task for instructors, especially in contexts of large cohorts. As a result, several automatic feedback systems have been proposed to reduce the workload on the part of the instructor. Although these systems have started gaining research attention, there have been limited studies that systematically analyze the progress achieved so far as reported in the literature. Thus, this article presents a systematic literature review on automatic feedback generation in learning management systems. The main findings of this review are: (1) 65.07% of the studies demonstrate that automatic feedback increases student performance in activities; (2) 46.03% of the studies demonstrated that there is no evidence that automatic feedback eases instructors’ workload; (3) 82.53% of the studies showed that there is no evidence that manual feedback is more efficient than automatic feedback; and (4) the main method used for automatic feedback provision is the comparison with a desired answer in some subject (such as logic circuits or programming).}

We compared the feedback generated by GPT models (namely GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) with the feedback provided by human instructors in terms of readability, effectiveness (content containing effective feedback components), and reliability (correct assessment on student performance). Results showed that (1) both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 were able to generate more readable feedback with greater consistency than human instructors, (2) GPT-4 outperformed GPT-3.5 and human instructors in providing feedback containing information about effective feedback dimensions, including feeding-up, feeding-forward, process level, and self-regulation level, and (3) GPT-4 demonstrated higher reliability of feedback compared to GPT-3.5.

This study explores collaborative technology's effectiveness in facilitating learning in a hybrid (synchronous face-to-face and asynchronous virtual) context. In particular, the study explores the critical role of students' feeling-at-ease, including its drivers and impact on their perception of the technology.
Design/methodology/approach
The study included a classroom intervention in which a collaborative technology, i.e. VoiceThread, was implemented in a hybrid learning context. Online surveys, which included quantitative and qualitative components, were administered at the start and end of the semester to capture student perceptions and experiences with the technology.
Findings
Students who felt more at ease assessed the collaborative technology more positively. While extraversion was marginally associated with initial feeling at ease, technology anxiety was not. When using the technology to post content, students who felt more at ease preferred using audio or video over text. Students' perception of the importance of technology in facilitating their learning was a key mediator in the relationship between feeling less at ease and future intention to use the collaborative technology.
Originality/value

abstract = {In this study, we analyze the learning behavior of 24,000 students in a fully asynchronous subscription-based MOOC platform using hidden Markov models (HMMs) to examine the relationship between learning motivation and student drop-out behavior. In contrast to previous findings, our results reveal that student drop-out is not necessarily correlated with low motivation, as students may drop out despite being highly motivated at the end of their learning journey. To design more effective student retention campaigns, educational decision-makers must consider the motivation level and target potential drop-outs with a low state of motivation. More specifically, our findings emphasize the need for early intervention to prevent students from dropping out, as it becomes challenging to stimulate motivation once it reaches its lowest state. By adopting our proposed methodology, decision-makers can gain a better understanding of the student drop-out process and make more informed student retention interventions.}

By accurately identifying student eligibility for specific courses at the outset, a multitude of challenges, such as dropouts and poor performance, can be effectively mitigated or even prevented. This paper presents a Decision Support System (DSS) that leverages a hybrid data mining model to analyze educational data and unveil concealed patterns and rules. The DSS aims to support decision-makers in enhancing the operational effectiveness of academic institutions by enabling accurate determination of student eligibility for specific courses. To ensure robust analysis, diverse supervised algorithms were implemented, comparative evaluations were conducted, and association rule and unsupervised algorithms were employed to extract hidden patterns. In a case study involving graduates pursuing Master's degrees in Iran, the hybrid model effectively identifies Bachelor's degree majors that exhibit higher likelihoods of success in the targeted course and uncovers additional factors that significantly impact academic performance. The research outcomes highlight the considerable potential of the hybrid model in facilitating informed scholarship decisions and fostering overall institutional efficiency. Furthermore, the proposed DSS could be deployed with various educational datasets, potentially empowering decision-makers with valuable insights to distinguish between successful and unsuccessful students early in the course. This could contribute to optimizing educational outcomes and informing evidence-based policy-making.}

Despite a shift towards human-centred design in recent LA and AIED research, there remain gaps in our understanding of the importance of human control, safety, reliability, and trustworthiness in the design and implementation of these systems. We conducted a systematic literature review to explore these concerns and gaps. We analysed 108 papers to provide insights about i) the current state of human-centred LA/AIED research; ii) the extent to which educational stakeholders have contributed to the design process of human-centred LA/AIED systems; iii) the current balance between human control and computer automation of such systems; and iv) the extent to which safety, reliability and trustworthiness have been considered in the literature. Results indicate some consideration of human control in LA/AIED system design, but limited end-user involvement in actual design. Based on these findings, we recommend: 1) carefully balancing stakeholders' involvement in designing and deploying LA/AIED systems throughout all design phases 2) actively involving target end-users, especially students, to delineate the balance between human control and automation, and 3) exploring safety, reliability, and trustworthiness as principles in future human-centred LA/AIED systems.}

This paper describes the effect of the FT methodology on the students' academic performance when it was applied to the laboratory practice in two subjects, Physics and Electricity, of a technical degree. The laboratory and final grades of these subjects were compared in four consecutive years. The characteristics of all four years were quite similar, except that the traditional teaching method (TM) was used in two, while FT was applied in the other two. The statistical analysis shows that the academic results of the students were better in both subjects under FT than those obtained using TM, and that the difference was statistically significant.}

In many e-learning environments, students typically complete learning assignments outside of school hours with little or no instructor support, which requires students to be highly self-regulated. The current study used trace data from a Moodle platform to examine both the temporal pattern of students' SRL behaviors and changes in high- and low-performing students' SRL behaviors following a formative in-course exam. This study employed repeated-measures ANOVA, multivariate ANOVA, Fuzzy miner, and pMineR on 122,167 event logs from 527 undergraduate students. Findings revealed that students engaged in a loosely sequenced recursive SRL cycle. Following the formative assessment, each group made different adjustments to their SRL processes. High-performing students exhibited more SRL behaviors and developed more structured and interconnected SRL patterns. Low-performing students displayed a smaller increase in SRL behaviors while maintaining their established SRL patterns. Findings from this study could provide a more in-depth theoretical understanding of the nature of SRL cycles. Furthermore, students’ adjustment of SRL patterns in response to assessment may be informative for practitioners to assist students in enhancing their SRL through formative feedback.}

In this study, we developed an integrated model to classify learners based on their learning activity clicks by combining machine learning algorithms like K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) and Logistic regression (LR) with semantic association, which is used to help us map learning activity with VAK learning style. This enables us to classify learners, determine their preferred methods of learning, and offer the most suitable; as a result, we were able to group pupils according to their learning styles and provide the best evaluation technique or strategies. To assess the effectiveness of the suggested model, several tests were executed on the actual dataset (Open University Learning Analytics Dataset, or OULAD). According to studies, using a Random Forest algorithm, the suggested model can predict which evaluation strategy or strategies will be most effective for each student and can classify individuals with the highest degree of accuracy—98%.}

Aiming at achieving high interpretability and generalizability, this study reviews past research, defines a new categorization scheme for interactions in LMS and investigates the relationships between clickstream data of students’ activity and course performance, measured as final grade. The results of the multiple regression analysis of Moodle log data collected from three courses of diverse nature using various classifications of interactions suggest that the new categorization, the CILC (Classification of Interactions based on the Learning Cycle), improves the explanatory power when compared to previous classifications. The analysis suggests that the predictive ability of the models could depend on the delivery mode, with predictions improving as the delivery mode transitions from face-to-face learning to online learning. This finding highlights the need for context-specific considerations about the learning process. Compared to previous research, the analysis also reveals nuances that suggest that the relationships may depend on the instructional design. Finally, the findings also seem to support the notion that increased data quantity and quality may improve predictive models. In summary, the study contributes with valuable insights into the interplay between LMS interactions, course delivery mode, instructional design, and academic performance, and advocates for a balanced exploration of white-box and black-box modeling approaches in learning analytics research.}

A knowledge of the factors that affect student learning could help universities and study centres adjust their curricula and teaching methods to the needs of their students. One of the first measures employed by teaching institutions was to create Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs). This type of environment makes it possible to attract a larger number of students because it enables them to study from wherever they are in the world, meaning that the student’s location is no longer a constraint. Moreover, VLEs facilitate access to teaching resources, they make it easier to monitor the activity of the teaching staff and of the interactions between students and teachers. Thus, online environments make it possible to assess the factors that cause the students’ academic performance to increase or decrease. To understand the factors that influence the university learning process, this paper applies a series of automatic learning techniques to a public dataset, including tree-based models and different types of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Having applied these techniques to the dataset, the number of times students have accessed the resources made available on VLE platforms has been identified as a key factor affecting student performance. This factor has been analysed by conducting a real case study which has involved 120 students doing a masters degree over a VLE platform. Concretely, the case study participants were masters degree students in areas related to computer engineering at the University of Salamanca.}

However, little is known about the typology of dashboard feedback relevant for different learning goals, learners and teachers. While most dashboards and the feedback that they give are based only on learner performance indicators, research shows that effective feedback needs also to be grounded in the regulatory mechanisms underlying learning processes and an awareness of the learner's learning goals. The design artefact presented in this article uses a conceptual model that visualizes the relationships between dashboard design and the learning sciences to provide cognitive and behavioral process-oriented feedback to learners and teachers to support regulation of learning. A practical case example is given that demonstrates how the ideas presented in the paper can be deployed in the context of a learning dashboard. The case example uses several analytics/visualization techniques based on empirical evidence from earlier research that successfully tested these techniques in various learning contexts.}

However, earlier studies have found problems with interpreting LMS log data to understand student approaches to learning within the context of a learning design. This study investigates whether it is possible to use LMS log data as a proxy to understand students' learning strategies over different periods of time in the flipped-classroom context. A total of 135 sophomores from two classes of a flipped programming course participated in this study. Exploratory factor analysis is first conducted on the log data to synthesize second-order predictors based on the total-effort model. Then, we investigate the extent to which these second-order predictors relate to students' learning outcomes over time. Four types of learning outcomes are considered, including a quiz, a midterm exam, a final exam and the final grade. For each type of learning outcome, multiple linear regression is used to construct a weekly prediction model from these predictors. Adjusted R-squared and RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) are the metrics used to compare the models. The results show that consistent second-order predictors can be derived from log data, implying that students' clicking events in LMS could manifest students' learning strategies understandable in the design context of a flipped classroom. Furthermore, compared with the first-order models, most of the models constructed using the second-order predictors have higher predictive performance, although with lower data fitness. In addition, the predictive performance of the models with MSLQ (Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire) indicators and past assessment data are also examined. It is found that MSQL variables have a positive but short-termed effect on the models’ predictive ability, while past assessment data greatly improve the models of all types of learning outcomes. Theoretical contributions and implications of the proposed approach for practice, research and future research are discussed.}

We include two separate indicators of learner-content interaction (the amount of time spent and number of completed adaptive assignments) in our analysis. Results indicate that student performance is enhanced by the number of completed adaptive assignments, which captures learner-content interaction and adaptive learning. However, the amount of time spent studying was negatively associated with performance. This surprising result comes as a novel contribution, which extends our knowledge of how adaptive learning technology can be potentially used to drive learner-content interaction and student performance. Pedagogically, our findings suggest the need for more intentional design and personalisation of learning activities to enhance student-content interaction and subsequent performance.}

In this study, we harnessed data from the ‘Offee’ assessment platform based in Mumbai, India, spanning from September 2020 to October 2022. This dataset allows us to analyze the real impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on examinations. To tackle the challenges posed by high-dimensional data, we employed feature selection techniques to retain only the most significant features for predicting student performance. Specifically, we assessed the effectiveness of two decision tree-based methods, J48 classifier and Random Forest, in conjunction with the ranker search method using wrapper subset evaluation. The resulting feature set was then utilized to train and test a Support Vector Machine model for predicting student performance. Our findings reveal that both J48 and Random Forest feature selection methods yield impressive precision accuracy rates for student performance prediction, achieving 93.14% and 86.24%, respectively. In contrast, using the dataset without feature selection resulted in lower precision accuracy, standing at 79.9%, and consumed more time during model training and development. In summary, this study underscores the significance of feature selection in enhancing the accuracy of student performance prediction compared to utilizing the dataset without such feature curation.}

Assessment of these skills requires process-based observations and evaluation, as the output-based methods have been found to be insufficient. Virtual learning environments offer a wealth of data on the process, which makes them good candidates for process-based evaluation, but the existing assessment methods in these environments have shortcomings, such as reliance on large data sets, inability to offer specific feedback on actions, and the lack of consideration for how actions are integrated into bigger tasks. Demonstrating and confirming the ability of three-dimensional virtual learning environments to work with process metrics for assessment, we propose and evaluate the use of motifs as an assessment tool. Motifs are short and meaningful combination of metrics. Combining time-ordered motifs with a similarity analysis between expert and learner data, our proposed approach can potentially offer feedback on specific actions that the learner takes, as opposed to single output-based feedback. It can do so without the use of large training datasets due to reliance on expert data and similarity analysis. Through a user study, we found out that such a motif-based approach can be effective in the assessment of higher-order thinking skills while addressing the identified shortcomings of previous work. We also address the limited research on similarity-based analysis methods, compare their effectiveness, and show that utilizing different similarity measures for different tasks may be a more effective approach. Our proposed method facilitates and encourages the involvement of instructors and course designers through the definition of motifs and expert problem-solving paths.}

Student early alert systems are part of formal, proactive, early intervention communication initiatives that institutions have put into place to help with the timely identification and intervention (alert) of at-risk students. The significance of student early alert systems is that support could be offered to high-risk students while they are still enrolled in the unit and able to influence their success/failure before the unit completes. Delivering timely interventions to students via a student early alert system typically requires teaching staff to identify at-risk students, and act upon that information in a way that would encourage students to change their behaviours. However, little is understood regarding teachers’ needs and attitudes towards the use of such a system. In the context of a prototype early alert system, this article reports the practices and opinions of a range of teaching staff across all faculties within an institution. The article sheds light on how teachers measure student performance and engagement in their units, and the perceived benefits and barriers of using the early alert system to identify and manage at-risk students.}

Results support the view that this project applying a COIL approach may help students to consolidate their master's degree training and gain self-confidence when applying their knowledge in a real experience. The combination of these two approaches, ICLHE and COIL, seem to benefit students since they have used everything learnt and feel that the master's degree contents are widely implemented in the VBP project.

abstract = {In recent days, learners faced difficulties learning programming courses. This research study will help the learners learn complex concepts quickly with different activities like flipped classrooms, online quizzes, learning by doing, and a virtual laboratory. This research is carried out to address the difficulties of learners and cover all the domains of learning, including knowledge, Skill, and Attitude. The fuzzy logic method has recently been applied in education to overcome these restrictions. While employing the fuzzy logic approach to evaluate student achievement, qualifications are assessed qualitatively rather than quantitatively. This research study applies Fuzzy Logic in the first stage, Factor Analysis (FA), and Machine Learning (ML) techniques in the second stage to discover essential factors associated with the effective use of Active Learning Strategies (ALS) in the Learning Management System (LMS) of information technology course learners. Fuzzy logic and neural network topology can be coupled using ANFIS, an adaptable network. FA is performed to find the critical factors for successful learners. The study compares the performance of five supervised machine learning algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Discriminant Analysis, and Support Vector Machine. These classifiers are evaluated to determine their suitability and model fit in the context of the research. In this study, real-time data is collected from B.Tech Information Technology learners. The following prediction models achieved high accuracy before FA analysis: Naive Bayes (90 %), Support Vector Machine (89 %), Discriminant Analysis (88 %), Decision Tree (86 %), and K-Nearest Neighbors (82 %). Naive Bayes gives the best accuracy, with 90 %. Following factor analysis (FA), the accuracy achieved by various classifiers is as follows: Naive Bayes - 92 %, K-Nearest Neighbors - 92 %, Support Vector Machine - 90 %, Discriminant Analysis - 89 %, and Decision Tree - 88 %. Among these, Naive Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbors exhibit the highest accuracy of 92 %.}

However, instructors may not know students' preparedness and motivation for each class. This study intended to examine the underlying mechanism between students' before-class video-viewing engagement and performance. We investigated learners' motivation (i.e., autonomous and controlled motivation) based on self-determination theory and controlled for their gender, age, and prior performance. An integrated temporal model was built under the dynamic structural equation modeling framework. Participants were 118 Taiwanese graduate students (78 females and 40 males) with a mean age of 26.14 years old. Study findings showed that students engage with the video content in a consistent viewing pattern, which has a significant relationship with their motivation and academic performance from week to week. The frequency of skipping backward was negatively associated with controlled motivation, while the frequency of pauses was positively associated with autonomous and controlled motivation. A high frequency of skipping forward predicted lower learning performance. Besides, a higher ratio of skipping backward predicted higher controlled motivation. Male students, older students, and students with higher prior performance exhibited higher autonomous motivation, which was related to better learning performance. Understanding these relationships can help educators and instructional designers develop more effective strategies for fostering students’ preparedness, engagement and success in active learning contexts. The study findings were discussed considering theoretical advancement and practical implications for enhancing personalized and active learning in higher education to achieve educational equity.}

The study aimed to characterize learners according to their learning patterns and to identify indicators that predict students' success in an online environment. Specifically, we focused on the role of a central factor affecting success in online courses: self-regulated learning and learner engagement. To this end, we used a mixed methods approach that combines semi-structured interviews and statistical analysis. We applied two logistic regression models and a decision tree algorithm and found two parameters that can predict completion of the course: the submission status of an optional assignment and the students' cumulative video opening pattern (SCOP). Recommendations for institutions and lecturers regarding the benefits of implementing these models to identify self-regulated learning patterns in online courses and to design future effective interventions are discussed. Regarding students, we emphasize the importance of time management and how choices they make with respect to their learning process affect their potential for success.}

In strategies like the flipped classroom, students need to follow a specific learning pathway to complete certain activities in the LMS before class. This includes watching videos and completing readings and quizzes, to prepare for hands-on exercises during classroom time. Consistent student engagement with this approach is vital for success – but in large subjects with hundreds of enrolments, monitoring that engagement is a complex task. Using the data collected in an LMS, this paper presents an approach for detecting significant changes in student engagement in hybrid learning environments. The approach uses Process Mining (PM), a family of tools and techniques to analyze data through a process lens, to compare students' learning pathways between pairs of learning windows (e.g., weeks in a semester). Using a real-life event log containing more than 26,000 interactions of 194 students over a full semester, the findings demonstrate the approach's ability to detect changes in student engagement over time. These insights can be used by educators to refine their instructional design, deliver targeted interventions, and ultimately improve the overall effectiveness of hybrid learning.}

The field has rapidly grown in terms of the reputation of its publication venues, established a vibrant community, and has demonstrated an increasing impact on policy and practice. However, the boundaries of the field are still being explored by many researchers in a bid to determine what differentiates a contribution in learning analytics from contributions in related fields, which also center around data in education. In this paper, we propose that instead of emphasizing the examination of differences, a healthy development of the field should focus on collaboration and be informed by the developments in related fields. Specifically, the paper presents a framework for analysis how contemporary fields focused on the study of data in education influence trends in learning analytics. The framework is focused on the methodological paradigms that each of the fields is primarily based on – i.e., essentialist, entatitive/reductionst, ontological/dialectical, and existentialist. The paper uses the proposed framework to analyze how learning analytics (ontological) is being methodologically influenced by recent trends in the fields of educational data mining (entatitive), quantitative ethnography (existentialist), and learning at scale (essentialist). Based on the results of the analysis, this paper identifies gaps in the literature that warrant future research.}

Hence, the provision of quality resources during the training phases is their central responsibility, the lack of online assistance offered by service providers is known to be the key cause of many difficulties. There is a need to create a system that can intelligently propose courses while considering a variety of viewpoints to enhance the learners' skills and knowledge. This research proposes an architecture that builds semantic recommendations with the aid of virtual agents based on user requirements and preferences, assisting academia in seeking appropriate courses in a real-world setting. The experimental and statistical results show that, when compared with existing techniques, the virtualized agent-based recommendation system not only improved user learning skills but also made course selection easier, depending on users’ interests and preferences.}

Its adoption in higher education is an innovation as well as a disruption to conventional learning mechanisms. To further understand its development from the perspective of academic communities, a hybrid bibliometric approach that combines both direct citation network analysis and text analytics was proposed to examine the related research articles retrieved from the Web of Science database. In addition to visual analytics on the TEL research, a direct citation network approach with cluster analysis was used to delineate the historiographic development of the TEL research domain in higher education. Among the top internally cited articles, five main streams of TEL development were identified, namely adoption, critique, social media, podcasting, and blended learning. Then, the accumulated state of knowledge was summarized by highlighting the essential subgroup topics in each stream with latent semantic analysis. The extraction of the key features of the research domain by the proposed hybrid approach, including the principal streams of development, associated subgroup topics, and a critical article list, contributes a comprehensive method to enable the rapid understanding of the overall research development of the TEL in higher education.}

Participants included 160 business students at local universities. The results indicated that students' motivation to use face-to-face learning had a great impact on their satisfaction, but this had only a marginal effect on their academic performance. On the other hand, students' motivation to use online learning significantly influences their learning satisfaction and, in turn, has a strong impact on their academic performance. As for the blended learning model, students’ motivation to use this mode of learning positively impacted their learning satisfaction.

The methodology employs a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm with dynamic resource allocation to optimize multiple objectives simultaneously. Adaptive learning control is incorporated to balance exploration and exploitation. Theoretical analyses provide convergence proofs for the proposed algorithms. Comprehensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed mechanisms compared to state-of-the-art approaches. The results show significant performance gains regarding solution quality, scalability, and computational efficiency.

Seventy-eight people joined Facebook groups to form statistics learning communities. Using weakly supervised machine learning (ML), we categorized students' Facebook messages into statistics-relevant and statistics-irrelevant. Results of the learning analytics on multimodal sources of student data showed that help-seeking positively predicted statistics achievement. In contrast, academic procrastination with ICT negatively predicted statistics achievement, controlling for students' demographics information, including age, gender, prior knowledge, and Internet/social media use. Moreover, the ensemble ML classified messages constructed by taking the sum of relevance coding (0 or 1) across three selected ML algorithms was highly aligned with the human coded message in terms of the degree of relevance to statistics. The ensemble ML classified messages were conceptualized as students’ cognitive engagement in statistics learning due to their high consistency with the human-labeled relevance coding and were positively associated with statistics achievement with a large effect size. The study contributed to developing an integrated learner-centered learning analytics framework with the PLE pedagogical design encompassing learner backgrounds and unstructured learner artifacts.}

Hierarchical and k-means cluster analysis are adopted to identify the regulation profiles, whereas ANCOVA and MANOVA are run to study how the regulation profiles are related to respectively students' performance and learner characteristics. The results revealed three regulation profiles, labelled as ‘all-round-oriented and affirming regulator’ (AOAR), ‘social-oriented and elaborating regulator’ (SOER), and ‘individual-oriented and passive regulator’'(IOPR). The regulation profiles differed significantly in their conceptual understanding, motivation for learning, and self-efficacy beliefs.

We use a large dataset of online traces from 135 students who completed 10 successive courses (i.e., 1350 course enrollments) in a higher education program. The methods used in this study have shown the feasibility of using trace data recorded by learning management systems to unobtrusively trace and model the longitudinal learning strategies across a program. We identified three program-level strategy trajectories: a stable and intense trajectory related to deep learning where students used diverse strategies and scored the highest grades; a fluctuating interactive trajectory, where students focused on course requirements, scored average grades, and were relatively fluctuating; and a light trajectory related to surface learning where students invested the least effort, scored the lowest grades, and had a relatively stable pathway. Students who were intensely active were more likely to transfer the intense strategies and therefore, they were expected to require less support or guidance. Students focusing on course requirements were not as effective self-regulators as they seemed and possibly required early guidance and support from teachers. Students with consistent light strategies or low effort needed proactive guidance and support.}

In AI-mediated language learning, the technology's metacognitive importance enables students to learn with AI as a partner, encouraging independent critical thinking. Within Zimmerman's SRL model, AI as a mind tool is integrated for improving language students' strategic employment in a cyclical process. A systematic review, following PRISMA protocols, examines the intersection of AI and self-regulated language learning (SRLL) over 2000–2022. Findings highlight AI's evolving role, predominantly through algorithms and systems, aiming for micro and macro integration. Interactive AI has not fully engaged in two-way directions, despite a familiar process approach in reviewed studies. In the favored ESL/EFL research context, task-specific AI is utilized to encourage cyclical improvement with learner autonomy enhancement mainly among higher education students at intermediate level or above. Pedagogical values are possible when major SRL phases are fully practiced, even without highly autonomous AI. Future research is directed toward adaptive personalized technology by exploring the dynamic interplay between AI technologies and SRLL as educational practices under Education 4.0 principles.}

The purpose of this study was to examine the relations between academic delay, motivational beliefs, and academic achievement in an online science course. The sample included one hundred and sixty-eight undergraduate students. Leveraging learning analytics and using multilevel modeling, this study found that academic delay was composed of habitual and momentary components. Controlling for motivational beliefs, habitual delay was significantly more negative than momentary delay in relation to academic achievement. The relation between academic delay and academic achievement was moderated by motivational beliefs. The negative effect of momentary delay on academic achievement was dependent on academic self-efficacy, while the negative effect of habitual delay on academic achievement was dependent on emotional cost. These findings further confirm that academic delay in online learning environments is not necessarily harmful for college students. Simply focusing on academic delay without considering who is engaging in such behavior could be misleading for future intervention.}

abstract = {Although spherical video-based virtual reality (SVVR) has gained attention as an effective tool for technology-enhanced learning, little research has been conducted on its integration in formal education settings and the role of teachers in facilitating its pedagogical use. In this study, a design-based research (DBR) approach was used to develop teacher-facilitated tactics for SVVR-supported learning based on virtual inquiry fieldwork in formal senior secondary geography education in Hong Kong. Over a period of 2 academic years, we engaged with nine teachers (from nine schools across the upper, middle, and lower academic bands in Hong Kong) and their Grade-10 classes, which comprised a total of 504 students. In addition to reporting and discussing the pedagogical effectiveness of the teacher facilitation practices designed, enacted, analysed, and refined in the iterative DBR process, this paper presents the teacher facilitation principles deduced from these practices. Overall, the findings and implications of this DBR are academically and practically relevant for researchers and educational practitioners who seek to utilise SVVR for educational purposes and strive to enhance its pedagogical effectiveness.}

To be effective, educators require extensive training in digital teaching methodologies. As such, there's a pressing need to examine and comprehend the intricacies of instructors' communication patterns within this context. This research addresses the pressing need to understand pedagogical discourse in online video lectures in Algebra classes by employing computational linguistic tools and natural language processing (NLP). Using transcripts from 125 Algebra 1 video lectures—comprising 4962 instances of pedagogical discourse—from five instructors at Math Nation, a virtual math learning environment, we analyzed the conveyance of linguistic, attitudinal, and emotional nuances. With the aid of 26 Coh-Metrix and SÉANCE features, we classified educators' language choices, achieving an accuracy of 86.7%. Furthermore, variations in language choices, as signified by discourse markers, were examined through a K-means clustering approach. The resulting 17 clusters were grouped into interpersonal, structural, and cognitive pedagogic functions. Through this exploration, we demonstrate the promising potential of NLP in efficiently deciphering pedagogical communication patterns in video lectures. These insights open a new avenue for research, aimed at assessing the efficacy of digital instruction by scrutinizing pedagogical discourse characteristics in computer-based learning environments.}

Further, there remain open questions about exactly which aspects of the multi-faceted peer feedback experience are most closely associated with learning outcomes. Within 13 different courses involving 2421 students, drawn across seven universities and six content disciplines, temporally lagged multiple-regression analyses were used to test the unique contributions of quantity, depth, and quality of received and provided comments to students’ growth in task performance across assignments. Meta-regression is applied to precisely estimating overall effect sizes and variation in effect sizes. Results reveal stronger relationships with growth in task performance for 1) provided rather than received comments, 2) longer rather than more comments, and 3) comments perceived to be helpful for revision. Further, there was largely quantitative and qualitative variation in observed relationships across courses that not attributable to statistical noise.}

A genre-based approach to writing assessment would suggest identifying key features of academic blogs, and in turn, utilizing those descriptions to guide learners in improving their writing performance. For this project, six knowledgeable individuals reviewed the academic blog posts written by 148 English as a foreign language university students in response to a prompt on the pros and cons of using technology for language learning. The reviewers sorted the posts into six groups in order of merit, and they described each post with short phrases. This data informed the creation of a blog-specific analytic rubric containing five categories around which the reviewers assessed learners’ written performance: task fulfillment and relevancy, content, organization and balance, genre specific features (i.e., use of emojis and hyperlinks), and language use.}

In response, educational institutions have rapidly expanded their virtual course offerings and assessment methods. One significant challenge in the realm of online education is the effective assessment of student involvement, engagement, and attentiveness during virtual classes. To address this challenge, we introduce a specialized system tailored to identifying and comprehending the complex range of student behaviors exhibited during online classes. Our system takes into account the diverse contexts and individual considerations that shape students' responses to the online learning environment. It employs user authentication through facial recognition technology and seamlessly integrates vital components, including facial detection, hand tracking, mobile phone detection, and pose estimation modules. Leveraging these components, we extract high-level features to construct a comprehensive dataset for training machine-learning models designed to detect students' attention levels during online classes. After evaluating six prominent machine learning algorithms, we have selected the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithm, which demonstrated an impressive 99.75% accuracy on the test data. Finally, the system generates a comprehensive anonymous report on the level of attentiveness of students, accessible through a dedicated webpage that includes a summary of the behavior of students throughout online classes, providing valuable insights for personalized interventions and enhanced online learning experiences.}

Underpinned by the assessment of material and energy balances, this tool processes the students’ answers using an algorithm able to generate and provide formative feedback based on personalised scores for each of the hundreds of variables that can be encountered in a material and energy balance for a realistic, system-level manufacturing process. These personalised values can then be used as a ‘stage-gate’ in the student understanding to attempt the more challenging components of the coursework before the final summative submission. Two different case studies (namely, acetone manufacturing and LNG processing) are presented in this article, with personalised feedback helping students to increase their marks by 23.3 and 6.8 absolute marks on average (out of 100), respectively, as compared to their original formative marks. The use of this efficient tool (ca. 1 -second processing time per individual student submission) can assist the students’ learning process as it promotes targeted engagement for developing their knowledge and skills; and it has the potential to become particularly valuable in engineering courses characterised by low staff to student ratios in which providing useful, personalised feedback with a quick turnaround becomes a gigantic challenge.}

With increasing use of social networks among university learners, its role in communication channels in connectivists teaching context needs examination.
Aims
This study investigates the role of communication channels in social networks as learners engage in a negotiation simulation RPG.
Samples
The current study collects data from 20 groups of learners in a fully online modality where learners are engaged in the negotiation simulation RPG.
Methods
Set in a fully online class, using a RPG that requires high levels of communication among participants, communication channel use is measured. Behavior data tracks actions between groups in the learning RPG database, allowing social network analysis.
Results
Results show social network apps are most often used by learners for both intra and intergroup conversations. Surprisingly, increased inter-group communication does not always improve learner performance in a connectivist setting. Instead, each additional communication quickly improves performance up to a certain point. After that point, more communication does not necessarily lead to better performance.
Conclusion
Instructors and administrators need to find ways to welcome technology platforms, like social media, into the classroom. However, social media platforms are in no way designed to fit a specific class and bring their own set of issues that can run counter to the class goals or instructional methods.}

To deal with uncertainty in the evaluation process, fuzzy theory is integrated into the model. To establish the house of quality matrix, technology-based stakeholders' requirements were identified and classified in four dimensions: economic and financial, technology adoption, sustainability, competencies. Moreover, nine supplier criteria were assumed. Based on expert evaluations, the results suggest that financial credit and supplier collaboration are the most prominent attributes to evaluate suppliers, while environmental commitment is sorted as the least important criterion. The results reveal that the three dominant suppliers, which provide the best response to the identified criteria, are providers of cloud service technology.}

However, research has found that learners often struggle to adapt their behaviour to the self-regulatory demands of DLEs. Furthermore, existing SRL analysis tools have limited utility for real-time or individualized prescriptive support of a learner's SRL strategy during a study session. In response to these challenges, we propose a novel approach using reinforcement learning as a framework to optimize the sequence of SRL processes for a learning task. This framework allows us to model and optimize the SRL strategy as a sequential decision-making problem, where each decision corresponds to an SRL process. The goal is to find an optimal sequence of decisions that maximizes performance in learning outcomes such as assessment score or learning gains. We compare the performance of our reinforcement learning framework with other sequential machine learning tools, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks and Genetic Algorithms (GA). The results of our study show that our reinforcement learning model outperforms GA and LSTM models in optimizing SRL strategy. The contributions of this work can facilitate the development of a tool which can detect sub-optimal SRL strategy in real-time and enable individualized SRL focused scaffolding.}

abstract = {The traditional “one size fits all” education system has been largely criticized in recent years on the ground of its lacking the capacity to meet individual student needs. Global education systems are leaning towards a more personalized, student-centered approach. Innovations like Big Data, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have given the modern-day technology to accommodate the distinctive features of human beings - smart machines and computers have been built to understand individual-specific needs. This opens an avenue for “personalization” in the education sector. From, mushrooming of Education Technology (EdTech) start-ups to government funding in AI research, it is evident that the next generation educational reforms would take a quantum leap forward piloted by Big Data analysis and AI. The objective of this paper is to organize the vast literature on the use of AI for personalization of education and to shed light on the key themes by which an AI-driven approach makes structural modifications to the existing education system. To this effect, the paper employed a systematic review using a Human-In-The-Loop natural language processing model of past two years' literature (2019–2021) in English language from IEEE Xplore on countries China, India and the USA. This process yielded more than 2000 search results at first and these were eventually shortlisted to 353 relevant papers for in-depth analysis. Being the pioneers in EdTech innovations, insights from research done in these three countries provides valuable input for the development of global education systems and research. The findings bring forward AI's success in catering to specific learning requirements, learning habits, and learning abilities of students and guiding them into optimized learning paths across all three countries. Not just that, it is also evident from the literature that AI augments educational content, customizes it for any individual according to their needs, and raises the flag of caution for anticipated learning difficulties. This recalibrates the role of instructors as well as optimizes the teaching-learning environment for a better learning experience. The upward trajectory of educational development with AI opens a new horizon of personalized education for the future generation, but also comes with its challenges. Data privacy issues, availability of digital resources, and affordability constraints have been reported in the recent literature as impediments in the way of promoting such technologies for day-to-day practice.}

Building on personalized education and adaptive learning systems models, this review provides an analytic framework to summarize key features of personalized feedback implementations and main empirical results. The systematic literature search resulted in 39 studies published in the last ten years. We found that scholars developed and investigated personalized feedback on the microscale, mesoscale, and macroscale of digital learning environments. However, the adaptive sources (To what is feedback adapted?) are mainly restricted to the current knowledge level and learning behavior data. Other interesting data sources for feedback adaptation remain underresearched, e.g., emotional state measures, progress measures, learning goals, or personality traits. Only a minority of the reviewed studies provided an empirical or theoretical rationale for assigning feedback messages to different types of students. Most studies report positive or at least mixed or neutral effects of personalized feedback on educational outcomes. This review discusses several implications for future directions in research on digitalized and personalized feedback. This study also adds to previous literature reviews on automatic and adaptive feedback that did not clearly distinguish task-adaptiveness and student-adaptiveness in digital feedback examples.}

abstract = {The purpose of this preregistered study was to examine whether patterns of teachers' race and gender biases found in prior research would emerge in a virtual teaching context. We asked a national sample of 989 teachers to evaluate student work pictured in screenshots of a virtual classroom showing students explaining their work. We randomly assigned the images of students depicted in the virtual classroom and tested whether the race or gender of the student would trigger biases with regard to teachers' evaluations of correctness, student ability, and recommendations that students be tested for gifted programs or special education services. We found no evidence of correctness or ability bias, but that teachers recommended male students more often to be tested for gifted programs and Black students for IEPs based on the same student work. We also conducted exploratory analyses revealing that school enrollment rates of Black students moderated teachers' ability and tracking biases.}

abstract = {Modern intelligent systems nowadays make significant use of human–computer interaction (HCI). Questions of human perception, human intelligence, human cognitive capabilities, human decision-making capabilities, and interactive techniques of visualization are dealt with by HCI. Whereas, the questions of machine intelligence and data mining is dealt with by knowledge discovery in databases (KDD). HCI mainly emphasizes supervised methods. Automatic computational methods can be worked upon by combining the capabilities of both HCI and KDD. The development of algorithms that are scalable for discovering earlier unknown associations in the data thus are based on automatic computational methods by combining the capabilities of both. The first HCI happens in the primitive years of a child. The digital era we are living in and all the more pandemics have made our education system adapt to the newest technology with open hands. Challenging times in the field of education have been conquered by the fast adaptation of the latest technology and trends. It is not going to stop here and will become an integral part of our education system. The latest technologies like artificial intelligence and data mining are known for their predictive capabilities and can play a significant role in the field of education, specifically in the higher education system. Every year a substantial number of graduates strive in the job market for decent employment opportunities. On the contrary, the economy of the world is not generating adequate employment opportunities. The pandemic has made the situation even worse with lots of job cutdowns. To increase the possibility of obtaining a decent job, institutes need to improve their academic qualification. They should also equip students with essential employability skills. Accurate prediction of graduates' employability at early stages such as in the very first year of their course enrollment can be of great help. This chapter projects a proposal for building a system that applies the KDD–HCI integrated approach by showcasing a case study for prediction of employability in higher education by using data generated and stored after HCI in various tests. The framework proposed in this chapter provides a generalized solution to students' employability prediction by integrating supervised and unsupervised techniques of artificial intelligence. These skills can be tested first with HCI by conducting various tests of students at the entry level. The scores obtained then go through the process of employability prediction with the help of the proposed framework, which can help in deciding the skills to be improved in an individual student before they compete, thus improving the chance of selection. Therefore, the proposed framework provides a customized solution to every student.}

abstract = {Teacher feedback provided to learners in real-time is a crucial factor for their knowledge and skills acquisition. However, providing real-time feedback at an individual level is often infeasible, considering limited teaching resources. Fortunately, recent technological advancements have allowed for developing of various computer tutoring systems, which can support learners at any place and time by generating personalized feedback automatically. Such systems have emerged in various domains, tackle different educational tasks, and often are designed in very distinctive ways. Consequently, the knowledge in the field of automated feedback systems is rather scattered across different domains and applications, as we illustrate in this study. This paper aims to outline the state-of-the-art of recently developed systems for delivering automated feedback, and thus serves as a source of systematic information for educators, researchers in the educational domain and system developers. More specifically, the contribution of this study is twofold. Firstly, we offer an extensive literature review of the field. As a result of a rigorous selection process, consisting of 4 phases, a total of 109 automated feedback systems is selected for a detailed review and thoroughly classified against numerous dimensions. Secondly, based on a detailed analysis of the recent literature sources and following the design science research approach, a classification framework for automated feedback systems is developed. This framework is used to classify the selected systems, and thus give a detailed overview of the predominantly available educational technologies, the educational settings in which they are applied, the properties of automated feedback they deliver, and the approaches for their design and evaluation. Based on this analysis, several important observations and recommendations are put forward as an outcome of the study. In particular, our study outlines the current fragmentation of the field, discusses a need for a common reference framework, and calls for more personalized, data-driven and student-centered solutions to exploit a larger set of opportunities offered in this age of data.}

We investigated the effectiveness of 40 pre-lecture videos covering basic concepts and 27 post-lecture tutorial videos focusing on practice in improving students' exam outcomes, especially for beginners in economics who may require more support from instructors than other students. We collected data about video engagement and students' grades in progress assessments. Surveys were conducted to gather students’ feedback regarding the usefulness of the videos on their learning. The findings showed that beginners engaged more with those videos, spent more time watching them compared to non-beginners. Furthermore, the study observed an improvement in beginners' exam performance, with their average grade increasing as a percentage of the average of non-beginners. These findings hold significance for instructors aiming to offer personalized assistance to students with varying levels of prior knowledge, thereby advancing educational practices in the field of economics.}

Despite its many advantages, including 24/7 access, high flexibility, rich content, and low cost, online learning suffers from high dropout rates that hamper pedagogical and economic goal outcomes. Enhanced student dropout prediction tools would help providers proactively detect students at risk of leaving and identify factors that they might address to help students continue their learning experience. Therefore, this study seeks to improve student dropout predictions, with three main contributions. First, it benchmarks a recently proposed logit leaf model (LLM) algorithm against eight other algorithms, using a real-life data set of 10,554 students of a global subscription-based online learning provider. The LLM outperforms all other methods in finding a balance between predictive performance and comprehensibility. Second, a new multilevel informative visualization of the LLM adds novel benefits, relative to a standard LLM visualization. Third, this research specifies the impacts of student demographics; classroom characteristics; and academic, cognitive, and behavioral engagement variables on student dropout. In reviewing LLM segments, these results show that different insights emerge for various student segments with different learning patterns. This notable result can be used to personalize student retention campaigns.}

This study is aiming to understand learners and associate their performances via exploiting academic help-seeking moods with online learning of institutional education setting. Adopting the relevant theories, we propose a novel research model and identify three different online help-seeking moods, which are namely goal-directed seeker, exploratory seeker and avoidant seeker. Goal-directed seekers are described with preference for more challenging assignments and more posting on the platform discussion board frequently. Exploratory seekers hold the highest achievements during all help-seeking moods. Avoidant seekers are well-distinguished by holding the lowest frequency of posting among all moods and the most average time spent on the platform. Students have collective preferences for assignment submission in each help-seeking mood, and deviation from those preferences increases their probability of dropping academic grade significantly. To the best of our knowledge, this research is the first work that characterizes the help-seeking moods and associates moods with the enrollment performance for online education of institutional student.}

We carried out a Systematic Literature Review study on the use of Emerging Technologies in higher education computing education to identify the state of the art in the use of these three groups of technologies for assessment and feedback practices. After systematic search and filtering from a search pool of 3038 studies published between 2016 and 2021, we selected 38 articles for detailed meta-analysis. Our findings reveal that 71% of the reviewed studies are journal articles, 50% studies focus on learning analytics, and the majority of the studies employ quantitative approaches. The results from this systematic review suggest that XR technologies have received least attention to date in computing education (amongst the emerging technologies considered for the review) and there is a lack of frameworks for design, evaluation and use of emerging technologies in higher education. The findings of this review will be beneficial for researchers and educators to obtain an in-depth understanding of the main areas of application of emerging technologies in higher education computing education, an inventory of emerging technology tools used for assessment and feedback, effectiveness indicators, and evaluation approaches that have been used. For evidence-based guidance on future assessment and feedback practices using emerging technologies, we also present a brief research agenda, drawing attention to the need to trial more XR, focus on formative assessment and feedback practices, better understand impact of human-centric issues and take more thoughtful consideration of ethics in the use of emerging technologies in computing education.}

Engagement with this challenge has the potential to lead to the provision of interfaces that allow students to access these resources and become independent learners. It is therefore important to identify and evaluate the features of such interfaces to calibrate and respond to individual student needs. In this context, the quality of differentiated support for learning, referred to as scaffolding, is established as paramount to the design and structure of online environments. In this study, the instructional design referred to as predict, observe, explain and evaluate (POEE), informed by constructivist theories of learning, to implement multiple scaffolding strategies is described. The POEE scaffolding strategy was applied in the creation of two inquiry learning modules. Student engagement with these inquiry modules in a self-directed online environment was explored to identify critical elements of the scaffolding. The findings of this study, based on students' interactions and engagement with the learning modules, enabled the conceptualisation of a multimodal scaffolding strategy for self-directed inquiry. We propose that the recommendations from the implementation of these scaffolded learning modules can represent exemplars illustrative of an enriched instructional design paradigm to support students’ independent study in blended environments.}

However, emerging empirical research has shown inconsistent correlations between specific teacher talk moves (TTMs) and student achievement, motivating us to synthesise previous results to provide robust evidence. Using three-level meta-analytic techniques, this study examined the associations between teacher talk (dialogic and monologic orientations), specific TTMs, and student achievement in K–12 classrooms. Based on a synthesis of 16 studies with 51 effect sizes, we found a significant positive correlation between teacher talk and student achievement (r = .19). For the two orientations of teacher talk, dialogic teacher talk was moderately correlated with student achievement (r = .25), whereas monologic teacher talk was not significantly related to student achievement (r = .05). In terms of specific dialogic TTMs, analyses revealed significant and moderate associations of inviting students to share ideas and asking uptake questions with student achievement (r = .40 and r = .26, respectively), whereas high-quality feedback from teachers was not significantly related to student achievement (r = .26). Furthermore, the relationship between dialogic teacher talk and student achievement was mediated by student engagement, but not moderated by geographical region, grade level, achievement domain, or measure of teacher talk. This study sheds light on the importance of dialogic pedagogical approaches in relation to academic achievement, as well as the centrality of teachers’ encouragement of students to share, articulate, and co-construct ideas in creating dialogic educational environments.}

However, little is known about how individual differences in motivational factors, such as achievement goals, relate to how students learn within multimedia environments that include instructional videos and generative strategies. Therefore, in this study, we explored how achievement goals predicted undergraduate students’ behaviors when learning with instructional videos that required students to answer practice questions between videos, as well as how those activities predicted subsequent unit exam performance one week later. Additionally, we tested the best measurement models for modeling achievement goals between traditional confirmatory factor analysis and bifactor confirmatory factor analysis. The bifactor model fit our data best and was used for all subsequent analyses. Results indicated that stronger mastery goal endorsement predicted performance on the practice questions in the multimedia learning environment, which in turn positively predicted unit exam performance. In addition, students’ time spent watching videos positively predicted practice question performance. Taken together, this research emphasizes the availing role of adaptive motivations, like mastery goals, in learning from instructional videos that prompt the use of generative learning strategies.}

Overall, while there were differences between learning contexts, SRL, and performance, many variables were not significant predictors of performance. Online learners who were confident, managed their time well and regulated their efforts saw the greatest benefits, though these effects were small when viewed individually. Blended learners, to a lesser extent, also benefited from confidence and effort regulation. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first study to test SRL characteristics as drivers of performance during a formative task across two learning contexts.}

abstract = {This chapter proposes a Technology-Enhanced Learning application which exploits both Human Computation and Learning Analytics to improve the learning and teaching of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics while reducing the teachers’ workload. Specifically, the application aims at tracking and reducing learners’ misconceptions and easing teachers’ corrections of homework. To achieve this goal, the proposed software uses text processing, collaborative filtering, and teacher collaboration in a wiki-like environment. While the software has not been implemented as a whole, its main components have been implemented and evaluated in several case studies. These studies point to the realizability and effectiveness of the approach.}

abstract = {To provide students with high-quality, tailored content, higher education institutions face the challenge of helping their instructors produce their own materials. New learning objects are usually assessed when students actually use the materials. To improve quality assurance in the design of learning objects, this paper proposes systemically analyzing the user experience of new learning objects. This involves not only considering student feedback, but also integrating other perspectives into a continuous feedback loop, through a participatory design approach. The proposed framework was tested during the implementation of a flipped classroom initiative in a large Chilean university over a period of six months, involving 6 content designers, 3 teachers, 2 teaching assistants and 98 students. We observe how elements of feedback are integrated through a systemic assessment, where the end result (the learning object) is contrasted with the elements that guided its creation (the design guidelines). In this way, the roles of designer and user are complemented so as to identify design gaps early on in the process of creating a solution. This study adds to the current literature by relating design guidelines with the principles of instruction during the design process in order to ensure the overall quality of the learning objects.}

abstract = {Given the inclusion of (often team-based) course projects in tertiary software engineering education, it is necessary to investigate software engineering curricula and students’ experiences while undergoing their software engineering training. Previous research efforts have not sufficiently explored students perceptions around the commitment and adequacy of effort spent on software engineering projects, their project performance and skills that are developed during course projects. This gap in skills awareness includes those that are necessary, anticipated and learned, and the challenges to student project success, which may predict project performance. Such insights could inform curricula design, theory and practice, in terms of improving post-study software development success. We conducted a survey involving undergraduate across four universities in New Zealand and Cyprus to explore these issues, where extensive deductive and inductive analyses were performed. Among our findings we observe that students’ commitment of effort on software engineering project seems appropriate. Students are more satisfied with their team’s collaboration performance than technical contributions, but we found that junior students seemed to struggle with teamwork. Further, we observe that the software students developed were of higher quality if they had worked in project teams previously, had stronger technical skills and were involved in timely meetings. This study singles out mechanisms for informing good estimation of effort, mentoring technical competencies and suitable coaching for enhancing project success and student learning.}

Metacognitive processes play a vital role in self-regulated learning. Students become active participants in their learning, and one critical aspect of higher education studies is planning and time management. The exam taking behaviour is in the context of the FME manifestation of the time management skills of each student; thus, the exam-taking patterns may help identify at-risk students. To evaluate the importance of exam behaviour patterns, we conducted three experiments. Identification of students passing or failing the first study year has been conducted using four different machine learning models. The exam taking behaviour patterns increase the prediction F-measure significantly for the class of failing students (approximately 0.3 increase). Moreover, the approach based on student behaviour enabled us to identify the critical exam-taking patterns, which further helps the lecturers identify at-risk students and improve their time management skills and chances to pass the first academic year.}

abstract = {Researchers and many educators agree that the ability to self-regulate learning is important for academic success. Yet, many students struggle to anticipate learning difficulties and adjust accordingly. Further, despite theorizing that self-regulated learning involves adaptation across learning cycles, few researchers have examined students’ evaluative judgments, their implications for students’ behavior in a subsequent learning cycle, or their effects on achievement. Utilizing data from a large, introductory college biology course, we examined how struggling students’ evaluative judgments made after a first unit exam predicted changes in learning behaviors as well as how those changes predicted performance on a subsequent exam. We used natural language processing to analyze data from a reflective essay written after a first unit exam, identifying language that reflected evaluation of prior studying and plans to adapt learning. Then, we utilized digital traces of learning behaviors to measure students’ actual adaptation of their use of learning resources. Results from a path analysis revealed students’ evaluations predicted how extensively they discussed plans to adapt their learning process. Plans to adapt described in written reflections predicted an increase in the frequency of desirable learning behaviors, which in turn predicted higher subsequent exam scores, after controlling for previous exam performance. These findings provide empirical evidence of multiple theorized self-regulated learning processes, including how evaluations of learning at the end of a learning cycle can inform planning and behavior changes in a subsequent learning cycle, and that increases in the enactment of effective learning strategies predict improved performance in complex learning tasks.}

The prediction of the emotional state of a learner can enhance the outcome of learning by including designated mediation. Many techniques are developed for anticipating emotional states using video, audio, and bio-sensors. Still, examining video, and audio will not confirm secretiveness and is exposed to security issues. Here the creator devises a fusion technique, to be specific Squirrel Search and Rider optimization-grounded Deep LSTM for affect prediction. The Deep LSTM is trained to exercise the new fusion SS-ROA. Then, the SS-ROA-grounded Deep LSTM classifies the states like frustration, confusion, engagement, wrathfulness, and so on. It is based on the interaction log data of the E-learner. In conclusion, the course and student ID, predicted state, test marks, and course completion status are taken as result information to find out the correlations. The new algorithm gives the best performance in comparison to other present methods with the highest prediction accurateness of 0.962 and the most noteworthy connection of 0.379 respectively. After discovering affective states, students may get the advantage of getting real comments from a teacher for improving one's performance during learning. However, such systems should also give feedback about the learner's affective state or passion because it greatly affects the student's encouragement toward better learning.}

To investigate how collaborative learning happens through online communication, studying learners' interactions is of crucial importance. Accordingly, the present quantitative ethnographic study used an epistemic network analysis (ENA) approach to investigate social and cognitive presence in students' interactions based on the community of inquiry (CoI) framework. To do so, students’ interactions via an online annotation tool called Nowcomment in a computer-assisted language learning course (CALL) were collected and examined. The data was coded based on the social presence indicators and cognitive presence phases of CoI. ENA was used to visualize the relationships between social indicators and cognitive phases for all the students, for high and low score students, and at the beginning and end of the course. The results indicated that among social presence indicators, the affective category had the weakest, and the interactive had the strongest relationships with cognitive phases, especially exploration, and integration. There were connections between social indicators and cognitive phases of, triggering and exploration for high score students, and exploration and integration for low scores. Additionally, the present study did not show any improvement toward resolution, the last phase of cognitive development.}

Researchers also argue that formative assessment enhances students' learning, while studies find formative assessment difficult to implement. To investigate these paradoxes and better understand how teachers use digital tools in formative assessment and with what result, we conducted a systematic review of teachers' technology use in formative assessment practices in primary and secondary education. Systematic searches identified 22 relevant articles that are included in the review. We found unclear definitions of formative assessment across studies and document challenges teachers encounter when they use technology for formative assessment purposes. We conclude with three prerequisites for teachers' successful technology use in formative assessment practices: 1) clear definitions of formative assessment, 2) alignment between digital tools and pedagogical practice, and 3) data literacy to examine and interpret information and use this to improve students’ learning. The review also documents knowledge gaps in current research.}

Many higher education institutions are shifting from an instructivist delivery (lectures) to a constructivist approach (workshops). In attempts to maximize the students' engagement, performance and learning outcomes, their readiness to learn also needs to be considered. This mixed-methods research paper investigates students’ perspectives of the impacts of a teaching and learning (T&L) transition in a project management program. Traditional delivery through lectures and tutorials, was replaced with flipped-blended learning through workshops. The study finds that the transition is generally well received. Engaged students are likely to perform well in a flipped workshop environment. However, scaffolding to prepare students for transition to flipped learning is key for driving knowledge gains, performance, engagement, collaboration and the overall positive learning experience.}

Such factors may result in either a stable, declining or fluctuating engagement trajectory. While research on online engagement is abundant, most authors have examined student engagement in a single course or two. Little research has been devoted to studying online longitudinal engagement, i.e., the evolution of student engagement over a full educational program. This learning analytics study examines the engagement states (sequences, successions, stability, and transitions) of 106 students in 1396 course enrollments over a full program. All data of students enrolled in the academic year 2014–2015, and their subsequent data in 2015–2016, 2016–2017, and 2017–2018 (15 courses) were collected. The engagement states were clustered using Hidden Markov Models (HMM) to uncover the hidden engagement trajectories which resulted in a mostly-engaged (33% of students), an intermediate (39.6%), and a troubled (27.4%) trajectory. The mostly-engaged trajectory was stable with infrequent changes, scored the highest, and was less likely to drop out. The troubled trajectory showed early disengagement, frequent dropouts and scored the lowest grades. The results of our study show how to identify early program disengagement (activities within the third decile) and when students may drop out (first year and early second year).}

Internal and external collaboration was primarily facilitated through online technologies. The study employs the Value Creation framework to analyze the types and value of co-created learning and explores these results to draw inferences as to the effects of CoP participation on the learners' identities, which were continuously being reformulated. The resulting CoP interactions indicated a strong immediate learning value. These also generated new insights (potential value) and familiarized learners with the characteristics of the real-world practice. The effective transfer of knowledge into the academic practice was confirmed by the significant improvements in student performances (applied & realized value). Finally, CoP participation steered a shift in learner perspectives, by pragmatically transforming their perception of achievement and orientating them towards transitioning and evolving in the professional sphere (reframed value).}

To this end, a campus-based course in applied physics for master and doctoral students was transformed into an online flipped course. We analyse how this transformation and student participation in specific asynchronous and synchronous learning activities affect performance for the online flipped format. Results reveal that, while there was no statistically significant difference in average performance between the campus-based and online flipped format, the online flipped format led to a significantly larger spread - a polarization - in performance. Further, drawing on transactional distance theory, we attribute this polarization to a higher oscillation in transactional distance for the online flipped format. This link between transactional distance and performance constitutes the main theoretical contribution of this paper. Our findings speak to the importance of analysing shifts in transactional distance across learning activities to better understand their potential to bolster student learning. Future research would do well to focus on how students experience such shifts in transactional distance, and online instructors need to consider how to scaffold students during these shifts.}

However, from the perspectives of social presence, it was hypothesized that for learners who were unfamiliar to their peers in online collaborative learning environments, performing explicit socializing activities prior to learning phases would help them have better learning performance, experience lower levels of working memory load, and experience higher levels of social presence than performing implicit socializing activities. This research was conducted to test the hypotheses with 60 participants. The results showed that providing explicit socializing activities to unfamiliar learners in mobile-assisted collaborative learning environments increased the level of social presence, facilitated their acquisition of complex cognitive skills such as EFL argument essay writing skills, and reduced the level of cognitive load in learning. These results are discussed in light of human cognitive architecture and the social presence theory.}

Therefore, we carried out a systematic review of a 30-year sample of OLM studies in higher education and identified 64 articles that study the use of OLMs in supporting SRL. Our findings show that OLMs have been mainly used to support learners' cognition and a bit less metacognition and motivation; however, emotional support has been rarely provided. The most supported ones are Appraisal and Performance phases; Preparation of learning is enhanced by OLMs not so often. Although learners can edit or negotiate with their learning model in advanced ways, a simple inspectable OLM is more preferred. Reliance on unobservable nodes is less favored in modeling techniques in OLMs because such methods are highly dependent on expert authoring, thereby time-intensive and costly. Comparison and color-coding are two most-used features in OLMs, where the comparison feature is often used for enhancing learners’ engagement and motivation.}

abstract = {As a fundamental research task for intelligent education, knowledge tracing (KT) aims to trace learners’ dynamic knowledge states and predict their future performance based on their historical response data. However, learners’ cognitive processes cannot be studied in isolation from the context; nevertheless, existing knowledge tracing models mainly use knowledge topology as auxiliary information but do not deeply explore the contextual information of exercises. Thus, an in-depth exploration of multi-layer contextual information in learning scenarios is required, focusing on the cognitive differences among different learners. Furthermore, knowledge tracing models exhibit limited interpretability compared with cognition diagnosis methods integrating educational priors. To address these issues, we propose a multi-layer context-aware deep knowledge tracing (MLC-DKT) model. Specifically, we first present the multi-layer contextual representation method involving knowledge concepts and exercises. In the knowledge state tracing module, we incorporate the learners’ knowledge priors into the attention mechanism to capture the evolution of the learners’ knowledge. Then, we develop a calculation method for the similarity effect among the contextual information, which helps estimate the learners’ knowledge states. In the learning performance prediction module, we introduce the guessing and slipping factors from the cognition diagnosis model to optimize the MLC-DKT model, further improving the performance of the KT model. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets, demonstrating that the MLC-DKT model provides improved predictions of learner performance. Moreover, the MLC-DKT model realizes contextual awareness from knowledge concepts and exercises, making the predictions more interpretable.}

Our study addresses such a gap and investigates how engagement evolves or changes over time, using a person-centered approach to identify for whom the changes happen and when. We take advantage of a novel and innovative multistate Markov model to identify what variables influence such transitions and with what magnitude, i.e., to answer the why. We use a large data set of 1428 enrollments in six courses (238 students). The findings show that online engagement changes differently —across students— and at different magnitudes —according to different instructional variables and previous engagement states. Cognitively engaging instructions helped cognitively engaged students stay engaged while negatively affecting disengaged students. Lectures —a resource that requires less mental energy— helped improve disengaged students. Such differential effects point to the different ways interventions can be applied to different groups, and how different groups may be supported. A balanced, carefully tailored approach is needed to design, intervene, or support students' engagement that takes into account the diversity of engagement states as well as the varied response magnitudes that intervention may incur across diverse students’ profiles.}

Analysis suggested up to 23% of the variation in course performance could be attributed to between-group effects. Further, a series of 10 multilevel temporal models suggested no substantive effects in the first half of the course, though in the second half of the course, groups that co-created more complete course notes tended to exhibit improved average student performance. We speculate that the learning advantages afforded to student groups that produce more complete course notes may be delayed.

This study investigates the potentials of emerging computing paradigms and proposes a novel mobile edge-based hierarchical architecture to optimize m-learning performance efficiency. The architecture's design follows the ETSI MEC ISG framework and ISG MEC technical requirements. An m-learning use case was executed to evaluate the architecture's performance efficiency in a university facility. The implementation results show reduced latencies and quick response time. The architecture handles data locally on-site, lowers demand on radio access bandwidth, increases confidential data privacy, and continues the application execution even the network is disrupted. The architecture is open to redesign, reconfigure, and integrate with other computing paradigms. IoT-based m-learning use cases should be considered by reflecting learners' scaling of resource needs. Execution of complex use cases will expand the architecture base, MEC-based learning models usage, and change learning-teaching dynamics across educational disciplines.}

The data sources included the participant teachers’ screencasts, peer reflective comments/responses, and semi-structured interviews. The findings demonstrated that the experience of LS-oriented, digitallymediated writing instruction facilitated the writing teachers’ firsthand exploration of digital spaces and promoted their digitallymediated teaching competence through peer reflection, team coaching, and project-based practices. Additionally, the experience enhanced their pedagogical flexibility, confidence, and autonomy for adapting writing instruction to virtual platforms, assisted them in developing technology-mediated writing lesson plan, task design, and assessment rubric, engaged them in a small community of L2 writing teachers as digital materials co-producers, and helped them use digital tools to meet learners’ context-specific writing needs.

Using the activity theory as a coding framework, this systematic review contributes to the literature by investigating how previous studies have designed SRL supports for students in the flipped classroom context. Our analysis of 22 empirical articles indicates that mixed results were found from the previous studies’ SRL supporting methods during flipped learning on students’ academic performance and SRL development.

The respondents included native residents of Poland, as well as migrants from countries of the former Soviet Union. We analyze survey responses provided by 317 respondents. We used the chi-squared test, the Kruskal-Wallis test, and the Mann-Whitney test to verify relationships between variables. According to the analysis, the student engagement variable determines the current evaluation of online studying, the change in frequency of participation since the introduction of online classes, and the preferred mode of study (online or offline). The time required to commute to the business school determines only the preferred mode of study in the future, while students' nationality determines their assessment of online studying and the frequency of participation in online courses.}

Using an autoethnographic account of the lived experiences of a multiple instructor team, this study focused on a subject delivered to first-year students transitioning to the university during pre-COVID and post-COVID (two teaching semesters in 2019 and two teaching semesters in 2020). Despite higher levels of assumed digital literacy, we found that first-year university students of the digital generation required more structure than autonomy. We argue that instructor collaboration ensures consistency of a team approach to teaching in a BL environment and improves student transition to autonomous learning. We suggest practices and policies for teaching large student cohorts involving multiple instructors and offer insight to explore further TDT can be considered in this regard.}

During this time, most activities had to be adjusted to ensure that students were not penalized in their learning. Unlike formal supervised exams, online assessments were undertaken pending the return of formal exams after the pandemic. As a consequence, e-learning has been eye-opening in that it has fostered an open assessment system with new modes of assessment. The immediate question that arose was whether academic integrity was indeed embraced or not. In the new learning paradigm, all forms of assessment seemed less formalized. Dissertations, group assignments, coursework, and individual assignments as well as online exams had to be examined to ensure that each component of teaching evaluation should be linked to assurance quality in order to maintain the quality of teaching and learning. A survey by questionnaire was carried out among a hundred students from the Université des Mascareignes in Mauritius. The main conclusions indicated that each form of assessment should have its own quality assurance framework adapted while allowing a variety of assessments in the new learning system henceforth favored by the institution. Far from being skeptical about the effectiveness of open learning systems, it was seen that such a mechanism had significance in terms of quality assurance provided that the key levers are duly applied and respected.}

Immersive technologies have become increasingly common worldwide, helping educators to improve the quality of dance pedagogy and increase the effectiveness of dance training. The article investigates the ways of using immersive technologies powered by artificial intelligence in dance education. The research explores the theoretical literature on dance education and the use of artificial intelligence in dance education and dance choreography. The scholars examine the impact of innovative technology solutions used in dance pedagogical practice on the development of dance skills in students. The study also discusses the functionality of interactive and multimedia dance teaching systems, including AI-powered virtual mentoring and cognitive simulations of human mind operations. The research analysed the use of virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR) in dance education. This research also focuses on mobile applications used for teaching modern dance. The proposed framework for dance education is based on digital technologies, which help to develop dance skills and improve teaching practices. The scholars conclude that the development and improvement of dance skills are possible only if a teacher combines virtual and real environments in everyday practices. The findings can be used by dance teachers, professional dancers, software developers, and researchers who examine the innovative practices and the application of artificial intelligence in dance education. The ecosystem model reframes thinking about approaches to dance education and can serve as the basis for further development of dance courses and dance style teaching modes.}

Utilizing the data from 139 interventions and 375 effect sizes, we found (a) a strong effect of learning computer programming per se (Hedges’ g‾ = 0.81, 95% CI [0.42, 1.21]), (b) moderate to large effect sizes of visualization (g‾ = 0.44, 95% CI [0.29, 0.58]) and physicality interventions (g‾ = 0.72, 95% CI [0.23, 1.21]), and (c) moderate to large effect sizes for studies focusing on dominant instructional approaches (g‾s = 0.49–1.02). Moderator analyses indicated that the effect sizes differed only marginally between the instructional approaches and conditions—however, collaboration in metacognition instruction, problem solving instruction outside of regular lessons, short-term interventions focusing on physicality, and interventions focusing on visualization through Scratch were especially effective. Our meta-analysis synthesizes the existing research evidence on the effectiveness of computer programming instruction and, ultimately, provides references with which the effects of future studies could be compared.}

abstract = {The interaction between people and computers takes place everywhere in everyday life through information processing. As the degree of contact between humans and computers continues to increase, the cognitive burden of interaction between humans and computers increases as the operating errors rate increases. HCI scientists examine and create particular technology user interfaces. They research and enhance technology development processes and develop and assess new technological applications. HCI has gradually merged its scientific interests to improve the usability and the technical understanding and technique of computer systems. Artificial intelligence (HCI-AI) based problems in human-computer interactions are suggested to identify the relationship between cognitive knowledge and the comprehension of natural and artificial intelligence forms. The models describe the relationship between HCI research and the conception of interactions between humans and computers. A model of the planning and controlling numerous tasks at medical reception and their hypothesis illustrates the relationships defined thus. The proposal proposes to evaluate links between other studies and the design of human-make-computer interactions by using the relations described for HCI and cognitive science. The paper recommends that any discipline such as cognitive science, which has a relationship between its research and the design of the human-computer interactions, should perform this assessment. Such an evaluation would determine whether or not the relationship is specified. The article suggests that better relationships are necessary to provide more effective research support to develop interaction between humans and computers.}

It makes building models to predict students’ performance accurately in such an environment even more challenging. This paper proposes a Two-Way Neural Network (TWNN) model based on the bidirectional recurrent neural network and graph neural network to predict students’ next semester’s course performance using only their previous course achievements. Extensive experiments on a real dataset show that our model performs better than the baselines in many indicators.}

Creativity not only affects originality and innovation but also increases the utility of products and ideas, thus yielding a competitive advantage in the market. Although studies have demonstrated that creativity can be practically assessed through student innovation or responses to creativity questionnaires, few studies have explored how creativity is developed. Therefore, this study developed a model for predicting creativity based on the discussion records of students during creative activities. The model was designed using the Chinese Knowledge Information Processing tokenization system, a term frequency–inverse document frequency method, and support vector machines. The experimental results revealed a model accuracy of 93 %, thus demonstrating the model’s feasibility for predicting creativity. Furthermore, the students’ key terms were obtained by using k-means clustering with the proposed model, thus yielding valuable supplementary information for exploring the development of creative ideas. These results revealed that data mining has substantial value in creativity education. Therefore, the proposed predictive model is suitable for predicting creativity in learning activities based on discussion records. It can support teachers’ assessment of student performance and provision of timely guidance and feedback to enhance creative thinking and stimulate imagination among engineering students.}

In this work, the problem of decision support is described in the automated compilation of an individual training module in distance education based on considering the emotional states of students. The work formulates the existing problems of distance education. An overview of existing research in the field of accounting and recognition of emotions in education is given. The problem of managing the process of distance learning, considering the emotional states of students and their individual characteristics, is given. It is proposed to introduce emotional support in the learning process and select the form of presentation of the material adequate to the student’s state. The results of an experiment on 80 students with different personality types are presented. The analysis of the results showed that the emotional state of the students, who used the developed decision support system in teaching, became much better.

abstract = {Educational institutions and users involved in the whole learning process frequently have concerns about the storage and processing of sensitive data and essential apps in the cloud. Security and privacy issues have emerged as a major challenge, limiting cloud computing’s implementation in educational environments. Several users have yet to meet this security challenge, which is linked to the system’s multi-tenancy nature and the outsourcing of resources and data. This study proposes a secure framework for protecting cloud-based educational systems from hacking using a unique encryption technique, as well as a deep learning-based classification for cloud attack detection. Initially, we preprocess the data and extract features using a gray-level covariance matrix (GLCM). Next, we propose a classification based on multiple convolutional neural networks (M−CNN) to detect attacks in the cloud environment. Finally, we propose a modified digital signature algorithm (MDSA) for data encryption and decryption. The proposed technique achieved high security rates, with an accuracy of 97.7%, sensitivity of 96%, specificity of 94.3%, precision of 99.6%, and recall of 97%. Comparative evaluations showed that the proposed mechanism outperformed other encryption techniques. This novel model enhances the security of cloud-based educational systems and promotes users’ confidence in such platforms.}

abstract = {There is a huge and growing amount of data that is already captured in the many, diverse digital tools that support learning. Additionally, learning data is often inaccessible to teachers or served in a manner that fails to support or inform their teaching and design practice. We need systematic, learner-centred ways for teachers to design learning data that supports them. Drawing on decades of Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED) research, we show how to make use of important AIED concepts: (1) learner models; (2) Open Learner Models (OLMs); (3) scrutability and (4) Ontologies. We show how these concepts can be used in the design of OLMs, interfaces that enable a learner to see and interact with an externalised representation of their learning progress. We extend this important work by demonstrating how OLMs can also drive a learner-centred design process of learning data. We draw on the work of Biggs on constructive alignment (Biggs, 1996, 1999, 2011), which has been so influential in education. Like Biggs, we propose a way for teachers to design the learning data in their subjects and we illustrate the approach with case studies. We show how teachers can use this approach today, essentially integrating the design of learning data along with the learning design for their subjects. We outline a research agenda for designing the collection of richer learning data. There are three core contributions of this paper. First, we present the terms OLM, learner model, scrutability and ontologies, as thinking tools for systematic design of learning data. Second, we show how to integrate this into the design and refinement of a subject. Finally, we present a research agenda for making this process both easier and more powerful.}

This study aimed to investigate the incorporation of formative assessment into a flipped jigsaw learning context and examine its effects on learning engagement and HOTS in an undergraduate business marketing course. A quasi-experimental design was used in this study, with two groups: control with flipped jigsaw learning and traditional summative assessment and experimental with flipped jigsaw learning and formative assessment. Each group consisted of 25 students, all enrolled in the undergraduate business administration department at an Indonesian vocational tertiary education institution. Questionnaires and student assignment scores were used to collect data. According to the findings, flipped jigsaw learning with extended formative assessment improved learning engagement and HOTS more than flipped jigsaw learning with traditional summative assessment. This study's findings may contribute to advancing theories and practices on how formative assessment has recently been explored as a learning tool embedded in flipped jigsaw learning in international business education.}

A design-based study nested within a factorial repeated measures design with a single group of pre-service teachers is conducted to fulfill this aim. Thirty-eight junior pre-service teachers, enrolled in an early childhood education department at a middle-sized university in Turkey, were recruited for the study. The primary data collection tool in this study was argument maps generated by pre-service teachers on various pedagogical and authentic cases by using an online free tool. Assessing critical thinking and the quality of argument maps, two different types of rubrics (holistic vs analytic) that appear to have the face and construct validity were located. Experimental evidence supports statistically significant progress in pre-service teachers’ critical thinking scores after engaging in deliberate computer-assisted argument mapping practices regularly as homework assignments. There is also sufficient evidence to suggest a moderate relationship between critical thinking and argument quality. The study advances our knowledge of engaging in deliberate computer assisted practices to be an appropriate course of action for promoting critical thinking by helping pre-service teachers diagram qualified arguments. It is apparent in this study the success of the use of a computer assisted argument mapping tool for promoting CT depends on to what extend students are engaged in constructing better argument maps with each round of practice and scaffold.}

To describe one institution's approach to transformation of high-stakes objective structure clinical examinations (OSCEs) from norm-referenced to criterion-referenced standards setting and to evaluate the impact of these changes on OSCE performance and pass rates.
Educational activity and setting
The OSCE writing team at the college selected a modified Angoff method appropriate for high-stakes assessments to replace the two standard deviation method previously used. Each member of the OSCE writing team independently reviewed the analytical checklist and calculated a passing score for active stations on OSCEs. Then the group met to determine a final pass score for each station. The team also determined critical cut points for each station, when indicated. After administration of the OSCEs, scores, pass rates, and need for remediation were compared to the previous norm-referenced method. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the data.
Findings
OSCE scores remained relatively unchanged when switched to a criterion-referenced method, but the number of remediators increased up to 2.6 fold. In the first year, the average score increased from 86.8% to 91.7% while the remediation rate increased from 2.8% to 7.4%. In the third year, the average increased from 90.9% to 92% while the remediation rate increased from 6% to 15.6%. Likewise, the fourth-year average increased from 84.9% to 87.5% while the remediation rate increased from 4.4% to 9%.
Summary
Transition to a modified Angoff method did not impact average OSCE score but did increase the number of remediations.}

However, it is not always the case that received feedback is implemented. Currently, there is uncertainty regarding how the total number of comments received during a peer feedback activity interacts with the number of implemented comments and subsequent text quality. Therefore, the present study examined the online peer feedback sessions of 186 graduate students enrolled in a scientific writing course at a Korean university. It aimed to investigate the possible moderating effect of the total number of comments on the relationship between implementation of comments and student writing performance. The results showed that there is no relationship between the number of received comments and student writing performance. Furthermore, no significant correlation was observed between the number of implemented comments and student writing performance. However, importantly, a moderating effect of the total number of comments on the relationship between implementation of comments and student writing performance was found. In other words, the more total comments students receive, the less their implementation will be associated with significant improvement of writing quality. This result is significant because it suggests that in online collaborative learning contexts, there is an upper limit of peer comments, above which the original author can no longer effectively implement them to improve writing performance.}

Three distinctive types of pre-class learning profiles emerged from the study, including the lecture-focused and low time-spent profile, lecture-quiz-balanced and average time-spent profile, and quiz-focused and high time-spent profile. The results show that students' performance trajectories were significantly different among the three learning profiles.

Online trace data analysis, an emerging approach, provides the promise of greater authenticity and convenience in measuring SRL as compared to self-reports. We conducted a systematic review of online trace data analysis that measured SRL in various learning platforms to address three research questions: “How did previous studies use online trace data as indicators of SRL?“, “What approaches are being used to interpret the online trace data?“, and “What are the challenges of using online trace data to measure SRL?“. We systematically searched seven bibliographic databases with specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. A total of 38 empirical studies were eventually examined. We leveraged the two most cited SRL models as theoretical basis and mapped the various online trace data into relevant SRL process to answer the first research question. Two commonly adopted approaches to interpret the online trace data were identified. Three key challenges pertaining to the use of trace data to measure SRL were identified: time segmentation, generalization, and validity. We discussed these challenges and the possible means to mitigate them. Finally, we propose a flowchart to guide future studies in conducting online trace data analysis in SRL research.}

abstract = {This paper describes an instructional approach and exercises to introduce a data analytics tool into an existing course that covers relational databases and structured query language (SQL). SQL and relational databases are traditional topics in many AIS classes and are frequently taught with established technologies such as Microsoft Access. With the onset of newer data analytics tools, educators are faced with the challenge of incorporating emerging technologies while still covering basic foundational concepts. In this paper, we position SQL as the mental model for learning the data preparation and data blending features of a popular analytics tool, Alteryx. We split the traditional SQL content from our course into four increments that increase in complexity. For each increment, we use a multi-step approach to first develop students’ mental model of the SQL query code and then apply the mental model to the new environment of Alteryx. For each increment, students solve the same set of problems in SQL and Alteryx, so that the understanding of SQL eases the transition to Alteryx, and the practice in Alteryx reinforces the understanding of SQL.}

abstract = {In recent years, Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) has become emerging innovation in robotics research and development. Research in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) aims to understand, design, and evaluate robotic systems intended for human use. Robots and humans must communicate for interaction to occur. Human-robot communication can take various forms, but the proximity of the two parties heavily influences these forms.HRI innovations entail learning, designing, and evaluating robotics systems that communicate with people. Robots connecting and speaking with humans are becoming increasingly common at home, customer service, education, and healthcare. Despite the fact that there are now many robotic instruments that teach students how to learn various subjects and activities, efficient integration of the prediction model is still under development. Therefore, this research introduces a student engagement prediction model using HRI (SEPM-HRI) in higher education. This model uses the supervised learning algorithm for student engagement prediction. The experimental results show that the proposed model can implement in a real-time scenario with the expected prediction accuracy of 98.78%. The experimental results show that the proposed SEPM-HRImodel enhances an accuracy ratio of 98.78%, interaction ratio of 95.62%, prediction ratio of 96.35%, a learning rate of 94.26%, a student engagement ratio of 93.14%, and a student participation ratio of 92.86%. This model gives the mean square error rate of 30.21% compared to other existing approaches.}

An online survey, where participants were sent one of three different cases (Case A related to first-generation students, Case B, an archetypical student, Case C, students with a learning disability), and 18 identical questions across all three cases. The survey was distributed among 1773 teachers. Based on the responses of 194 university teachers, we identify differences related to responsibility, equity, and knowledge about artificial intelligence. Our quantitative data exhibited that in Case A and Case C, the respondents ranked to a higher degree that universities should use artificial intelligence tools and systems to achieve equitable outcomes. Data revealed no statistically significant associations among the respondents with regard to background variables in Case A. However, Case B and Case C disclosed statistically significant associations concerning gender, age, faculty, and academic position among the participants. Moreover, we identify teachers’ fears and scepticism about artificial intelligence in higher education, concerns about fairness and responsibility, and lack of knowledge about artificial intelligence and resources to engage with artificial intelligence in teaching practices.}

Using cluster analysis, categories were identified regarding when and how often online flipped lessons were accessed: (i) before class, (ii) after class and before a weekly exam, and (iii) after the weekly exam but before an assignment. Gender and the average number of minutes the lessons were accessed before each time period were also considered. Findings indicated that there was sustained access to flipped materials throughout the semester for all students. In addition to accessing online lessons prior to class, students also accessed online lessons prior to weekly exams and project submission deadlines, indicating the value of such material for revision. Interestingly, two clusters of non-native English-speakers were identified where one group accessed the material more often than native students, and the second group accessed the material less frequently than the native English-speaking students.}

Nevertheless, lack of feedback support has caused students to struggle in developing their reflective thinking skills. Despite the abundance of literature related to feedback practices, the notion of how feedback should be tailored and creatively delivered requires further research. Hence, this study aims to ascertain about how the provision of specific feedback through questioning approach can trigger specific reflective thinking skills using innovative analytical analysis technique, that is, association rules mining. An explorative case study qualitative design was employed and the study was conducted for 14 weeks. Six case-based activities that reflect real-world scenarios were created for students to critically discuss and solve in the blogging environment. Association rules data mining technique was utilised on qualitative data of reflections on both course and individual blogs, to model how feedback through questioning may influence the direction of reflective thinking skills. The findings revealed 16 important association rules and from that only Limited Focal, Open Focal, Brainstorming and Application types of feedback were discovered to lead to important reflective thinking skills development. It was also found that students’ reflective discussion cannot simply move beyond reportive/descriptive thinking and decision-making, despite being pressed by higher level feedback. The overall findings of this study also have implications towards parties like students, instructors, and syllabus and materials designers in terms of how to creatively develop and teach reflective thinking skills via the feedback through questioning approach in educational blogging environments.}

Following a pre-usage and post-usage experimental design based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology model and the Structural Equation Modelling, we observed how, within four courses (839 participants in the academic year 2019–20, of which 347 participants answered both a pre- and post-usage questionnaire), the students' acceptance changed overtime. Our findings revealed a disconfirmation effect in the acceptance of the early warning system, namely, a difference between expectations surrounding the technology pre- and post-usage, and shed light on the ways artificial intelligence systems should be integrated within Higher Education virtual classrooms.}

The proposed test method, for the first time, uses the simulation files marking for individualised evaluation purposes. The methodology has successfully been implemented in practice for three modules including Process Simulation (CE2105), Advanced Process Simulation (CE4023), and Process Computation (CE3021) at Aston University (UK) over three academic years, from 2016 to 2019. The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been evaluated using several factors, including final marks, consistency multiple academic years, and mark distribution. In contrast to the common teamwork assessments, individualised feedback became possible. While ASPEN has been used for CE4023 and CE2105 tests, MATLAB has been applied as the computation platform for CE3021 module. This reveals the applicability of different software in proposed methodology. The number of students in the cohorts studied was from 52 to 204, demonstrating the applicability of the method for various cohort sizes. Even though the methodology has been demonstrated based on the chemical engineering discipline modules, it allows digitalising the delivery and assessment of a wide range of simulation techniques in many disciplines.}

The estimated effect size (Hedge's g) was positive, although not significantly different from zero and the confidence interval [-0.13, 0.25], suggesting that overall differences between blended and conventional classroom learning are small, and, at best, very small negative or moderate positive effects are plausible. This means that despite a reduction in classroom time between 30 and 79 per cent, equivalent learning outcomes were found. Consequently, blended learning with reduced classroom time is not systematically more or less effective than conventional classroom learning.}

Machine learning approaches are designed to speed up the learning process without sacrificing accuracy. The dynamics of teaching and learning have shifted since the introduction of modern technological tools. The educational system as a whole has changed and developed over time. These days, people can get an education outside of the classroom as well, thanks to the proliferation of online courses and resources. Everyone's professional life begins with their education. By analyzing past data, artificial intelligence methods can resolve existing problems. When applied properly, artificial intelligence can be a highly efficient method for solving problems with a predictable and repeatable solution space. The learner's personality can be predicted based on a number of factors using machine learning approaches. This article examines how AI may improve digital learning in education management systems to sustain the education ecosystem. AI in education improves student results, learning experiences, and administrative processes. This study discusses AI applications in education management systems and associated problems and opportunities. We also explore ethical issues and the roadmap for using AI to improve education. Educational institutions can provide individualized curriculum for students based on their unique personalities and areas of interest.

Traditionally, cognitive diagnostic models (CDMs) have evolved from manually designed probabilistic graphical models to sophisticated automated learning models employing neural networks. Despite their enhanced fitting capabilities, contemporary neuro-cognitive diagnostic models frequently overlook critical process information from students and suffer from reduced interpretability. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a neuro-cognitive diagnostic model that integrates multidimensional features (MFNCD) by incorporating students’ response time as process information. This approach facilitates the simultaneous modeling of students’ response accuracy and response speed using neural networks, thereby enhancing both the fitting capability and precision of the method. Furthermore, a multi-channel attention mechanism is employed to effectively capture the complex interactions between students and exercise characteristics, simulating the process of students answering questions and thereby improving the model's interpretability. Validated on four diverse datasets, MFNCD model demonstrates superior accuracy compared to other state-of-the-art (SOAT) baseline models. Additionally, our experiments confirm significant correlations between cognitive attributes, revealing interesting educational patterns, such as a positive correlation between speed and ability, and between ability and accuracy. These findings provide deeper insights into learning patterns that incorporate multidimensional features and suggest potential pathways for targeted educational interventions.}

As a popular instant message software in China, WeChat has been commonly adopted for supporting academic group discussions. Many studies have explored how teacher facilitation affects students' learning performance in the synchronous or asynchronous discussion settings. However, the conclusions are not consistent and there is relative less research about the effects of teacher role on student engagement in the context of online discussion using the semi-synchronous tool-WeChat. This study began by identifying three dimensions of student engagement: behavioral engagement, cognitive engagement, and emotional engagement. A quasi-experiment was then conducted to compare student engagement among experiment groups (with teacher facilitation) and control groups (without teacher facilitation). A total of 46 college students were divided into eight groups and asked to discuss two specific topic tasks. To evaluate participants' behavioral and cognitive engagement, this study used a more objective data analysis method by applying content analysis rather than only based on surveys. Participants were required to complete a questionnaire to report their emotional engagement. The results show the behavioral and cognitive engagement of the experimental group with teacher facilitation were significantly higher than that of the control group without teacher facilitation. However, there was no significant effect of teacher facilitation on participants’ emotional engagement in the experimental group. It is also found that the emerging student leaders show similar positive effects of teacher facilitation towards improving behavioral and cognitive engagement. Future studies about the moderating effects of teaching experience and student leaders are also needed.}

abstract = {Chatbots provide unique interactions with compatible learning system features, improving the limitations of current learning systems. Educational chatbots are seen as the future of technology integration in the field of education. The success and usefulness of chatbots in the educational setting are highly dependent on teachers' beliefs regarding their efficacy, yet most research focuses on the effects on students' learning. Only a few studies have investigated teachers’ beliefs regarding the use of chatbots, which is considered an important issue. Owning to teachers' beliefs having been transformed from their pre-service teacher training, this study used quantitative (i.e., questionnaires), qualitative (i.e., interview), and evidence-based (i.e., behavioral analysis) methods to investigate pre-service teachers' learning perceptions and intentions about using chatbots for learning during their training phases. The results of this study revealed that learning perceptions did not reflect pre-service teachers' propensity to use chatbots, but the behavioral analysis uncovered some specific intentions for using chatbots. We further discuss these findings to provide recommendations for the future development of chatbots use in education.}

To address the gap, this paper provides an overview of qualitative methods used to assess students' intercultural competence in higher education research. Based on 34 studies, 25 qualitative assessment methods have been identified and captured in a newly-developed typology. Results show that (1) the majority of qualitative methods to assess intercultural competence were writing-based and ‘expressive’ in nature; (2) the assessment results were mainly analysed in a ‘thematic’ or ‘scalar’ manner; and (3) very little assessment took place among STEM majors. These results are further discussed and problematized to provide implications for developing and assessing intercultural competence in higher education research and curriculum.}

Although not formally recognised as an educational model, the first steps towards embracing crowdsourcing as a form of formal learning and teaching have recently emerged. Before taking a dramatic step forward, it should be estimated whether it is feasible, sustainable and socially responsible. A nice initiative, which intends to set a groundwork for responsible research and innovation and actively implement crowdsourcing for language learning of all citizens regardless of their diversified social, educational, and linguistic backgrounds is enetCollect. In order to achieve these goals, a sound framework that embraces the ethical and legal considerations should be established. The framework is intended for all the current and prospective creators of crowd-oriented educational systems. It incorporates the ethical issues affecting the three stakeholders: collaborative content creators, prospective users, as well as the institutions intending to implement the approach for educational purposes. The proposed framework offers a practical solution intending to overcome the revealed barriers, which might increase the risk of compromising its main educational goals. If carefully designed and implemented, crowdsourcing might become a very helpful, and at the same time, a very reliable educational model.}

When concurrency is added to a course covering object-based programming, five related design principles for meeting these, sometimes conflicting, requirements are: (a) analogies, worked examples, and assignments are all implementations of simulations of moving physical objects, (b) the user-interface components of the simulations are created automatically or implemented manually using the MVC design pattern, (c) assignment implementations are layered to follow the logical dependence among concepts, (d) the concurrency aspects of the functional components of the simulations are implemented using reusable loop and design patterns, and (e) students can experiment with concurrency extensions to implementations of worked examples and assignments. We followed these principles in multiple course offerings that added concurrency to two different courses on object-based programming. Our data-based evaluation of these offerings, using new inferencing algorithms, analyzed the number of posts and contributions to class discussion forums; the number of entries in class participation diaries; the number of times an automated test is run before it passes; and the percentage of attempts to implement different aspects of concurrency that yield no success. The results show that adding thread execution and creation, synchronization, and coordination has little or no significant effect on measures of engagement, learning, and struggle.}

This article examines the perspectives of 185 undergraduate students enrolled in a fourth-semester French multiliteracies course at a university in the Southwestern United States. Through the theory and pedagogy of multiliteracies, this design-based implementation research investigates how students traversed multimodal composing in 376 video reflections and 265 digital multimodal projects. These data, along with interviews from 10 focal students, are analyzed qualitatively through multimodal transcription, open, axial, and selective coding to illuminate student perceptions. Findings demonstrate how the multimodal projects and the multiliteracies curricula provided students an avenue to develop critical literacy, a growth mindset, and a sense of community. Analysis additionally revealed that students perceived spontaneous speaking and time constraints as tensions in the multiliteracies curriculum. These findings hold implications for designing and scaffolding L2 multiliteracies courses throughout the scope and sequence of university language courses.}

This study adapted the hedonic-motivation system adoption model to identify high achievers' perceived attitudes, flow experience, programming intentions and perceived teacher support. With a response rate of 72%, 54 primary schools participated in the study. A survey was conducted and four hundred and thirty-two students were included in the moderated mediation analysis. The results showed that high achievers' attitudes towards programming positively related to their flow experience, which further positively associated with their programming intentions. In addition, teacher support moderated the relationship between high achievers’ attitudes and their flow experience; such that when teacher support increased, the flow experience was weaker for those with comparatively higher positive attitudes. The practical implications of the findings and future research directions are discussed.}

It is however challenging to select the exercises with reasonable difficulty for students as they have different learning status and the size of exercise bank is quite large. The classic collaborative filtering (CF) based recommendation methods rely heavily on the similarities among students or exercises, leading to recommend exercises with mismatched difficulty. This paper proposes a novel exercise recommendation method, which uses Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to predict the coverage of knowledge concepts, and uses Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT) to predict students’ mastery level of knowledge concepts based on the student’s exercise answer records. The predictive results are utilized to filter the exercises; therefore, a subset of exercise bank is generated. As such, a complete list of recommended exercises can be obtained by solving an optimization problem. Extensive experimental studies show that our proposed approach has advantages over some existing baseline methods, not only in terms of the evaluation of difficulty of recommended exercises, but also the diversity and novelty of the recommendation lists.}

It was hypothesized that participants would judge less well-established items more slowly, and conversely that entrenched items, whether target-like or not, would be judged more quickly. 20 learners at two proficiency levels judged audio recordings of themselves reformulating errors they had made in small-group conversations. Items had been categorized according to reformulation accuracy and fluency, and the analysis investigated whether judgment accuracy and speed mirrored these categories. Results indicate clear parallels in reformulation and judgment accuracy, but a weak relationship between fluency of production and recognition. The categorization of errors occurring in both production and recognition, perhaps representing “attempts” at meaning-making (Edge, 1989; Willis, 2003), is proposed as the focus of future pedagogical research investigation. To this end, a pedagogical application of the self-judgment methodology is described.}

abstract = {Background and purpose
Journal article critiques are frequently used to teach literature evaluation to pharmacy students. Peer review is one method to improve students' competency regarding journal article critiques. The objective of this manuscript is to describe implementation of electronic peer review of journal article critique drafts and explore students' intrinsic motivation to participate in the peer-review process. Influence of students' motivation to participate in peer review on their self-competence regarding journal article critiques was also explored.
Educational activity and setting
Second-year pharmacy students participated in three in-class, electronic, anonymous peer-review sessions for written journal article critique drafts. Students were invited to complete a 16-item survey instrument based on self-determination theory. Modified Intrinsic Motivation Inventory and Perceived Competence Scales assessed student interest in and perceived value of the peer-review sessions and their self-competence regarding journal article critiques.
Findings
The survey response rate was 99% (146/148). Based on a Likert scale of 1 (not at all true) to 7 (very true), students demonstrated moderate interest in the peer-review sessions (M = 3.86), viewed them as valuable (M = 5.25), and had a moderate level of self-competence regarding journal article critiques (M = 3.74). Additionally, interest and perceived value of the peer-review sessions significantly influenced self-competence in completing journal article critiques.
Summary
An anonymous, electronic peer-review system provides an efficient method for in-class peer review of draft assignments. Implementing strategies to increase student interest in peer review may increase their motivation for participation and ultimately improve self-competence regarding literature evaluation.}

Text processing models continue progressing with the rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools and Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms. Especially after breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLM), there is immense potential to automate rapid assessment and feedback of text-based responses in education. This systematic review adopts a scientific and reproducible literature search strategy based on the PRISMA process using explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria to study text-based automatic assessment systems in post-secondary education, screening 838 papers and synthesizing 93 studies. To understand how text-based automatic assessment systems have been developed and applied in education in recent years, three research questions are considered: 1) What types of automated assessment systems can be identified using input, output, and processing framework? 2) What are the educational focus and research motivations of studies with automated assessment systems? 3) What are the reported research outcomes in automated assessment systems and the next steps for educational applications? All included studies are summarized and categorized according to a proposed comprehensive framework, including the input and output of the system, research motivation, and research outcomes, aiming to answer the research questions accordingly. Additionally, the typical studies of automated assessment systems, research methods, and application domains in these studies are investigated and summarized. This systematic review provides an overview of recent educational applications of text-based assessment systems for understanding the latest AI/NLP developments assisting in text-based assessments in higher education. Findings will particularly benefit researchers and educators incorporating LLMs such as ChatGPT into their educational activities.}

The study aimed to enhance knowledge in the field and added to the debates on the implications of 4IR on the TVET programme in South Africa. Through the Human Capital Theory (HCT) lens, the study sought to comprehend how to match the demands of 4IR with the TVET programme in South Africa. The study's objectives were to investigate the implications of the 4IR on the TVET programme and to determine how the TVET programme can appropriately prepare graduates in South Africa for the workplace. A constructivist paradigm sheltered the study through a qualitative approach and a phenomenological design. Purposive sampling was applied to select eight participants, comprising six TVET college lecturers, a TVET college placement manager, and a Department of Higher Education and Training (DHET) senior official. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to gain rich and meaningful responses from respondents. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, coded, themed, and analysed through thematic analysis with the aid of Atlas. Ti. The study's results reveal various implications for the TVET programme. Implications include updating TVET curricula and syllabi, promoting the TVET sector and labour industry collaboration, accepting 4IR technology as a learning tool, and increasing TVET lecturer capacity. The skills that were identified as essential for various industries in the 4IR era include creativity, computer skills, and problem-solving skills, which are cross-functional. These findings contribute to the theoretical knowledge of how the TVET programme can be positioned in the context of the 4IR. The study will assist stakeholders such as the labour market, quality assurance public entities, qualifications authorities, researchers, economic actors, and the TVET sector to sufficiently equip TVET graduates for the workplace in the 4IR era.}

The analysis of the students' outputs and their responses to a survey, suggest that most of the students' experience of the team innovation project was positive and the project enabled them to socially construct their knowledge of accounting and to develop their team innovation competence. This study contributes towards bridging the gap between professional education and practice and provides a basis for instructors to further develop students’ team innovation competence, even in disciplines not typically characterized as being innovative.}

abstract = {While research has highlighted the importance of translanguaging for emergent multilingual learners (EMLs), very few studies have focused on teacher candidates (TCs)’ knowledge of translanguaging and how they implement the pedagogy. Using ethnographic methods and multimodal conversation analysis, this study examined how an English as an Additional Language (EAL) TC's knowledge of translanguaging evolved and how she bridged theory to practice in a field-based setting. The participant was a multilingual speaker who did not speak her EMLs' home languages. Data sources included: 1) the participant's course assessments, 2) a reflection, and 3) transcripts of a video classroom observation. The findings revealed her strong stance and ability to use a variety of strategies to create a translanguaging space, as a result of her training. We recommend teachers to enrich their pedagogical repertoire by understanding the affordances of a diverse range of multilingual, multimodal, and multi-sensory resources to effectively facilitate the teaching and learning processes. We also advise teacher educators to be intentional in course design, offering opportunities for TCs to reflect and connect their second language acquisition knowledge with pedagogical translanguaging in order to discover their own ways to create a translanguaging space for EMLs.}

abstract = {The traditional education model is undergoing tremendous changes, and network education has gradually developed and matured. This paper first gives an overview of the development history of the clarinet and the structure of the clarinet and then starts with the performance of the clarinet. This paper analyses and solves the situations that students are prone to encounter in teaching and expresses some opinions on the teaching of performance methods; also gives a brief overview of the psychology of going on stage. Combined with the above, some discussions are made on the teaching of performance methods. Performance requires not only skills but also music. Performance summarizes the characteristics and styles of music in various periods from the classical period to the century, and then discusses how the performer forms his performance style; the performance style is the re-creation and re-creation of the performer based on being loyal to the author's intention. This article compares and studies the performance of the clarinet before the 20th century and the performance of the clarinet today, and deeply explores the reasons why the clarinet performance method has formed the current performance method after a long evolution. The experimental results prove that virtual reality technology has made positive attempts and breakthroughs in the field of clarinet music art teaching. It has created an environment of “self-learning”, and the traditional learning method of “teaching to promote learning” has been replaced by learners through their learning. Interaction with the information environment to obtain a new learning method of knowledge and skills, the optimized local matrix decomposition recommendation algorithm can greatly improve problems such as expensive musical instruments and lessons, scarce teachers, and lack of facilities, making the traditional clarinet Music arts teaching more diverse.}

abstract = {Mathematics remedial instruction is a mathematics education topic worthy of attention; therefore, studying how to effectively implement remedial instruction is essential. A Grade 12 calculus course was used as a case study for exploring the effects of information and communication technology (ICT)-integrated mathematics remedial instruction and factors affecting students' intention to use. A within-group design was adopted to examine whether students' grades on the same type of question in a posttest were significantly higher than in a pretest using a paired samples t-test. Results showed that when ICT-integrated mathematics remedial instruction was not implemented, students' scores in the posttest were not significantly higher; however, after implementing ICT-integrated mathematics remedial instruction, the grades in the posttest were significantly higher. Regarding students' intention to use ICT-integrated mathematics remedial instruction, the research model was developed from the technology acceptance model. This study analyzed data collected from questionnaires using the partial-least-squares structural equation modeling multivariate data analysis method. The results indicated that (1) perceived usefulness significantly affected attitude toward use and behavioral intention to use; (2) attitude toward use significantly affected behavioral intention to use; and (3) attitude toward use exhibited significant mediating effects between perceived usefulness and behavioral intention to use, indicating that perceived usefulness primarily affected students’ behavioral intention to use through attitude toward use. The results may facilitate the application of technology to implement mathematics remedial instruction.}

The adaptability of an e-learning course is a challenging task that requires appropriate tools and a well-thought-out architecture. The solution presented in this article is based on the concept of information imprecision and fuzzy control. The proposed fuzzy controller, based on an expert rule base calculates the student's activity in the course in order to determine the questions in tests at the end of successive parts of the course. The solution proposed was implemented in an e-learning Applications of Fuzzy Sets course, which was part of an Artificial Intelligence class. The proposed system successfully adapts the course content to the student's learning style. The article highlights the potential of fuzzy controllers in adaptive e-learning systems. The use of fuzzy controllers makes it possible to take into account the imprecision of information, enabling better handling of uncertainty and variability in the student's learning style.}

abstract = {Mastery assessments are used in many digital learning environments to control learning progression and support low-achieving students relearning important content. But research on personalized feedback following a mastery assessment is scarce and yielded ambiguous effects. Therefore, this study seeks to contribute to this area of research by investigating the effect of two different feedback messages in short online courses for German and English language grammar and spelling in secondary classrooms (grades 6–10). The study compares a reward-based feedback message to a self-referenced feedback message. The reward-based message indicates if the learner reaches the mastery criterion and how many points the learning app awarded for completing the test. The self-referenced feedback message applies motivation theory to strengthen students' internal attribution of causes for the test performance. The web-app MasteryX (www.masteryx.de) randomly assigned students to either the reward-based or the self-referenced feedback message. The study sampled 620 students (309 female, 311 male) in 53 classrooms from 27 secondary schools. It analyzed the effect of the two types of feedback messages on the level of test-retest-sequences (n = 2450). Results indicate small though significant positive effects of the self-referenced feedback message on subsequent learning behavior (reading elaborated item feedback, training behavior). However, a multilevel regression model showed small to medium effects of the reward-based feedback message on the higher course levels' follow-up mastery assessment score. The findings emphasize the complexity of designing personalized feedback strategies in online learning environments with mastery assessments.}

Moodle quizzes offer a wide variety of possibilities for the development of formative writing assessment. This is due to the impressive repertoire of choices with regard to specific tasks and to quiz design options available in Moodle. The key strength of Moodle quizzes, as used for formative assessment, is in supporting a sustained engagement with learning and offering multi-layered tutor feedback functionalities. However, Moodle quizzes come short of accommodating some of the essential features of formative writing assessment, such as peer review/feedback and a dialogic nature of student-tutor interactions. While the development of Moodle quizzes may require time and effort, in particular as related to navigating quiz design settings and understanding Moodle-specific and often counterintuitive language use, Moodle quizzes can prove valuable not only for formative assessment of academic writing, but also for giving reassurance to students that writing provision offered to them at universities is tailored to their specific needs and academic aspirations.}

abstract = {This article presents institutional case studies of technology use in language and literacy instruction at two rural high schools based on almost two months of classroom observations as well as interviews with teachers, administrators, and students. The first school presented faced a number of funding issues and clearly lacked in terms of access—the teachers regularly expressed frustration with district leadership and lamented their ability to have students do more computer-based literacy work. The second school presented had a very different issue—through a series of grants, they had secured computers for every student in their English classes but teachers had varying level of training on how to incorporate them in learning and consequently, the computers were often used in reductive ways. This research provides a perspective that shows the limitations of large-scale comparisons, emphasizing how local contextual factors (such as school leadership and teacher training) can shape both access and use. It also shows how access is only one piece of the picture—without sufficient teacher training and support, available technology may help perpetuate reductive educational practices in language and literacy instruction .}

abstract = {Over the last few decades, there has been growing interest in artificial intelligence (AI) and how to apply it effectively in the educational process. The behavioural intention and attitudes of teachers play an important role in this regard. The technology acceptance model (TAM) has been shown to be effective in predicting factors that may positively or negatively influence behavioural intentions to use technology. The current study therefore aims to use this model to reveal teachers’ perceptions of the factors that influence the use of AI applications in science education. This research uses the descriptive method where a 6-dimensional scale is designed based on the components of the TAM model and then applied to a sample of 83 science teachers in Abu Dhabi. The results show a high acceptability of the use of AI in the classroom by science teachers, with positive correlations to self-efficacy, ease of use, expected benefits, attitudes, and behavioural intentions. However, anxiety and stress do not significantly affect other factors. Regarding the predictive power of research models, the combined factors expected benefits, ease of use, and attitude toward AI applications can predict 71.4% of future behavioural changes related to the use of AI applications in science teaching. This study finds no statistically significant differences in teacher responses based on the variables gender, teaching experience, and qualifications regarding teachers’ behavioural intentions to actually use AI in science teaching.}

Data from students' mid-term and end-of-term questionnaires, as well as teachers' journals, were collected in the Spring, and follow-up teacher interviews were carried out in Fall 2020. Results indicate that students' overall stress levels diminished from beginning to end of the academic term but that individual experiences were extremely varied. While some students enjoyed the increased autonomy and self-paced learning opportunities of the online format, others felt distressed in this less directed modality and emphasized the negative effect of reduced social interactions on their levels of engagement. Only few students mentioned technological difficulties as a central challenge in their learning process, but many believed that they had learned less than in traditional face-to-face courses. Instructors’ views differed in this respect, as they considered that the reduced group-size of synchronous Zoom sessions allowed them to hear more of each student, which they saw as evidence of increased student talk as compared to the usual whole-class face-to-face sessions. This more intimate virtual set-up also increased a sense of proximity between teachers and students.}
