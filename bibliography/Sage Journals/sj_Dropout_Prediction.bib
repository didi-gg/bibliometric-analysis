abstract = {This study aimed to compare key predictors of academic resilience in the distinctive socio-cultural contexts of South Korea and the United States, employing a machine-learning-based random forest technique. Using PISA 2018 data, we focused on students in the bottom 25% of family socioeconomic status, totaling 1,654 in South Korea and 1,175 in the US. The results showed that individual factors, such as meta-cognition, joy of reading, self-concept of reading, and work mastery, were ranked highly in both countries. On the other hand, self-efficacy and students’ expectation of higher education were specific to Korea, while fixed mindset and meaning in life were specific to the US. Based on these findings, this study highlighted the need for culturally responsive policies to nurture academic resilience among disadvantaged youth.}

abstract = {As the economic landscape changes, a college degree has become increasingly necessary for securing employment in an information-based society. Student engagement is an important factor in predicting and preventing high school dropout, and improving student outcomes. Although the relationship between secondary school engagement and high school completion is well supported in existing research, the relationship between secondary school engagement and postsecondary enrollment and persistence is unclear. In this study, we examined whether students’ engagement in high school predicts postsecondary matriculation and persistence in the first year after accounting for demographic and school-level variables. Results indicated secondary student engagement does predict postsecondary enrollment and persistence beyond academic and behavioral variables. Consistent with research among secondary students, the Future Goals and Aspirations Scale of the Student Engagement Instrument was the strongest engagement predictor. Results have implications for early warning systems and college retention effort.}

However, associations between these variables have been explored separately. Using PLS-SEM, the present study explored a multivariate model in which these variables interplay to predict affective symptoms. A sample of 403 students between ages 18 and 29 years from 55 Colombian institutions of higher education participated by completing Zung depression and anxiety scales, the Multidimensional Perfectionism Scale, the Inventory of Academic Stress, the Penn State Worry Questionnaire, and the Ruminative Responses Scale. Results indicate a positive relationship between perfectionism and academic stress, and a mediation effect of worry and rumination in the relationship between academic stress and anxiety and depressive symptoms. Findings provide evidence of a novel model that precedes the design of target prevention and intervention programs pointing to reduce the risk of affective disorders and its associated negative consequence.}

abstract = {School attendance and absenteeism are critical targets of educational policies and practices that often depend heavily on aggregated attendance/absenteeism data. School attendance/absenteeism data in aggregated form, in addition to having suspect quality and utility, minimizes individual student variation, distorts detailed and multilevel modeling, and obscures underlying causes and disparities of absenteeism. Recent advances in data analytics/mining and modeling may assist researchers and other stakeholders by evaluating large-scale data sets in more targeted ways to identify key root causes and patterns of school absenteeism in a particular community, school, or group of students. This would allow for more accurate educational policies tailored to unique local conditions and student/family circumstances. This article provides a summary of recent algorithm- and model-based efforts in this regard. Algorithm-based efforts include classification and regression tree analysis, ensemble analysis, support vector machines, receiver operating characteristic analysis, and random forests. Model-based efforts include multilevel modeling, structural equation modeling, latent class analysis, and meta-analytic modeling. We then illustrate how these efforts can enhance a full and nuanced understanding of the root, interconnected causes of absenteeism, improve early warning systems, and assist multi-tiered systems of support interventions for absenteeism.}

Specifically, this approach converts the predicted output from the former weeks into meaningful probabilities to infer the predictions in the current week for maintaining the consecutiveness among learning activities. To demonstrate the efficacy of our model in identifying at-risk students, we compare the weekly AUCs and averaged performance (i.e., accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score) over each course with the baseline models (i.e., Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Decision Tree), respectively. Furthermore, we adopt a Top-K metric to examine the number of at-risk students that the model is able to identify with high precision during each week. Finally, the model output is interpreted through a model-agnostic interpretation approach to support instructors to make informed recommendations for students’ learning. The experimental results demonstrate the capability and interpretability of our model in identifying at-risk students in online learning settings. In addition to that our work also provides significant implications in building accountable machine learning pipelines that can be used to automatically generated individualized learning interventions while considering fairness between different learning groups.}

Thus, this study combined machine learning with traditional statistics to identify the most important predictors and to interpret their effects on proficiency in the PISA 2018 mathematics, science, and reading tests. Predictors encompassed a wide range of variables, sociodemographic characteristics, teaching and learning processes, and non-cognitive skills. The outcome of the present study was proficiency in mathematics, science, and reading. PISA proficiency levels were grouped into “low proficiency” and “proficient” categories, using a classification system commonly employed in PISA reports. Using random forest analysis, a machine learning method, I compared the importance of predictors for proficiency in mathematics, science, and reading. I then adjusted multilevel logistic regression analyses to investigate the relationship between the top predictors and the outcomes. Among the top predictors for the three outcomes identified, annual household income, parents’ highest occupational status, and early childhood education and care were positively associated with proficiency in mathematics, science, and reading, while grade repetition and additional instruction were negatively associated with these outcomes. These findings urge Brazilian policymakers and educators to prioritize initiatives that strengthen early childhood programs, minimize grade repetition, and promote effective learning strategies.}

abstract = {Purpose: In an era of unprecedented student measurement and emphasis on data-driven educational decision making, the full potential for using data to target resources to students has yet to be realized. This study explores the utility of machine-learning techniques with large-scale administrative data to identify student dropout risk. Research Methods: Using longitudinal student records data from the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction, this article assesses modern prediction techniques, with a focus on tree-based classification methods and support vector machines. These methods incorporate 74 predictors measures from Grades 3 through 8, including academic achievement, behavioral indicators, and socioeconomic and demographic characteristics. Findings: Two of the assessed classification algorithms predict high school graduation and dropping out correctly for more than 90% of an out-of-sample student cohort. Findings reveal a shift toward lower dropout incidence in regions hit hardest by the economic recession of 2008, especially for male students. Implications for Research and Practice: Machine-learning procedures, as demonstrated in this study, offer promise for allowing administrators to reliably identify students at risk of dropping out of school so as to provide targeted, intensive programs at the lowest possible cost.}

We consider 160 higher education institutions with an average of 671 bachelor study programs per year from 2013 to 2018. Using several econometric models (pooled ordinary least square, fixed effect model, and random effect model), we regress student dropout rate on four categories of indicators: student characteristics, and institutional, contextual, and external factors. The estimation results suggest that the institutional characteristics have a significant impact on dropouts. The findings show that student–staff ratio has a positive influence on student dropout. We also find a negative association between staff quality and dropout rate. In addition, the analysis reveals the importance of contextual factors such as university accommodation in helping students to complete university education. Finally, regression also indicates a significant and positive interaction between unemployment rate and the dropout rat.}

However, the high attrition rates in MOOCs have often been cited as a scale-efficacy tradeoff. Traditional educational approaches are usually unable to identify such large-scale number of at-risk students in danger of dropping out in time to support effective intervention design. While building dropout prediction models using learning analytics are promising in informing intervention design for these at-risk students, results of the current prediction model construction methods do not enable personalized intervention for these students. In this study, we take an initial step to optimize the dropout prediction model performance toward intervention personalization for at-risk students in MOOCs. Specifically, based on a temporal prediction mechanism, this study proposes to use the deep learning algorithm to construct the dropout prediction model and further produce the predicted individual student dropout probability. By taking advantage of the power of deep learning, this approach not only constructs more accurate dropout prediction models compared with baseline algorithms but also comes up with an approach to personalize and prioritize intervention for at-risk students in MOOCs through using individual drop out probabilities. The findings from this study and implications are then discussed.}

As AI technologies are new to K-12 school curriculum, the research on AI for K-12 classrooms is under explored. In this study, the current state of AI integration in school education and risks associated with it were explored. The study using a systematic review method attempted to explore the findings, observations, and results of recent research regarding the possible risk factors of AI integration in K-12 education. At initial search using predefined key terms, 390 articles were recorded. Using inclusion and exclusion criteria, 71 articles covering 34 journals and other publications were selected for final analysis. Selected 71 articles reported that AI innovation incorporation into K-12 education is associated with certain risks and challenges. Through a systematic review technique, we categorized them into major 6 risk areas namely Privacy and Autonomy Risks, AI Biases, Accuracy and Functional Risks, Deepfakes and FATE Risks, Social Knowledge and Skill Building Risks, and Risk in Shifting Teacher’s Role. The study also explored these risk areas to provide an overview of how these are connected with teaching and learning process of K-12 education.}

abstract = {Background/Context Amidst the complex and fast-paced demands in schools and classrooms, identifying what most deserves educators’ attention can pose a challenge. Indicators help focus attention by highlighting key features that signal important outcomes or opportunities to take action or learn. Purpose Informed by multiple literatures, we offer a conceptual framework that elaborates on the connection between an indicator’s development and use. Specifically, the framework proposes that how to develop indicators depends on the answers to several questions about how they will be used: the intended use (why), timing (when), content (on what), and threshold (how much). Research Design To explore this conceptual framework, we present two cases on the construction and use of indicators for continuous improvement in the San Francisco Unified School District. In the first case, we applied statistical process control (SPC) theory to create control charts that visualize district-level outliers on student achievement outcomes to examine potential causes of variation among schools. In the second case, we combined SPC with more basic statistical methods to develop indicators highlighting areas of potential promise across multiple measures and student subgroups within a school. In our exploration of the two case studies, we present the statistical methods applied to construct the indicator, an example of the visualizations created, and descriptions of how central office leaders interpreted and used the results. We document how the intended use informed the indicators’ design, and the ramifications of those decisions for educators’ subsequent use of the indicators for improvement. Conclusions and Recommendations In learning from these cases, we highlight the importance of constructing indicators from the perspective of their intended use and linked with specific conditions and potential actions. This requires including more useful process data in the development of those indicators, as well as more follow-up analysis of the effectiveness of the actions taken based on those indicators, contrasted against alternative actions. We also underscore the importance of developing indicators that distinguish between the need for systemic versus targeted improvement efforts, based on SPC. We believe that combining approaches across disciplines and methodologies holds great promise for the development and use of indicators for continuous improvement in education.}

abstract = {School absenteeism is a major societal problem, with a range of potential adverse long-term consequences. This scoping review aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of the research on school absenteeism in autistic children and adolescents, expose important gaps in the literature, and explore possibilities for future systematic reviews. Five relevant databases were searched systematically from inception to June 2023, yielding a total of 46 eligible reports from 42 separate studies. All studies were conducted in high-income countries, and most were published in the last decade. Three major themes emerged: occurrence, contextual factors, and interventions. The results of large-scale population-based studies clearly suggested that autistic children and adolescents were absent from school more often than their non-autistic peers, which partly was attributable to co-occurring conditions. Bullying also emerged as a potential risk factor. Only a few preliminary studies were available on targeted interventions, emphasizing the need for more robust studies. More research is also needed on the mechanisms leading to and maintaining school absenteeism in this group of learners. Overall, the diversity of research questions, methods, and definitions used in this body of research suggests that systematic reviews with narrow focus on a few key questions may still be premature. Lay abstract Autistic children and teenagers are, on average, absent from school more than their peers. The aim of this review was to provide an overview of the research on absence from school in autistic learners in primary and secondary school, to help guide future research. We sifted through 4632 reports and found 42 studies with a focus on school absence and autism. We looked at how, when, and where the studies were conducted. We also summarized the results and outlined how absence was measured in the studies. Absence from school may lead to problems later in life, like incomplete education and unemployment. It is therefore important to know how common this problem is among autistic learners, what the reasons may be, and what type of support they need. The studies were from high-income countries and were mainly published in the last 10 years. Studies based on school registers from the United States and the United Kingdom clearly showed that children and teenagers with autism had higher risk of school absence than those without autism. Absence was often linked to problems with mental health or additional neurodevelopmental conditions. Several studies also showed that absence in autistic children and adolescents was related to problems in school, like bullying or lack of knowledge about autism. Support programs were only evaluated in a few studies with a small number of study participants. We conclude that more research is needed to better understand why autistic learners are absent and what they need to thrive in schoo.}

abstract = {This study examines deviant identity in relation to youth offending by combining items tapping both self-appraisal and reflected appraisal. In particular, using survey data from 3,446 Korean youth across five waves of the Korea Youth Panel Survey (KYPS), findings from group-based trajectory modeling (GBTM) present four distinct offending groups—a high-rate chronic group, stable non-offending group, adolescence-limited group, and declining group. Then, findings from the multinomial logit model reveal that deviant identity is a robust predictor of offending for subgroups of adolescents involved in offending at any level in comparison to stable non-offenders. Accordingly, this study supports the idea that deviant identity should be considered as a prominent predictor of a variety of types of youth offending.}

abstract = {The assessment of screening accuracy and setting of cut points for a universal screener have traditionally been evaluated using logistic regression analysis. This analytic technique has been frequently used to evaluate the trade-offs in correct classification with misidentification of individuals who are at risk of performing poorly on a later outcome. Although useful statistically, coefficients from a multiple logistic regression can be difficult to explain to practitioners as it pertains to classification decisions. Moreover, classifications based on multivariate assessments are challenging to understand how performance on one assessment compensates for performance on another. The purpose of this article is to demonstrate and compare the use of logistic regression with classification and regression tree (CART) models in the identification of students who are at risk of reading comprehension difficulties. Data consisted of 986 Grade 1 students and 887 Grade 2 students who were administered a screening assessment at the middle of the school year as well as the 10th edition of the Stanford Achievement Test. Results indicated that CART performs comparably with logistic regression and may assist researchers and practitioners in explaining classification rules to parents and educator.}

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Proposed frameworks of college and career readiness include aspects of school climate perceptions and behavioral engagement. School climate initiatives emphasize the importance of healthy learning environments; while behavioral indicators tend to be used to identify students at-risk for disengagement, established early warning systems include few, if any, behavioral indicators. A promising and useful screening mechanism that combines behavioral indicators along with school climate perceptions may enhance identification of adolescents at risk for disengagement, academic failure, and dropout, and may ultimately improve college and career readiness. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between self-reported adolescent perceptions of school climate and extant high school academic and behavioral data to create an index score which could be used as an early warning system for student disengagement. METHODS: To accomplish the stated objective, we employed structural equation modeling to estimate a multiple indicators multiple causes model using a sample of high school students (n = 5039) with and without disabilities. Extant school data included grade point average, attendance, tardies, and office discipline referrals, while school climate was measured using the Georgia Brief School Climate survey. RESULTS: Findings show evidence of a robust Adolescent Behavioral Index when controlled for disability status as those with disabilities are expected to have lower index scores indicating greater risk for school disengagement. CONCLUSION: Implications for research and practice are focused on the Adolescent Behavioral Index as a mechanism for systematic data collection that may underlie early warning systems in high schools specifically when designing college and career readiness interventions for adolescents and when identifying students who may be at risk for disengagement.}

abstract = {Background: Young adults are at elevated risks of hikikomori (severe social withdrawal) under the COVID-19 pandemic, which could lead to psychological distress and suicidal ideation. Aims: The present study aimed to examine the associations among hikikomori, suicide stigma, suicidal ideation, and help-seeking behaviors among young adults in Hong Kong. Method: This study recruited a large sample of 2,022 young adults in Hong Kong via an online survey at the end of 2021. The participants completed the Hikikomori Questionnaire and validated measures on psychological distress, suicide stigma, and suicidal ideation severity and report their help-seeking behaviors. Multivariate analysis of variance was conducted to compare the profiles of the hikikomori groups. Path analysis evaluated the effects of hikikomori and suicide stigma on occurrence and severity of suicidal ideation and their associations with help-seeking behaviors. Results: Hikikomori showed significant and positive indirect effects on prevalence and severity of suicidal ideation via psychological distress. Glorification positively predicted hikikomori and suicidal ideation severity among suicidal persons. Hikikomori was associated with reduced help-seeking. Isolation and suicidal ideation were associated with greater barriers to seek help among the non-help-seekers. Perceived helpfulness of sought help was negatively associated with hikikomori and suicidal ideation among the help-seekers. Conclusions: The present findings demonstrated greater prevalence and severity of suicidal ideation and less help-seeking in young adults with hikikomori. Suicide stigma showed differential associations with hikikomori, suicidal ideation, and help-seeking behaviors.}

abstract = {This article aims to support interpersonal violence (IPV) researchers in promoting diversity and inclusion in their research and scholarship and urges the IPV field to advance a racial equity, anti-oppressive, and justice-driven research agenda. The article discusses a range of factors to consider at each stage of the research process as researchers seek to be inclusive, responsive to diversity concerns, and seek equity. The researcher’s perspective and positionality are discussed and the importance of critical self-examination of one’s position in relation to the research is emphasized. Participatory and collaborative research processes are recommended, to engage with community partners, strengthen the validity of the findings, and help ensure that the research benefits the participants. Examples illustrate ways researchers might support diversity and inclusion with respect to sampling and measurement, cultural validity, and the conceptualization and operationalization of race. Recommendations are offered to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion when analyzing data, interpreting results, and writing up the study. The importance of a strengths-based approach and structural level analysis is emphasized. This article goes beyond discussion of the minimum, “do no harm” standard that researchers should meet in attending to diversity and inclusion in research and urges the pursuit of equity, anti-racism, and justice toward dismantling those structures that perpetuate violence in its many forms. Researchers are encouraged to ask themselves: Where would I situate my research? Is it racist, not racist, or anti-racist? Not all IPV research has the goal of dismantling inequities, but we should aspire that it do so.}
