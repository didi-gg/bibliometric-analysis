abstract = {The present study investigated whether student engagement with different online blended learning activities predicts academic performance as measured via a multiple-choice online exam for an undergraduate cognitive psychology course. Higher completion rates of weekly online quizzes predicted final exam performance. Findings are discussed in relation to using online learning resources to enhance student engagement and performance and learning analytics to identify students in need of further support. Since findings only revealed one significant predictor, more research is required to identify additional factors influencing academic achievement in an online blended learning approach.}

abstract = {This study investigates the effectiveness of machine learning and deep learning models for early prediction of student performance in higher education institutions. Using the Open University Learning Analytics (OULA) dataset, various models, including Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, Neural Network, and Ensemble Model, were employed to predict student performance in three categories: Pass/Fail, Close to Fail, and Close to Pass. The Ensemble Model (EM) consistently outperformed other models, achieving the highest overall F1 measure, precision, recall, and accuracy. These results highlight the potential of data-driven techniques in informing educational stakeholders’ decision-making processes, enabling targeted interventions, and facilitating personalized learning strategies tailored to students’ needs. By identifying at-risk students early in the academic year, institutions can provide additional support to improve academic outcomes and retention rates. The study also discusses practical implications, including the development of pedagogical policies and guidelines based on early predictions, which can help educational institutions maintain strong academic outcomes and enhance their reputation for academic excellence. Future research aims to investigate the impact of individual activities on student performance and explore day-to-day student behaviors, enabling the creation of tailored pedagogical policies and guideline.}

This action research study was aimed at addressing this decline in a higher education institute after undertaking a reflective analysis of the waning usage patterns and taking appropriate initiatives to enhance their usage. The authors have attempted this as participants driving the change. As change agents, the academic management system implementation was advanced to move closer to a stage where the committed use occurred and intended benefits were realised. Several initiatives were introduced to propel this change. The scope of this article was confined to gauging the impact of the trigger factors; memos, and training on the academic management system usage. Their effects were measured by applying learning analytics to various sources of usage and performance data. This further led to analysing the relationship between usage and performance of the stakeholders; students, and faculty.}

Researchers suggest that a visualization dashboard could serve to help educators use LA to improve learning design (LD) practice. We therefore used an educational design approach to develop a pedagogically useful and easy-to-use LA visualization solution to support data-informed LD. We interviewed four staff in a medical degree program at a New Zealand university, designed and piloted a dashboard, and evaluated it through interviews. As a proof-of-concept project, our study showed that educational design research could be meaningfully used to develop a visualization dashboard that is easy-to-use and useful. In particular, the preliminary design principles identified provide implications for practitioners who are seeking to use LA to inform LD. Finally, we reflect on the purpose of visualization dashboards in relation to the literature and identify areas for future developments.}

With the help of wearable technologies, an increasing number of scholars have a strong interest in studying the associations between student data and learning outcomes in different learning environments. This systematic review examines 120 articles published between 2011 and 2021, exploring current research on learning analytics based on wearable devices in detail from both descriptive and content analysis. The descriptive analysis reviewed the included literature in five dimensions: publication times of the reviewed literature, wearable devices and data types used in studies, stakeholders, objectives, and methods involved in the analysis procedure. The content analysis aims to examine the literature covered in terms of three categorical domains of educational objectives: cognitive, affective, and behavioral, to investigate the practical applications and potential issues of learning analytics based on wearable devices. After that, based on the overall research content of the reviewed literature, a framework for learning analytics based on wearable devices is present, and its application process is summarized and analyzed for the reference of related researchers. At last, we summarize the limitations of existing studies and present several recommendations to further promote research and development in this field.}

New fields have emerged which aim to use this data to identify interventions that could help the learners become efficient and effective in their learning. However, these systems have to follow user-centered design principles to ensure that the system is usable and the data is of high quality. Human factors literature is limited on the topics regarding Educational Data Mining (EDM) and Learning Analytics (LA). To develop improved educational systems, it is important for human factors engineers to be exposed to these data-oriented fields. This paper aims to provide a brief introduction to the fields of EDM and LA, discuss data visualization and dashboards that are used to convey results to learners, and finally to identify where human factors can aid other fields.}

This study predicts student engagement at an early phase of a Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) course by analyzing data collected from consecutive years. The prediction model is developed using machine learning techniques applied to a subset of Open University Learning Analytics Dataset, provided by Open University (OU), Britain. The investigated data belongs to 7,775 students who attended social science courses for consecutive assessment years. The experiments are conducted with a reduced feature set to predict whether the students are highly or lowly engaged in the courses. The attributes indicating students’ interaction with the VLE, their scores, and final results are the most contributing variables for the predictive analysis. Based on these variables, a reduced feature vector is constructed. The baseline used in the study is the linear regression model. The model’s best results showed 95% accurate, 95% precise, and 98% relevant results with the Random Forest classification algorithm. Early prediction’s relevant features are a subset of click activities, which provided a functional interface between the students and the VL.}

abstract = {Learning analytics (LA) is considered a promising field of study as it’s helping to improve learning and the context in which it occurs. A learner’s performance can be defined as how well students are learning in terms of knowledge and skills development and can be analyzed based on students’ outcomes and engagement in the course. We have consolidated the work carried out from 2011 to 2022 to improve learners’ performance using LA, describe criteria that define learners’ performance, discuss parameters that impact learners’ performance, and how predictive models can be created to forecast learners’ performance using these parameters. Results showed that the data collected from log files of the Learning Management System (LMS) had been used to get insights into the learner’s performance in online platforms and LA could bring incredible benefits in the field of the education sector, such as improvement of learners’ involvement with learning activities as well as learning outcomes, identification of students at risk, providing real-time feedback, and personalization of learning. Hence, we can say usage of LA significantly helps learners’ performance improvement in learning portals. But we can get better results if we augment data from log files of LMS with the learner’s personal data from his birth to the current moment, which is a bit challenging with respect to data collection i.e., huge and from multiple sources.}

First, is to fill the educational literature gap by applying machine learning techniques in educational data mining, making use of the Internet usage behaviour log files and LMS data. Second, LMS data and Internet usage log files were analysed with machine learning techniques for predicting at-risk-of-failure students, with greater explanation added by combining student demographic data. Third, the demographic features help to explain the prediction in understandable terms for educators. Fourth, the study used a range of Internet usage data, which were categorized according to type of usage data and type of web browsing data to increase prediction accuracy.}

abstract = {Student modeling is one of the most important processes in adaptive systems. Although learning is individual, a model can be created based on patterns in student behavior. Since a student model can be created for more than one student, the use of machine learning techniques in student modeling is increasing. Artificial neural networks (ANNs), which form one group of machine learning techniques, are among the methods most frequently used in learning environments. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are specific types of these networks, are used effectively for complex problems such as image processing, computer vision and speech recognition. In this study, a student model was created using a CNN due to the complexity of the learning process, and the performance of the model was examined. The student modeling technique used was named LearnerPrints. The navigation data of the students in a learning management system were used to construct the model. Training and test data were used to analyze the performance of the model. The classification results showed that CNNs can be used effectively for student modeling. The modeling was based on the students’ achievement and used the students’ data from the learning management system. The study found that the LearnerPrints technique classified students with an accuracy of over 80%.}

We reviewed peer-reviewed and grey-literature articles of 2007 to 2018 describing the perspectives of staff and students in tertiary education on the use of student-generated data in data analytics, including learning analytics. We used an ethics framework to categorize the findings. There was considerable variation but generally low awareness and understanding amongst students and staff about the nature and extent of data collection, data analytics, and use of predictive analytics. Staff and students identified potential benefits but also expressed concerns about misinterpretation of data, constant surveillance, poor transparency, inadequate support, and potential to impede active learning. This review supports the contention that consideration of ethical issues has failed to keep pace with the development of predictive analytics in the tertiary sector.}

abstract = {Demand for online education has increased in recent decades. Uptake of postgraduate nursing education in this mode is on the rise, yet many students do not achieve completion. Student engagement is vital to success in online postgraduate nursing programs. Technology enables a more efficient means of monitoring engagement, yet limited literature is available on how the design of online postgraduate nursing programs impacts student engagement. This integrative review aims to identify barriers and facilitators to engaging in online postgraduate nursing programs. Four databases, including Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Education Resources Information Center, Scopus, and Medline, were systematically searched to identify relevant literature published over the period 1990 to 2022. Fifteen papers met the inclusion criteria. Thematic analysis generated three themes: design and delivery, support and connectivity, and student factors and success. The findings of this review uncover the range of indiscriminate variables and experiences that students have with online learning, making engaging instructional design a complex process. Nursing faculty require time and resources to develop skills specific to delivering “distance” education without being distant to the students. This review concludes that online postgraduate nursing programs are not a panacea, with ethical issues identified for higher education providers.}

Specifically, this study investigated semester grade point average (GPA) and semester-to-semester persistence of community college students as outcomes. Methods: This study involved two stages of analysis. First, we used inverse probability of treatment weighting to create appropriately balanced samples of the students offered proactive assistance and students not offered proactive assistance to approximate a randomized control trial with observational data. Then, we applied regression analyses with weights and covariates to the balanced samples to estimate outcomes. Results: Using regression analyses with weights and covariates, we estimated few statistically significant results in sample subgroup models and no statistically significant results for whole-group samples. Generally, our analyses found that the offer of the intervention had no effect on students’ persistence and semester GPAs. Conclusions/Contributions: This study contributes empirical results to the emerging literature regarding student-success coaching, predictive analytics, and student-monitoring systems. The results demonstrate the necessity of performing rigorous analyses on these predictive-analytic systems and reveals ethical concerns that should be considered in designing interventions.}

In this paper, we adopted a learning analytics approach to explore student engagement with formative assessments and the power of these assessments to predict student outcomes in an English for Academic Purposes courses in a Hong Kong university. The study retrieved the data logs from 7,815 students and used the data to analyze student engagement with the formative assessments. The results suggested that the students put effort into completing the assessments. The degree to which assessments predict learning outcomes depend on students’ level of subject knowledge and their understanding of the relevance of the assessments. This study showed that learning analytics provided reliable evidence for understanding students’ engagement and identifying at-risk students. Therefore, learning analytics research has the potential to inform pedagogical practice.}

The articles in this special issue evidence that agency, engagement, self-efficacy, and collaboration are needed in learning and working with intelligent tools and environments. The importance of social elements is also clear in the articles. The articles also point out that the teacher’s role in digital pedagogy primarily involves facilitating and coaching. AI in learning has a high potential, but it also has many limitations. Many worries are linked with ethical issues, such as biases in algorithms, privacy, transparency, and data ownership. This special issue also highlights the concepts of explainability and explicability in the context of human learning.

abstract = {Applied areas of entrepreneurship are growing in popularity due to the ongoing need for students to gain specialised skills to find employment after graduation. This study explores how educational scaffolding can facilitate the delivery of online experiential activities to improve the entrepreneurial learning experience and the performance of music management students by using information and communications technology tools within the virtual learning environment. A case study methodology was adopted to present two scenarios of innovative online learning delivered in a postgraduate programme in music management. This research takes into consideration the difficult transitional journey for some students from studying to being immediately thrust into the workplace, which often requires different types of knowledge, experience, skills and competences. The findings show that, by strengthening industry links, tutors can build a portfolio of online practical activities that represent the ‘real-life’ industry, helping to forge long-term, collaborative partnerships to facilitate learners’ acquisition of more meaningful knowledge and opportunities.}

abstract = {The use of on-line education (OLE) to deliver higher education using learning management systems (LMS) has received growing critical attention for its reliance on precarious faculty, high dropout and failure rates, and as a form of privatization. While these critiques are well grounded, they overlook the role of OLE as a strategy for rationalizing teaching and deskilling academic labor in order to produce more self-disciplined precarious “platform” workers who can labor remotely under the control of algorithmic management. To recompose the power of academic workers, new tactics, strategies, and objectives based on an analysis of the new technical composition of capital in higher education are needed.}

abstract = {Online learning communities are becoming increasingly popular as they are known to support collaborative dialogue and knowledge building. Previous studies have typically focused on small, closed learning communities from an individual, static, and aggregated perspective. This research aims to advance our understanding of open and large online learning networks by exploring and characterizing community level dynamics and communities of performance. To achieve this goal, we mined a large open online learning network of over 30,000 students and approximately one million posts. First, we analyzed overall community network development by building temporal social networks. Subsequently, we studied sub-community dynamics using community detection algorithms, and, following that, investigated the interaction between community dynamics and communities of performance using best colleague correlation and Kruskal-Wallis test. Results found that large open online learning communities begin with a very large network having numerous small sub-communities. These communities consist of students who are similar in performance with strong links. The overall network size gradually shrinks, as does the number of sub-communities, and these communities evolve over time for their membership formulation with students who are more different in performance with weaker ties. Theoretical, practical, and methodological implications are then discussed. This study pushed the online learning community research to examine large and open networks by taking a more community-based and dynamic view of investigation.}

abstract = {Smart learning environment (SLE) modules are rapidly expanding with the advancement of technology. However, the concept is still new to many educational institutions in developing countries, with scant studies conducted using the African context. To avoid being left behind in the steps towards modernization, the qualitative study proposes the need to migrate from a traditional learning environment (TLE) to a SLE. Thirty-eight (38) teachers in Ghana who transitioned from TLE to a SLE were recruited to explore their pedagogical experiences in instructing in TLE (old classrooms) and SLE (new classrooms). Generally, teachers favoured SLE compared to TLE. Teachers were motivated to instruct in smart schools because of the affordances of smart technologies. They considered the ambience created in SLE as conducive to promoting their psychological well-being, facilitating their professional development, fostering good assessment strategies, and building twenty-first-century skills in learners needed in the labour market. However, a majority of the teachers perceived self-regulation and social interactions to be more effective in TLE. The key challenges in the SLE included network lag, limited funds to purchase data bundles, malfunction of learning management systems (LMS), and difficulty in designing a Smart App tailored to instructors’ and students’ interests. It is recommended that school administrators and policymakers continually revise SLE frameworks for a successful smart education. Future researchers can investigate how to promote personalized and adaptive learning in SLE and promising tools to assist instructors in technology-enhanced learning environments.}

It seeks to understand how VTAs could be implemented in the classroom while ensuring student and teacher well-being, success, and happiness. Through interviews with fourteen different experts spanning industry, academia, and education, combined with extensive review of the existing literature and ecosystem of VTAs, research shows that VTAs are potentially a major aid in the context of exam review, after school tutoring, automated grading, and student performance reporting. However, they need to be created carefully with an attentive eye towards student support to ensure that the learning experience is not diminished. It must be clearly communicated to all stakeholders that the goal of a VTA is not to replace teachers, but rather to support them such that they can spend more time with students and less time on mundane tasks.}

abstract = {Social Media (SM)’s use as pedagogical tools in Higher Education (HE) institutions is gaining robust momentum among researchers from different disciplines. While most universities implemented Learning Management Systems (Blackboard Learn, Moodle, etc.) as essential instruments in their teaching and learning(T&L) methods, the adoption of SM platforms such as Facebook, YouTube, etc., as in-class educational and communication tools is still in its infancy. Despite the numerous available studies on SM’s adoption as T&L instruments in HE, little has been made to develop a standard framework for SM’s integration as effective educational tool in classroom environments. This paper followed a thematic review of 19 relevant studies to analyse and identify common practices and findings on SM’s inclusion as T&L tools in HE. Subsequently, the findings formed the basis in developing a conceptual framework for SM’s integration as pedagogical tools in HE classrooms. This framework introduces SM’s adoption process as a formal educational tool, the development of SM implementation processes, and assists in understanding the influence of SM on education environments. The research outlines major findings in current literature, thereby, providing valuable insights on SM’s use in education, besides forming the basis for future quantitative and qualitative researches in this area of study.}

To accomplish this, the study drew upon the transactional distance theory and the community of inquiry framework. Using log data from the LMS platform, the study analyzed the impact of student-faculty interaction, student-content interaction, and student-systems interaction on learning outcomes. The sample consisted of online classes offered in the Department of International Marketing at B University in Korea during the spring semester of 2022. The study specifically targeted classes with 40 or more students to ensure an adequate sample size. The researchers used parallelism tests to confirm the validity of the research model, followed by a goodness of fit test with an ordinal Logit model. The results indicated that all three factors of interaction (content, teaching, and platform) had a significant positive effect on learning outcomes, while student-Zoom interaction did not. The interaction between learners and content was found to be the most important predictor of learning achievement, suggesting that student engagement with course materials plays a crucial role in their academic success. The study’s findings have important implications for educators who are interested in improving online teaching and learning. The study recommends expanding the empirical analysis of the research model from the existing structural equation or multiple regression model to the ordinal logit model to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the impact of these factors on student achievement. Overall, the study highlights the importance of considering the complex interaction between content, teaching, and platform in designing and delivering effective online courses that promote student engagement and achievement.}

This research adopts the potential of distributed computing paradigms, that is, mobile edge, for improving the effectiveness of m-learning performance in higher education. Edge computing enables computing at the network’s edge and effectively avoids latencies while processing learners’ computational requests. The envisioned architecture was designed on the ETSI MEC ISG protocols and deployed on the university mobile cloud infrastructure. Additionally, a use case was designed, focusing the edge computing’s latency-avoiding ability, and executing it in a real-time environment involving sixteen students from an academic course. The execution results validated the architecture’s contribution, such as tasks executed in the local server, optimized learner privacy, reduced latencies, instant access, lowered bandwidth consumption, and continued tasks’ execution despite the failure of smart nodes. The result influences user acceptance and attracts designers to extend the architecture base focusing on machine learning algorithms (for learning analytics) and blockchain (to prevent malicious attacks) to improve the effectiveness of learning management system performance.}

In e-learning platforms, the evaluation of flow state is a complex task because it depends on the ability to extract the parameters that better reflect the activity and effort of students. In this scope, the current study proposes a method based on flow theory aiming to provide information about the students’ flow state in a course that is taught in an e-learning environment. First, the interaction of students with an e-learning platform that comprises classical e-learning pages and a timeline tool is analyzed, using activity heatmaps and deep neural networks. Then, by taking also in account their grades, the flow state of students is calculated. The resulted data are validated with a statistical analysis that also utilizes student surveys. In order to guarantee that this method is applicable to various profiles, students from different faculties participated in this study. In a period where education is rapidly adapting to online lectures and e-learning platforms, the estimation of student’s flow state in e-learning environments can provide useful feedback and data to students and educators.}

abstract = {Predictive uses of data are becoming widespread in institutional settings as actors seek to anticipate people and their activities. Predictive modeling is increasingly the subject of scholarly and public criticism. Less common, however, is scrutiny directed at the data that inform predictive models beyond concerns about homogenous training data or general epistemological critiques of data. In this paper, I draw from a qualitative case study set in higher education in the United States to investigate the making of data. Data analytics projects at universities have become more pervasive and intensive to better understand and anticipate undergraduate student bodies. Drawing from 12 months of ethnographic research at a large public university, I analyze the ways data personnel at the institution—data scientists, administrators, and programmers—sort student data into “attributes” and “behaviors,” where “attributes” are demographic data that students “can’t change.” “Behaviors,” in contrast, are data defined as reflective of what students can choose: attending and paying attention in class, studying on campus, among other data which personnel categorize as what students have control over. This discursive split enables the institution nudge students to make responsible choices according to behavior data that correlate with success in the predictive model. In discussing how personnel type, sort, stabilize, and nudge on behavior data, this paper examines the contingencies of data making processes and implications for the application of student data.}

The reflection was able to explore positive and negative experiences, as well as the problems the students faced during online learning, particularly in the aspects of teaching. The study population was enrolled in an Economic Education Program that ran from January to June 2021, and consisted of 15 participants. Three core subjects were selected as the sample. This sampling considered the problems that many education stakeholders complained about, that is, the low professional competency of the study program during online learning. This is why the three subjects were chosen as the core subjects in achieving the main competencies for prospective economics teachers. Thus, PjBL was conducted on three subjects: Development Economics, Human Resource Economics, and Development Planning. After the assessment was carried out, the data showed that positive student learning experiences tended to be higher than negative ones, and P21 ability aspects were much higher than critical thinking and collaboration.}

Recommendation systems aid learners to select relevant courses and content based on their preferences, interest and learning goals from MOOC. Various factors are considered in course recommendation systems however little research has been done in recommending courses based on learning styles despite its significance laid down by various studies. Most studies have focused on content filtering matching with learners learning style instead from a course. This research study is oriented towards learning style-based course categorization using course content delivery information data from a MOOC platform. The Felder-Silverman learning style model (FSLSM) has been used to develop a course learning style support identification model. The effectiveness of the model developed is analyzed through an experimental study performed on real-time data due to absence of a standard data set for course contents and learning style relationships. The model threshold values are finetuned through the results obtained from the experimental. The application of the course learning style identification model is demonstrated by conducting test case studies consisting of users with different learning styles and recommending courses from a MOOC platform with matching learning style.}

abstract = {The emergence of big data in educational contexts has led to new data-driven approaches to support informed decision making and efforts to improve educational effectiveness. Digital traces of student behavior promise more scalable and finer-grained understanding and support of learning processes, which were previously too costly to obtain with traditional data sources and methodologies. This synthetic review describes the affordances and applications of microlevel (e.g., clickstream data), mesolevel (e.g., text data), and macrolevel (e.g., institutional data) big data. For instance, clickstream data are often used to operationalize and understand knowledge, cognitive strategies, and behavioral processes in order to personalize and enhance instruction and learning. Corpora of student writing are often analyzed with natural language processing techniques to relate linguistic features to cognitive, social, behavioral, and affective processes. Institutional data are often used to improve student and administrational decision making through course guidance systems and early-warning systems. Furthermore, this chapter outlines current challenges of accessing, analyzing, and using big data. Such challenges include balancing data privacy and protection with data sharing and research, training researchers in educational data science methodologies, and navigating the tensions between explanation and prediction. We argue that addressing these challenges is worthwhile given the potential benefits of mining big data in education.}

abstract = {Digital technology in education has become a staple of many contemporary classrooms. Educational technology offers many benefits, including access to knowledge, mobility, multiple means of engagement, accessibility, distance learning, as well as the ability to connect in unprecedented ways. There is a growing body of research that examines digital learning tools, online classroom environments, learning management systems and other technologies that are integrated into the learning process. Such research extends to analysing the positive impacts of online and blended learning; however, few studies explore the user preferences of the learners. Without assessment of the user preference, the benefits of learning through technology are often lessened. This research explores and analyses how user media preferences influence engagement and motivation in online learning. One hundred twenty-two KS3 (13-year-olds) secondary school were provided voluntary access to a purpose-built online learning resource that augmented their in-class Holocaust history curriculum with learning materials in audio, video and e-text. Data were collected through web analytics and user feedback forms. The analytical tools provided detailed quantitative data on user activity on the site, while the feedback forms yielded qualitative data on usefulness and enjoyment. Results provided insights on the usage trends and user preferences that influence engagement. These behavioural patterns reflect user motivation and learning preferences and can be utilised to personalise digital content delivery to increase engagement with online learning material.}

abstract = {Compared to the abundant generic research on technologies and education, few studies focus on the scope of whether the technologies used meet the expectations set forth in international reports and to what extent technology contributes to transforming educational practice. Our objective was to identify and analyze the characteristics of educational practices that are being developed in higher education and to assess the value that technology brings to educational practice. We conducted a systematic review of academic papers published in scientific journals: a corpus of 1,207 articles from six journals included in indexed databases (JCR and SJR), selected using Google Scholar Metrics. According to the various records screened, the study we present is based on 49 articles, published between 2018 and 2019. We conclude that beyond their reproducible, enriching, or transformative nature, most of the articles analyzed address the improvement of students’ performance, engagement, or self-perception, in which they positively value the experience of learning mediated by digital technology, although they do not have an impact on the transformative value.}

abstract = {Background: Male students’ achievements in female-dominated study programs have garnered limited research attention. This study investigates the relationship between psychology students’ perceived diversity climate and their learning outcomes in a gender-mixed computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) course in introductory psychology. Our main hypotheses were that the diversity climate—learning outcome relationships would be stronger for male (gender minority) than for female students (gender majority). Methods: This study used data from a large sample of university first-year students at a blended learning university (n = 1,172, 75% female) with three points of measurement in a 9-week CSCL assignment. Findings: Moderated-mediation regression analyses confirmed that students’ perceptions of the diversity climate in their CSCL group were significantly related to gains in online learning self-efficacy among male, but not female students. Furthermore, by increasing gains in self-efficacy, climate perceptions also translated into better quiz performance among male students. Contributions: This study shows that for men perceived diversity climate is a significant determinant of their individual learning outcomes. This calls for paying more attention to the minority perspectives of males in female-dominated psychological programs to better understand why this is the cas.}

abstract = {The Problem Technology has affected almost every aspect of our lives, including education. Higher education is shifting the dynamics of delivery methods from traditional face-to-face to online to blended modes. Many universities are reaching a physical space capacity and therefore are attempting to increase online enrollment and geographical footprint. These changes are shifting the nature of higher education and how faculty are being viewed, evaluated, and, to some degree, hired. This article will focus on highlighting the challenges and opportunities of utilizing technology within universities, especially human resource development (HRD) programs. The Solution Technology is transforming higher education. Institutions can serve as an incubator to reimagine and redesign education altogether for the good of society. Online, mobile, and blended learning have become a part of our future. An important step is tracking how these models are actively enriching learning outcomes. Universities must be at the forefront of advancing progressive learning approaches and understanding the impact of technology on faculty and students. The Stakeholders The key stakeholders for this article include faculty, students, and university administrators. It will also affect businesses and human resource professionals for talent acquisition.}

abstract = {Serious games are considered an effective method to engage students in programming education and have been increasingly used in classrooms. An important part of the learning process with serious games involves the presentation of the new concepts and the provided support to encounter student difficulties. Although the most common approach is the use of instructional text, it comes with some drawbacks. This paper proposes an alternative method for user support in serious games about programming which mitigates current problems and provides improved learning efficiency. An experiment was conducted (N = 291) to test textual instructions learning efficiency compared to in-game worked examples. Two randomly assigned groups used different types of support in a block-based game, developed for the study. Our implementation provided support through a non-player character who executed worked examples inside the game world. The analysis showed a significant statistical difference in score performance between the two supports on both novice and experienced students. The results point to increased learning efficiency by students, when in-game worked examples and problem-solving are combined. We further argue that the Cognitive load theory can provide adequate justification for the outcomes.}

abstract = {Collaboration proves to be an effective way to facilitate students’ engagement and solve the mostly-mentioned problems of blended learning (BL). For collaborative BL, self-regulated learning (SRL), self-efficacy and engagement are frequently referred to in BL studies and represent key elements of effective BL. Furthermore, the interaction of these elements correlates closely with the performance of students. There have been few research attempts to draw synergies and explore the relationship among these key elements. To address this gap, data were collected through a questionnaire and records on LMS from 125 students in a Chinese university. Descriptive analytics show that students fully recognize the positive effects of collaborative BL. Correlation analysis and regression analysis find that self-regulated learning (SRL) is significantly correlated with all factors except workload. It is also a significant predictor of behavioral engagement. Therefore, SRL proves to be central among the essential BL elements. Emotional engagement is significantly correlated to and interact with multiple key BL factors. Specifically, emotional engagement is a significant predictor of behavioral engagement. The findings offer insight into the interactions of key elements of BL and provide practical implications for improving BL learning design.}

Studies have shown that before introducing the technology to their pupils, educators should do a thorough assessment of the technology’s viability and possible acceptance in the classroom. However, not much is synthesized from the body of knowledge about the leadership and coupling of VR and AR in education, including its trends and direction of research in other domains. In this article, the bibliometric and content analysis has shown that interest in virtual reality and augmented reality has increased from 2018 to 2022 in the Web of Science database. The patterns formed from Vosviewer in the bibliometric analysis have also portrayed that Virtual reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) are used in many fields, including education, medicine, arts, engineering, business, and marketing. Other results from data mining showed the authors with the most publications in the field, their affiliated universities, and the source of publications. In the wake of the Covid-19 epidemic, these findings may also help improve educational opportunities for all students and the quality of instruction they receive. As implications, Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) harness current technology to put digital content in the actual world, enabling consumers to have a more meaningful interaction with it on desktop or hand-held devices. This bibliometric research shows that animation, 3D graphics, and sound may replace more traditional ways of schooling in the future.}

The results show that ChatGPT is capable of providing answers that exceed the mean responses of students across all institutions. The emergence of artificial intelligence presents a significant challenge to traditional assessment methods in higher education. An important implication of this finding is that educators will likely need to redesign their curriculum in at least one of the following three ways: reintroduce proctored, in-person assessments; augment learning with chatbots; and/or increase the prevalence of experiential learning projects that artificial intelligence struggles to replicate well.}

abstract = {OBJECTIVES Generative artificial intelligence (AI) models such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Bard have forced educators to consider how these tools will be efficiently utilized to improve medical education. This article investigates current literature on how generative AI is and could be used and implemented in undergraduate medical education (UME). METHODS A rapid review of the literature was performed utilizing a librarian-generated search strategy to identify articles published before June 30, 2023, in 6 databases (Pubmed, EMBASE.com, Scopus, ERIC via EBSCO, Computer Science Database via EBSCO, and CINAHL via EBSCO). Inclusion criteria were (1) a focus on osteopathic and/or allopathic UME and (2) a defined use or implementation strategy for generative AI. Two reviewers screened all articles, and data extraction was performed by 1 reviewer and confirmed by the other reviewer. RESULTS A total of 521 relevant articles were screened during this review. Forty-one articles underwent full-text review and data extraction. The majority of the articles were opinion pieces (9), case reports (8), letters to the editor (5), editorials (5), and commentaries (3) about the use of generative AI while 7 articles used qualitative and/or quantitative methods. The literature is best divided into 5 categories of uses for generative AI in UME: nonclinical learning assistant, content developer, virtual patient interaction, clinical decision-making tutor, and medical writing. The literature indicates generative AI tools’ greatest potential is for use as a virtual patient and clinical decision-making tutor. CONCLUSIONS While the possibilities proliferate for generative AI in UME, there remains a dearth of quantitative evidence of its use for improving learner outcomes. The majority of the literature opines the potential for utilization, but only 7 studies formally evaluated the results of using generative AI. Future research should focus on the effectiveness of incorporating generative AI into preclinical and clinical curricula in UME.}

abstract = {A problem-based immersive virtual environment (IVE) about bushfire safety was developed as a learning tool for children aged 10–12. Its effectiveness was assessed in relation to children’s ability to determine how to be safer in a bushfire incident. A series of experiential activities were developed in the IVE with digital storytelling and two-stage embedded assessments providing children with an opportunity to engage with tasks and solve problems while receiving feedback on their performance. Changes from pre- to postsurvey results showed positive learning outcomes as evidenced by significant improvements in children’s knowledge of bushfire safety and confidence in their ability to contribute to decisions during a bushfire incident. The significant change in children’s knowledge as well as their performance at two-stage embedded assessments was independent of their gender, background knowledge and perceived ability in responding to bushfire hazards. This suggests that when appropriately designed and implemented within educational settings, immersive virtual learning tools can effectively engage children and enhance learning outcomes associated with bushfire safety. The paper also argues that such immersive problem-based learning can improve self-efficacy amongst children in relation to coping with a bushfire situation. Implications of the findings are also discussed.}

abstract = {With the recent COVID-19 pandemic and disruption of campus-based education, the use of mobile social networking applications to supplement formal education has attracted a great deal of attention. Teachers do have opportunities to join students’ online groups to share, clarify, and exchange housekeeping information and course-related content with them. Teachers can, in particular, provide English as a foreign language (EFL) students with more sources of linguistic input, interaction, and feedback. Research investigating this potential, however, is still scarce in such contexts. The current study explores the likely affordances of teaching presence in students’ WhatsApp groups for designing, facilitating, and guiding cognitive and social processes conducive to their language learning. A mixed-method design was employed to collect both quantitative and qualitative data and information from English-major undergraduates (N = 111) and faculty teachers (N = 8) who joined the same WhatsApp groups for one academic semester at a major university in Oman. Descriptive and thematic analyses of data from a survey with both closed-ended and open-ended questions and semi-structured interviews indicate that the shared WhatsApp groups functioned as small close-knit communities where students were able to constantly access teachers for their assistance, feedback, and clarification of content. Despite these merits, however, the participating faculty believed that the presence of teachers in WhatsApp groups might have consequences for students’ tolerance of ambiguity, scaffolding, and autonomous language learning. The paper concludes by discussing several pedagogical implications and directions for future research.}

However, the fit of game mechanisms is still uncertain. Thus, this study investigates the effect of achieving fit when implementing game mechanisms on learning outcomes by applying the well-known task-technology fit theory (TTF). TTF is frequently employed to improve fit between tasks to be completed and the technology applied. The findings indicate that achieving gamification fit can reduce the cognitive load of students and result in enhanced learning performance in terms of learning outcomes. Data collected from 266 participants were analyzed using the technique of the partial least squares to validate the developed research model. The findings of this study can aid educators and educational technology designers in identifying the design mechanisms and characteristics that can be used to ensure design fit on gamification platforms.}

abstract = {Many institutions of higher education systems worldwide are transitioning from face-to-face modality to e-learning as a means of solving issues of limited resources and access to quality education. One of the crucial prerequisites for the successful implementation of e-learning is a careful consideration of emerging technologies and the underlying pedagogy of how learning takes place using a virtual platform. In practice, however, this consideration is often a neglected aspect in developing countries’ context, and this neglect results in several challenges in academic setups. This study identifies and evaluates clusters of e-learning features and implementation strategies in use and challenges sought at the ET Online College located in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The features of these strategies are briefly discussed, as well as how these strategies evolved during the implementation processes. The college’s e-learning components have achieved merits for quality by their primary users (online students, e-course instructors, and technology, instructional design, and curriculum experts), web designers and graphic designers, and administrators within the college. These also achieved acceptance nationally by the larger key stakeholders. The findings and recommendations of the study can be used as empirical evidence-base to help policymakers strategically think about the implementation of e-learning in the Ethiopian Higher Education institutions, and other similar contexts at large.}

abstract = {When considering digital futures for universities it is the instrumentalising narratives developed by corporate ‘ed-tech’ which often drive the debate. These are narratives which, aligning tightly to marketisation, unbundling and other dominant ideological trends, describe a highly technologised, datafied and surveillant future for teaching. This future is often framed as an imperative, leaving university communities with the sense that a future is being designed for them over which they have relatively little control. This paper describes the theory, methods and outcomes of a project which set out to counter this tendency, using participative, co-design methods within a ‘top down’ policy initiative to envision an alternative future for digital education within our own institution. Our starting point was that universities need to get better at crafting their own, compelling counter-narratives concerning the future of technology in teaching, in order to assert the agency and presence of the academic and student bodies in the face of technological change. In working toward this, we drew on recent thinking in anticipation studies in education and developed an original methodology for participative futures work within universities. The paper reports on the outcomes of this project, and its implications for the sector more generally, arguing that university communities can work to define their own digital futures through an emphasis on collectivity, participation and hope.}

abstract = {In the U.S., we have historically looked to our educators to prepare citizens for full participation in our democracy as engaged and informed voters. We examine the student voting movement that has taken root in colleges and universities across the country—a movement that offers a promising way forward in forming a new generation of engaged citizens. We detail what we know about how to increase student turnout, suggest ways to strengthen voter mobilization efforts through a broader civic education agenda, chart a path forward for future research, and offer recommendations for college administrators who seek to make voting a lifelong habit for their students. We also look beyond the student voting movement to argue for new forms of pedagogy that foster civic identity so that students think of themselves as voters who always vote, because voting is a necessary way to express themselves as engaged citizens.}

abstract = {Feedback can occur before and after assessment submission, but needs to be useful in order for students to improve their subsequent performance. Arguably, undergraduate students, and particularly international, online and new students, are especially in need of feedback to effectively engage in academic and disciplinary expectations. Therefore, this article draws on survey data from students, disaggregated by mode of study, citizenship of enrolment and year of study, to explore their experiences of feedback usefulness both before and after assessment submission. Overall, undergraduate students were positive; however, this perception decreased according to their year level. Comparisons between online and international students also revealed key differences. A conclusion is that undergraduate students cannot be treated homogeneously, and educators need to attend to the feedback experiences of different student groups as they progress through their programm.}

abstract = {This paper introduces the concept of infrastructure into discussions on climate change and education. We focus on the links between the increased use of digital data and the central role of data infrastructures in education, and the energy infrastructure needed to support their growing use in schools and school systems. We elaborate a need for a greater accounting of the climate and related social costs of these interwoven digital and energy infrastructures of schooling. We suggest this is part of the ‘disposition’ of the infrastructures of schooling that should be weighed into decisions on whether and how to continue with digital technologies in schools. By acknowledging the climate and environmental incommensurability of digital infrastructures, education leaders and young people can more fully understand their dispositions and their costs. We propose three implications for education governance that entail greater consideration of the limits of current school climate change infrastructures such as ‘eco school’ programs and EdTech ‘AI for good’ initiatives, pushes for ‘computing within limits’ without substantial changes, and current school governance practices which unnecessarily rely on digital infrastructures. Instead, what is needed may be a reversal of the extensive use of digital infrastructures by schools and education governance bodies.}

abstract = {During various learning activities, teachers and students need to clarify, explore and share their understanding of reading materials. For doing this, they must make explicit the mental representation constructed during the reading process. In this article, we propose an approach combining semantic annotations and semantic networks as formal means for elicitation, structuring, formalisation, analysis and sharing of teachers’ and students’ understanding of textual materials that they are asked to read in learning tasks. In the proposed approach, teachers can create learning tasks, in which students are asked to semantically annotate a text by associating portions of it to resources described in a Knowledge Base (KB) in accordance with a provided ontology. New instances can be created by students or teachers in the KB during the annotation process. We show how semantic networks can be used to visualise extracts of the resulting KB, and to help people organise their comprehension of texts. In addition, teachers can assess student evolution by analysing the semantic networks that each one produces during the reading and annotation process. This approach is implemented by using our annotation tool, integrated with a digital repository and a virtual learning environment. An empirical evaluation of the benefits of the proposed approach in a literature case study confirms that it facilitates information extraction, sharing and analysis, contributing to leverage teaching and learning.}

Eighty percent of teachers reported interacting with students online, often utilizing free technology like Zoom and Google Workspace for Education. This article provides a comprehensive overview of state education agencies’ recommendations for emergency remote teaching during the COVID-19 school closures in early 2020. Reviewing 337 publicly available documents from 50 state education agencies reveals a fragmented response: state education agencies relied on nongovernmental organizations to do the work of governance.}

abstract = {Providing feedback on student work is a key part of the teaching process. Ideally, students use the provided feedback to learn and improve future work. In the age of technology-mediated learning, it is essential to study how technology affects the feedback process. This work uses data captured by a Learning Management System (LMS) to measure whether students view the feedback provided by an instructor. Unfortunately, the data show that only a limited number of students actually viewed the provided feedback. A technology-focused review of the feedback process is used to identify how technology may contribute to students’ limited use of feedback. Suggestions are offered for how instructors, pedagogy researchers, and developers of technology used in learning can collaborate to ensure that technology supports the best pedagogical practices identified by research and also provides the tools and data needed to support ongoing pedagogical research.}
