abstract="Analytics in educational environments has received much attention during the last few years. Maintaining a high retention rate is still a major concern in higher educational institutions. Therefore, this research aims to early detect students at risk using three machine learning predictive models, namely support vector machine (SVM), neural networks (NN), and K nearest-neighbors (KNN), based on a new dataset collected from 800 students through surveys. The criteria used to evaluate the models were accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Regarding the accuracy, the SVM model has outperformed the NN and KNN models, where it achieves 86.7{\%}. Concerning the sensitivity, the NN model was more sensitive to detect failure cases than the other two models. Regarding the specificity, it was very high for the three models. It is believed that the results could assist the educators in early detecting students at risk, and therefore, reducing students' dropouts.",

abstract = {This study investigates the effectiveness of machine learning and deep learning models for early prediction of student performance in higher education institutions. Using the Open University Learning Analytics (OULA) dataset, various models, including Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, Neural Network, and Ensemble Model, were employed to predict student performance in three categories: Pass/Fail, Close to Fail, and Close to Pass. The Ensemble Model (EM) consistently outperformed other models, achieving the highest overall F1 measure, precision, recall, and accuracy. These results highlight the potential of data-driven techniques in informing educational stakeholders’ decision-making processes, enabling targeted interventions, and facilitating personalized learning strategies tailored to students’ needs. By identifying at-risk students early in the academic year, institutions can provide additional support to improve academic outcomes and retention rates. The study also discusses practical implications, including the development of pedagogical policies and guidelines based on early predictions, which can help educational institutions maintain strong academic outcomes and enhance their reputation for academic excellence. Future research aims to investigate the impact of individual activities on student performance and explore day-to-day student behaviors, enabling the creation of tailored pedagogical policies and guideline.}

abstract = {In information security context, social engineering is defined as malicious activities caused by cybercriminals by means of human interactions. It is mainly a psychological manipulation technique which gets benefit of human error to reach private information. This study used machine learning algorithms to predict individuals’ susceptibility to be tricked by social engineering attacks. Simulated scenarios were presented to study participants, and they were asked to identify whether each scenario was a social engineering attack or not. Different kinds of attacks related to various industries were integrated to social engineering simulations. For each participant, different types of social engineering scores were calculated according to their responses. Besides simulations, questionnaires related to demographics, technology usage, and personality traits were filled out by the participants. All of these collected data were used in building predictive classification and regression machine learning models. Through regression and classification models, it was aimed to proactively predict individuals’ social engineering risk levels and classify them into different risk groups in terms of different attack types. This research revealed that it is possible to predetermine the social engineering risk levels of individuals. This important finding means that possible attacks can be prevented by raising awareness before the attack occurs. Within the scope of this study, a social engineering risk detection mobile application has also been developed to give practitioners and policy makers an idea of what kind of systems can be developed in order to determine the risk levels of individuals and then to educate them about various attacks. The ones who need to take action against social engineering attacks will get benefit from findings of this research.}

abstract = {Blended learning pedagogical practices supported by learning management systems have become an important part of higher education curricula. In most cases, these blended curricula are evaluated through multimodal formative assessments. Although assessments can strongly affect student outcomes, research on the topic is limited. In this paper, we adopted a learning analytics approach to explore student engagement with formative assessments and the power of these assessments to predict student outcomes in an English for Academic Purposes courses in a Hong Kong university. The study retrieved the data logs from 7,815 students and used the data to analyze student engagement with the formative assessments. The results suggested that the students put effort into completing the assessments. The degree to which assessments predict learning outcomes depend on students’ level of subject knowledge and their understanding of the relevance of the assessments. This study showed that learning analytics provided reliable evidence for understanding students’ engagement and identifying at-risk students. Therefore, learning analytics research has the potential to inform pedagogical practice.}

abstract = {Advances in machine learning methods and the availability of new data sources show promise for improving prediction of operational risk. Maritime transportation is the backbone of global supply chains and maritime accidents can lead to costly disruptions. We describe a case study performed for the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to develop a prototype risk prediction system to provide early alerts of elevated risk levels to vessel traffic managers and operators in the Lower Mississippi River, the second largest port of entry in the United States. Integrating incident and accident data from the USCG with environmental and traffic data sources, we tested existing machine learning algorithms in their predictive ability. We found poor accident prediction accuracy in cross‐validation using the traditional measures of precision and sensitivity. In this specific operational context, however, such single‐class accuracy metrics can be misleading. We define action precision and action sensitivity metrics that measure the accuracy of predictions in engendering the correct behavioral response (actions) among vessel operators, rather than getting the specific event classification correct. We use these operationally appropriate measures for maritime risk prediction to choose an algorithm for our prototype system. While the traditional metrics indicated that none of the algorithms would perform sufficiently well to use in the early warning system, the modified metrics show that the top performing algorithm will perform well in this operational context.}

abstract = {This research presents a proposed approach that could be applied in modeling students’ study strategies and performance in higher education. The research used key learning attributes, including intrinsic motivation, extrinsic motivation, autonomy, relatedness, competence, and self-esteem in the modeling. Five machine learning models were implemented, trained, evaluated, and tested with data from 924 university students. The comparative analysis reveals that tree-based models, particularly random forest and decision trees, outperform other models, achieving a prediction accuracy of 94.9%. The models built in this research can be used in predicting student study strategies and performance and this can be applied in implementing targeted interventions for improving learning progress. The research findings emphasize the importance of incorporating strategies that address diverse motivation dimensions in online educational systems, as it increases student engagement and promotes continuous learning. The findings also highlight the potential for modeling these attributes collectively to personalize and adapt learning process.}

abstract = {This paper introduces a novel approach to identify at-risk students with a focus on output interpretability through analyzing learning activities at a finer granularity on a weekly basis. Specifically, this approach converts the predicted output from the former weeks into meaningful probabilities to infer the predictions in the current week for maintaining the consecutiveness among learning activities. To demonstrate the efficacy of our model in identifying at-risk students, we compare the weekly AUCs and averaged performance (i.e., accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score) over each course with the baseline models (i.e., Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Decision Tree), respectively. Furthermore, we adopt a Top-K metric to examine the number of at-risk students that the model is able to identify with high precision during each week. Finally, the model output is interpreted through a model-agnostic interpretation approach to support instructors to make informed recommendations for students’ learning. The experimental results demonstrate the capability and interpretability of our model in identifying at-risk students in online learning settings. In addition to that our work also provides significant implications in building accountable machine learning pipelines that can be used to automatically generated individualized learning interventions while considering fairness between different learning groups.}

abstract = {Learning analytics aims at helping the students to attain their learning goals. The predictions in learning analytics are made to enhance the effectiveness of educational interferences. This study predicts student engagement at an early phase of a Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) course by analyzing data collected from consecutive years. The prediction model is developed using machine learning techniques applied to a subset of Open University Learning Analytics Dataset, provided by Open University (OU), Britain. The investigated data belongs to 7,775 students who attended social science courses for consecutive assessment years. The experiments are conducted with a reduced feature set to predict whether the students are highly or lowly engaged in the courses. The attributes indicating students’ interaction with the VLE, their scores, and final results are the most contributing variables for the predictive analysis. Based on these variables, a reduced feature vector is constructed. The baseline used in the study is the linear regression model. The model’s best results showed 95% accurate, 95% precise, and 98% relevant results with the Random Forest classification algorithm. Early prediction’s relevant features are a subset of click activities, which provided a functional interface between the students and the VL.}

abstract = {Distance learning is rapidly gaining ground globally. In this case study, we focused on professional (vocational) teacher education (PTE) student online activity in a blended learning context. We applied learning analytics (LA) to identify students’ (n = 19) online study patterns. Our key interest was in determining when and what kinds of online activity and behavior PTE students engage in during their studies. We applied quantitative content analysis to analyze the students’ behavior. Moodle’s event log enabled us to identify active hours and days, variation in use of learning materials, the impact of interventions, and stumbling blocks to student learning in the study unit. Based on our data, educator availability is an essential factor for good student engagement in digital learning environments. Interaction forums are important for PTE students effective learning. Monday and Tuesday afternoons are the most effective times for educators to be available for PTE students. There is a clear need for contact learning in professional teacher education, even when operating in digital learning environments. It plays an essential role in keeping students’ activity alive. It could be beneficial to plan a post-process for students who do not graduate as planned, including regular group meetings for supporting studies, receiving guidance, and meeting peers. PTE students’ behavior in a distance learning environment in the context of blended learning follows Zipf’s law, which models the occurrence of distinct objects in particular sorts of collections.}

abstract = {Recently, learning analytics (LA) has drawn the attention of academics, researchers, and administrators. This interest is motivated by the need to better understand teaching, learning, “intelligent content,” and personalization and adaptation. While still in the early stages of research and implementation, several organizations (Society for Learning Analytics Research and the International Educational Data Mining Society) have formed to foster a research community around the role of data analytics in education. This article considers the research fields that have contributed technologies and methodologies to the development of learning analytics, analytics models, the importance of increasing analytics capabilities in organizations, and models for deploying analytics in educational settings. The challenges facing LA as a field are also reviewed, particularly regarding the need to increase the scope of data capture so that the complexity of the learning process can be more accurately reflected in analysis. Privacy and data ownership will become increasingly important for all participants in analytics projects. The current legal system is immature in relation to privacy and ethics concerns in analytics. The article concludes by arguing that LA has sufficiently developed, through conferences, journals, summer institutes, and research labs, to be considered an emerging research field.}

abstract = {Massive open online courses (MOOCs) show great potential to transform traditional education through the Internet. However, the high attrition rates in MOOCs have often been cited as a scale-efficacy tradeoff. Traditional educational approaches are usually unable to identify such large-scale number of at-risk students in danger of dropping out in time to support effective intervention design. While building dropout prediction models using learning analytics are promising in informing intervention design for these at-risk students, results of the current prediction model construction methods do not enable personalized intervention for these students. In this study, we take an initial step to optimize the dropout prediction model performance toward intervention personalization for at-risk students in MOOCs. Specifically, based on a temporal prediction mechanism, this study proposes to use the deep learning algorithm to construct the dropout prediction model and further produce the predicted individual student dropout probability. By taking advantage of the power of deep learning, this approach not only constructs more accurate dropout prediction models compared with baseline algorithms but also comes up with an approach to personalize and prioritize intervention for at-risk students in MOOCs through using individual drop out probabilities. The findings from this study and implications are then discussed.}
