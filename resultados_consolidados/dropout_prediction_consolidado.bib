 abstract = {This study examines deviant identity in relation to youth offending by combining items tapping both self-appraisal and reflected appraisal. In particular, using survey data from 3,446 Korean youth across five waves of the Korea Youth Panel Survey (KYPS), findings from group-based trajectory modeling (GBTM) present four distinct offending groups—a high-rate chronic group, stable non-offending group, adolescence-limited group, and declining group. Then, findings from the multinomial logit model reveal that deviant identity is a robust predictor of offending for subgroups of adolescents involved in offending at any level in comparison to stable non-offenders. Accordingly, this study supports the idea that deviant identity should be considered as a prominent predictor of a variety of types of youth offending.},

 abstract = {Purpose: In an era of unprecedented student measurement and emphasis on data-driven educational decision making, the full potential for using data to target resources to students has yet to be realized. This study explores the utility of machine-learning techniques with large-scale administrative data to identify student dropout risk. Research Methods: Using longitudinal student records data from the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction, this article assesses modern prediction techniques, with a focus on tree-based classification methods and support vector machines. These methods incorporate 74 predictors measures from Grades 3 through 8, including academic achievement, behavioral indicators, and socioeconomic and demographic characteristics. Findings: Two of the assessed classification algorithms predict high school graduation and dropping out correctly for more than 90% of an out-of-sample student cohort. Findings reveal a shift toward lower dropout incidence in regions hit hardest by the economic recession of 2008, especially for male students. Implications for Research and Practice: Machine-learning procedures, as demonstrated in this study, offer promise for allowing administrators to reliably identify students at risk of dropping out of school so as to provide targeted, intensive programs at the lowest possible cost.},

 abstract = {Background: Young adults are at elevated risks of hikikomori (severe social withdrawal) under the COVID-19 pandemic, which could lead to psychological distress and suicidal ideation. Aims: The present study aimed to examine the associations among hikikomori, suicide stigma, suicidal ideation, and help-seeking behaviors among young adults in Hong Kong. Method: This study recruited a large sample of 2,022 young adults in Hong Kong via an online survey at the end of 2021. The participants completed the Hikikomori Questionnaire and validated measures on psychological distress, suicide stigma, and suicidal ideation severity and report their help-seeking behaviors. Multivariate analysis of variance was conducted to compare the profiles of the hikikomori groups. Path analysis evaluated the effects of hikikomori and suicide stigma on occurrence and severity of suicidal ideation and their associations with help-seeking behaviors. Results: Hikikomori showed significant and positive indirect effects on prevalence and severity of suicidal ideation via psychological distress. Glorification positively predicted hikikomori and suicidal ideation severity among suicidal persons. Hikikomori was associated with reduced help-seeking. Isolation and suicidal ideation were associated with greater barriers to seek help among the non-help-seekers. Perceived helpfulness of sought help was negatively associated with hikikomori and suicidal ideation among the help-seekers. Conclusions: The present findings demonstrated greater prevalence and severity of suicidal ideation and less help-seeking in young adults with hikikomori. Suicide stigma showed differential associations with hikikomori, suicidal ideation, and help-seeking behaviors.},

 abstract = {Background/Context Amidst the complex and fast-paced demands in schools and classrooms, identifying what most deserves educators’ attention can pose a challenge. Indicators help focus attention by highlighting key features that signal important outcomes or opportunities to take action or learn. Purpose Informed by multiple literatures, we offer a conceptual framework that elaborates on the connection between an indicator’s development and use. Specifically, the framework proposes that how to develop indicators depends on the answers to several questions about how they will be used: the intended use (why), timing (when), content (on what), and threshold (how much). Research Design To explore this conceptual framework, we present two cases on the construction and use of indicators for continuous improvement in the San Francisco Unified School District. In the first case, we applied statistical process control (SPC) theory to create control charts that visualize district-level outliers on student achievement outcomes to examine potential causes of variation among schools. In the second case, we combined SPC with more basic statistical methods to develop indicators highlighting areas of potential promise across multiple measures and student subgroups within a school. In our exploration of the two case studies, we present the statistical methods applied to construct the indicator, an example of the visualizations created, and descriptions of how central office leaders interpreted and used the results. We document how the intended use informed the indicators’ design, and the ramifications of those decisions for educators’ subsequent use of the indicators for improvement. Conclusions and Recommendations In learning from these cases, we highlight the importance of constructing indicators from the perspective of their intended use and linked with specific conditions and potential actions. This requires including more useful process data in the development of those indicators, as well as more follow-up analysis of the effectiveness of the actions taken based on those indicators, contrasted against alternative actions. We also underscore the importance of developing indicators that distinguish between the need for systemic versus targeted improvement efforts, based on SPC. We believe that combining approaches across disciplines and methodologies holds great promise for the development and use of indicators for continuous improvement in education.},

As AI technologies are new to K-12 school curriculum, the research on AI for K-12 classrooms is under explored. In this study, the current state of AI integration in school education and risks associated with it were explored. The study using a systematic review method attempted to explore the findings, observations, and results of recent research regarding the possible risk factors of AI integration in K-12 education. At initial search using predefined key terms, 390 articles were recorded. Using inclusion and exclusion criteria, 71 articles covering 34 journals and other publications were selected for final analysis. Selected 71 articles reported that AI innovation incorporation into K-12 education is associated with certain risks and challenges. Through a systematic review technique, we categorized them into major 6 risk areas namely Privacy and Autonomy Risks, AI Biases, Accuracy and Functional Risks, Deepfakes and FATE Risks, Social Knowledge and Skill Building Risks, and Risk in Shifting Teacher’s Role. The study also explored these risk areas to provide an overview of how these are connected with teaching and learning process of K-12 education.},

Student engagement is an important factor in predicting and preventing high school dropout, and improving student outcomes. Although the relationship between secondary school engagement and high school completion is well supported in existing research, the relationship between secondary school engagement and postsecondary enrollment and persistence is unclear. In this study, we examined whether students’ engagement in high school predicts postsecondary matriculation and persistence in the first year after accounting for demographic and school-level variables. Results indicated secondary student engagement does predict postsecondary enrollment and persistence beyond academic and behavioral variables. Consistent with research among secondary students, the Future Goals and Aspirations Scale of the Student Engagement Instrument was the strongest engagement predictor.

Thus, this study combined machine learning with traditional statistics to identify the most important predictors and to interpret their effects on proficiency in the PISA 2018 mathematics, science, and reading tests. Predictors encompassed a wide range of variables, sociodemographic characteristics, teaching and learning processes, and non-cognitive skills. The outcome of the present study was proficiency in mathematics, science, and reading. PISA proficiency levels were grouped into “low proficiency” and “proficient” categories, using a classification system commonly employed in PISA reports. Using random forest analysis, a machine learning method, I compared the importance of predictors for proficiency in mathematics, science, and reading. I then adjusted multilevel logistic regression analyses to investigate the relationship between the top predictors and the outcomes. Among the top predictors for the three outcomes identified, annual household income, parents’ highest occupational status, and early childhood education and care were positively associated with proficiency in mathematics, science, and reading, while grade repetition and additional instruction were negatively associated with these outcomes. These findings urge Brazilian policymakers and educators to prioritize initiatives that strengthen early childhood programs, minimize grade repetition, and promote effective learning strategies.},

 abstract = {Massive open online courses (MOOCs) show great potential to transform traditional education through the Internet. However, the high attrition rates in MOOCs have often been cited as a scale-efficacy tradeoff. Traditional educational approaches are usually unable to identify such large-scale number of at-risk students in danger of dropping out in time to support effective intervention design. While building dropout prediction models using learning analytics are promising in informing intervention design for these at-risk students, results of the current prediction model construction methods do not enable personalized intervention for these students. In this study, we take an initial step to optimize the dropout prediction model performance toward intervention personalization for at-risk students in MOOCs. Specifically, based on a temporal prediction mechanism, this study proposes to use the deep learning algorithm to construct the dropout prediction model and further produce the predicted individual student dropout probability. By taking advantage of the power of deep learning, this approach not only constructs more accurate dropout prediction models compared with baseline algorithms but also comes up with an approach to personalize and prioritize intervention for at-risk students in MOOCs through using individual drop out probabilities. The findings from this study and implications are then discussed.},

Specifically, this approach converts the predicted output from the former weeks into meaningful probabilities to infer the predictions in the current week for maintaining the consecutiveness among learning activities. To demonstrate the efficacy of our model in identifying at-risk students, we compare the weekly AUCs and averaged performance (i.e., accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score) over each course with the baseline models (i.e., Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Decision Tree), respectively. Furthermore, we adopt a Top-K metric to examine the number of at-risk students that the model is able to identify with high precision during each week. Finally, the model output is interpreted through a model-agnostic interpretation approach to support instructors to make informed recommendations for students’ learning. The experimental results demonstrate the capability and interpretability of our model in identifying at-risk students in online learning settings. In addition to that our work also provides significant implications in building accountable machine learning pipelines that can be used to automatically generated individualized learning interventions while considering fairness between different learning groups.},

The estimation results suggest that the institutional characteristics have a significant impact on dropouts. The findings show that student–staff ratio has a positive influence on student dropout. We also find a negative association between staff quality and dropout rate. In addition, the analysis reveals the importance of contextual factors such as university accommodation in helping students to complete university education. Finally, regression also indicates a significant and positive interaction between unemployment rate and the dropout rat.},

The results of large-scale population-based studies clearly suggested that autistic children and adolescents were absent from school more often than their non-autistic peers, which partly was attributable to co-occurring conditions. Bullying also emerged as a potential risk factor. Only a few preliminary studies were available on targeted interventions, emphasizing the need for more robust studies. More research is also needed on the mechanisms leading to and maintaining school absenteeism in this group of learners. Overall, the diversity of research questions, methods, and definitions used in this body of research suggests that systematic reviews with narrow focus on a few key questions may still be premature. Lay abstract Autistic children and teenagers are, on average, absent from school more than their peers. The aim of this review was to provide an overview of the research on absence from school in autistic learners in primary and secondary school, to help guide future research. We sifted through 4632 reports and found 42 studies with a focus on school absence and autism. We looked at how, when, and where the studies were conducted. We also summarized the results and outlined how absence was measured in the studies. Absence from school may lead to problems later in life, like incomplete education and unemployment. It is therefore important to know how common this problem is among autistic learners, what the reasons may be, and what type of support they need. The studies were from high-income countries and were mainly published in the last 10 years. Studies based on school registers from the United States and the United Kingdom clearly showed that children and teenagers with autism had higher risk of school absence than those without autism. Absence was often linked to problems with mental health or additional neurodevelopmental conditions. Several studies also showed that absence in autistic children and adolescents was related to problems in school, like bullying or lack of knowledge about autism. Support programs were only evaluated in a few studies with a small number of study participants. We conclude that more research is needed to better understand why autistic learners are absent and what they need to thrive in schoo.},

 abstract = {School attendance and absenteeism are critical targets of educational policies and practices that often depend heavily on aggregated attendance/absenteeism data. School attendance/absenteeism data in aggregated form, in addition to having suspect quality and utility, minimizes individual student variation, distorts detailed and multilevel modeling, and obscures underlying causes and disparities of absenteeism. Recent advances in data analytics/mining and modeling may assist researchers and other stakeholders by evaluating large-scale data sets in more targeted ways to identify key root causes and patterns of school absenteeism in a particular community, school, or group of students. This would allow for more accurate educational policies tailored to unique local conditions and student/family circumstances. This article provides a summary of recent algorithm- and model-based efforts in this regard. Algorithm-based efforts include classification and regression tree analysis, ensemble analysis, support vector machines, receiver operating characteristic analysis, and random forests. Model-based efforts include multilevel modeling, structural equation modeling, latent class analysis, and meta-analytic modeling. We then illustrate how these efforts can enhance a full and nuanced understanding of the root, interconnected causes of absenteeism, improve early warning systems, and assist multi-tiered systems of support interventions for absenteeism.},

This analytic technique has been frequently used to evaluate the trade-offs in correct classification with misidentification of individuals who are at risk of performing poorly on a later outcome. Although useful statistically, coefficients from a multiple logistic regression can be difficult to explain to practitioners as it pertains to classification decisions. Moreover, classifications based on multivariate assessments are challenging to understand how performance on one assessment compensates for performance on another. The purpose of this article is to demonstrate and compare the use of logistic regression with classification and regression tree (CART) models in the identification of students who are at risk of reading comprehension difficulties. Data consisted of 986 Grade 1 students and 887 Grade 2 students who were administered a screening assessment at the middle of the school year as well as the 10th edition of the Stanford Achievement Test. Results indicated that CART performs comparably with logistic regression and may assist researchers and practitioners in explaining classification rules to parents and educator.},

 abstract = {Although studies have examined the effects of bullying victimization and adverse childhood experiences on health and mental health outcomes, few studies have examined bullying involvement and adverse childhood experiences as factors associated with school disengagement among children in the US. The objective of this study is to examine bullying involvement and adverse childhood experiences as factors associated with school disengagement among children in the US. Data for this study came from the 2016–2017 National Survey of Children’s Health. A sample of 45,041 children ages 6–17 years was analyzed using binary logistic regression with school disengagement as the outcome variable. Based on parent reports, we found that about one-third of the children were disengaged from school, 23% were involved in bullying, and 49.5% experienced at least one childhood adversity. Children who were victims of bullying, were bullies, or were bully-victims were more likely to be disengaged from school. Odds of school disengagement were 1.32 times higher for children with one ACE (95% CI = 1.24–1.40), 1.5 times higher for children with two ACEs (95% CI = 1.38–1.62), and 1.77 times higher for children with three or more ACEs (95% CI = 1.63–1.92). Understanding the association between bullying involvement and adverse childhood experiences as factors associated with school disengagement could help educators utilize supportive and caring relationships to engage students. Such an understanding could also help in developing proactive and preventive interventions to curb bullying in schools and make students feel safe and engaged in classrooms.},

 abstract = {Online learning has been adopted rapidly by educational institutions and organizations. Despite its many advantages, including 24/7 access, high flexibility, rich content, and low cost, online learning suffers from high dropout rates that hamper pedagogical and economic goal outcomes. Enhanced student dropout prediction tools would help providers proactively detect students at risk of leaving and identify factors that they might address to help students continue their learning experience. Therefore, this study seeks to improve student dropout predictions, with three main contributions. First, it benchmarks a recently proposed logit leaf model (LLM) algorithm against eight other algorithms, using a real-life data set of 10,554 students of a global subscription-based online learning provider. The LLM outperforms all other methods in finding a balance between predictive performance and comprehensibility. Second, a new multilevel informative visualization of the LLM adds novel benefits, relative to a standard LLM visualization. Third, this research specifies the impacts of student demographics; classroom characteristics; and academic, cognitive, and behavioral engagement variables on student dropout. In reviewing LLM segments, these results show that different insights emerge for various student segments with different learning patterns. This notable result can be used to personalize student retention campaigns.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Proposed frameworks of college and career readiness include aspects of school climate perceptions and behavioral engagement. School climate initiatives emphasize the importance of healthy learning environments; while behavioral indicators tend to be used to identify students at-risk for disengagement, established early warning systems include few, if any, behavioral indicators. A promising and useful screening mechanism that combines behavioral indicators along with school climate perceptions may enhance identification of adolescents at risk for disengagement, academic failure, and dropout, and may ultimately improve college and career readiness. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between self-reported adolescent perceptions of school climate and extant high school academic and behavioral data to create an index score which could be used as an early warning system for student disengagement. METHODS: To accomplish the stated objective, we employed structural equation modeling to estimate a multiple indicators multiple causes model using a sample of high school students (n = 5039) with and without disabilities. Extant school data included grade point average, attendance, tardies, and office discipline referrals, while school climate was measured using the Georgia Brief School Climate survey. RESULTS: Findings show evidence of a robust Adolescent Behavioral Index when controlled for disability status as those with disabilities are expected to have lower index scores indicating greater risk for school disengagement. CONCLUSION: Implications for research and practice are focused on the Adolescent Behavioral Index as a mechanism for systematic data collection that may underlie early warning systems in high schools specifically when designing college and career readiness interventions for adolescents and when identifying students who may be at risk for disengagement.},

@article{ED635021,
 abstract = {Predicting students' performance to identify which students are at risk of receiving a D/Fail/Withdraw (DFW) grade and ensuring their timely graduation is not just desirable but also necessary in most educational entities. In the US, not only is the Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) major becoming less popular among students, the graduation rate of STEM students is steadily declining. The lack of STEM graduates in the US is a serious problem that will place this country at a disadvantage as a competitor in international technological advancement. In order to secure its status as a technological leader internationally, the US institutions must be more vigilant in predicting the grades of STEM students to improve student retention in STEM fields.Using early grade prediction allows the school to monitor students' course progress and increases their chances of graduating. Predicting grades is highly beneficial for at-risk STEM students because it allows for timely pedagogical interventions that can better equip the students for success in their courses and prevent dropouts. Identifying at-risk students is a complicated problem since there are many factors to consider. Traditional approaches to analyzing and using students' data have had mixed results in identifying factors that help predict students' performance early on in the semester. Machine learning can uniquely identify patterns that other approaches cannot, making it a promising method for grade prediction that is currently available. This study uses machine learning algorithms to identify the key factors that predict which students are at risk early in the semester. The results of this study show that demographic variables such as gender, academic level, and age are of little value in predicting student success. The factors with the highest correlation to the course grade were the students' cumulative college grade point average (GPA) and the grades that the students received on the first four homework assignments of the semester. These variables are provided as input to machine learning algorithms: logistic regression, decision tree, and random forest. Using machine learning, grades can be predicted with 80% to 97% accuracy in the first two to four weeks of the semester, which allows the university to intervene early on.

 abstract = {Emphasis in school dropout literature has shifted from exploring wide-ranging causes of dropping out to soliciting a smaller number of predictive indicators to identify students at increased risk for dropping out. However, much of the past decade's Early Warning research excludes indicators that do not add to the predictive nature of the model even if they might inform intervention. Considering this shift and the relative infancy of Early Warning research, this paper presents a critical systematic review of the literature surrounding dropout and Early Warning System(s) (EWS). Through a focus and evaluation of student-level indicators, we present an argument of how an effective EWS can bridge the gap between the prediction of dropout events and underlying causes, while providing actionable information for schools to intervene. Finally, we present preliminary data that demonstrate the potential of elementary-level student-level indicators as an avenue for shifting the focus of EWS from student identification to meaningful prediction and intervention. The results show how the student-level indicators explored in this paper can effectively identify students at these grade levels who are on- and off-track to graduation. We discuss the implications of evidence warranting the position that dropping out of school can be predicted as early as the elementary grade levels and its potential to drive future research in this area.},

 abstract = {Background: Research shows that educators can identify half of future high school dropouts as early as Grade 6--and three quarters or more of future dropouts by Grade 9--by monitoring readily available data on attendance, behavior, and course performance. These data have come to be known as the ABCs of dropout prevention, and the measures are some of the more commonly used early warning indicators. Purpose: Developing and deploying an early warning indicator system (EWIS) is a complex endeavor for school districts, especially smaller districts without access to a large internal research team or experience implementing similar data-oriented initiatives at scale. In this chapter, we describe four key considerations that school districts and others should take account of when designing an EWIS: building broad consensus on the purpose of the system, planning around system design and data availability, validating indicators and setting thresholds, and implementing and monitoring the system. Research Design: This article is based on a review of the relevant literature on designing EWISs and our experiences. We have partnered with multiple districts and states in recent years and advised these organizations on early warning indicator selection, as well as system development. References to the literature are noted where applicable. The omission of references indicates that that portion of the text is based on our experiences working directly with districts and states. Conclusions/Recommendations: Developing early warning indicators--and an EWIS--is a complex technical and human undertaking, akin to implementing a large districtwide initiative at scale. Districts of any size are well served by thinking carefully about the process and going slowly, if needed, to ensure they get the details right. Planning the system and building consensus for implementation, choosing indicators that are right for the district context, and validating and setting the right thresholds for those indicators are essential for building widespread leadership, staff, and community support for the EWIS, as well as developing the conditions for effective implementation and use.},

@article{EJ1294051,
 abstract = {Background/Context: Emerging experiences suggest that research-practice partnerships (RPPs) can benefit both research and practice. As researchers and practitioners become part of the same social network, they also can become trusted sources of information for one another. By modeling the research use process, practitioners can incorporate what they learn into their own research acquisition and interpretation processes and researchers can gain a better understanding of how their work can be designed and conducted so that it is directly relevant to practice. Purpose/Focus of the Study: Prior literature on research-practice partnerships has identified common challenges of these partnerships such as turnover, trust, common language, and complex systems. The study follows a grounded theory approach to better understand challenges and dynamics within research-practice partnerships. Setting: The study included members of eight research-practice partnerships including two focused primarily on the use of early warning indicators to reduce high school dropout. Partnerships were diverse in their location and maturity. Five partnerships were located in the Midwest, one partnership was located in the South, and two partnerships were located in New England. Half of the partnerships were less than two years old at the time of the interviews, and the oldest partnership was 8 years old. Research Design: Using a grounded theory approach to better understand challenges and dynamics within RPPs, we analyzed qualitative interview data inductively to identify common themes discussed by respondents. Data Collection and Analysis: The study team conducted telephone interviews with two researchers and two practitioners from eight RPPs, for a total of 31 interviews -- one researcher was interviewed for two different partnerships. The team used semi-structured interview protocols aligned to the four research questions. In analyzing the interview data, we identified themes, categories, and theories that emerged from the data and confirmed or refuted our initial impressions. Findings: Researchers and practitioners across partnerships shared ten strategies used to address challenges faced by research practice partnerships. 1. Engaging in mutually responsive, transparent communication about partnership activities was a common strategy for ensuring partnership trust, building a common language, and preventing turnover. 2.Finding opportunities for human connection within the partnership is instrumental to developing trust. 3. Researchers and practitioners described bidirectional efforts to build shared understanding of language used in their respective contexts, including research methodologies and locally specific terminology employed by practitioners. 4. A high number of researchers and practitioners mentioned heightened consciousness of the use of language and ongoing efforts to check for understanding throughout the life of the partnership. 5. Overall, approximately half of the respondents highlighted the power of one or more partnership members with varied experiences in both research and practical content to bridge those worlds and make meaning for others. 6. To tackle the challenge of working in and across educational systems, respondents most-commonly mentioned the importance of having a diverse partnership composition or ensuring that there is representation of individuals from various levels and layers of the system. 7. In addition to bringing together a group of partnership members with a wide range of content knowledge, several respondents also noted the strategy of leveraging partnership "boundary spanners"--specific individuals with knowledge of multiple levels of the system who can help shape activities at the partnership level to help move the partnership's work across the system. 8. The strategy most frequently mentioned to engage members and ultimately cultivate trust and/or prevent turnover was to create authentic roles for practitioners and value practitioner voice. 9. Also mentioned by both researchers and practitioners was a relevant research agenda or focal topic concerning the development of trust, development of a common language, and prevention of member turnover. 10. Another commonly mentioned strategy for mitigating turnover was selecting natural replacements to fill positions that had turned over. Conclusions/Recommendations: This study provides guidance for researchers facilitating RPPs to reflect on the ways in which they are working with their partners to implement identified strategies. Practitioners participating in RPPs may want to provide their research partners with feedback on the extent to which they perceive these strategies being implemented in their partnership. Finally, researchers interested in building the literature on RPP processes and strategies might do so by conducting similar interviews with a larger sample of RPPs to further develop a typology of strategies for enhancing RPP efforts related to building trust and overcoming challenges. These strategies could be codified and used to train future researchers and practitioners who want to engage in or improve existing RPPs.},

@article{EJ1308233,
 abstract = {Aim/Purpose: One of the main objectives of higher education institutions is to provide a high-quality education to their students and reduce dropout rates. This can be achieved by predicting students' academic achievement early using Educational Data Mining (EDM). This study aims to predict students' final grades and identify honorary students at an early stage. Background: EDM research has emerged as an exciting research area, which can unfold valuable knowledge from educational databases for many purposes, such as identifying the dropouts and students who need special attention and discovering honorary students for allocating scholarships. Methodology: In this work, we have collected 300 undergraduate students' records from three departments of a Computer and Information Science College at a university located in Saudi Arabia. We compared the performance of six data mining methods in predicting academic achievement. Those methods are C4.5, Simple CART, LADTree, Naïve Bayes, Bayes Net with ADTree, and Random Forest. Contribution: We tested the significance of correlation attribute predictors using four different methods. We found 9 out of 18 proposed features with a significant correlation for predicting students' academic achievement after their 4th semester. Those features are student GPA during the first four semesters, the number of failed courses during the first four semesters, and the grades of three core courses, i.e., database fundamentals, programming language (1), and computer network fundamentals. Findings: The empirical results show the following: (i) the main features that can predict students' academic achievement are the student GPA during the first four semesters, the number of failed courses during the first four semesters, and the grades of three core courses; (ii) Naïve Bayes classifier performed better than Tree-based Models in predicting students' academic achievement in general, however, Random Forest outperformed Naïve Bayes in predicting honorary students; (iii) English language skills do not play an essential role in students' success at the college of Computer and Information Sciences; and (iv) studying an orientation year does not contribute to students' success. Recommendations for Practitioners: We would recommend instructors to consider using EDM in predicting students' academic achievement and benefit from that in customizing students' learning experience based on their different needs. Recommendation for Researchers: We would highly endorse that researchers apply more EDM studies across various universities and compare between them. For example, future research could investigate the effects of offering tutoring sessions for students who fail core courses in their first semesters, examine the role of language skills in social science programs, and examine the role of the orientation year in other programs. Impact on Society: The prediction of academic performance can help both teachers and students in many ways. It also enables the early discovery of honorary students. Thus, well-deserved opportunities can be offered; for example, scholarships, internships, and workshops. It can also help identify students who require special attention to take an appropriate intervention at the earliest stage possible. Moreover, instructors can be aware of each student's capability and customize the teaching tasks based on students' needs. Future Research: For future work, the experiment can be repeated with a larger dataset. It could also be extended with more distinctive attributes to reach more accurate results that are useful for improving the students' learning outcomes. Moreover, experiments could be done using other data mining algorithms to get a broader approach and more valuable and accurate outputs.},

 abstract = {The need for a knowledge-based society has perpetuated an increasing demand for higher education around the globe. Recently, there has been an increase in the demand for Computer Science professionals due to the rise in the use of ICT in the business, health and education sector. The enrollment numbers in Computer Science undergraduate programmes are usually high, but unfortunately, many of these students drop out from or abscond these programmes, leading to a shortage of Computer Science professionals in the job market. One way to diminish if not completely eradicate this problem is to identify students who are at risk of dropping out and provide them with special intervention programmes that will help them to remain in their programmes till graduation. In this paper, data mining techniques were used to build predictive models that can identify student dropout in Computer Science programmes, more specifically focusing on freshmen attrition since a significant number of dropout occurs in the first year of university studies. The predictive models were built for three stages of the first academic year using five classification algorithms which were Random Forest, Decision Tree, Naïve Bayes, Logistic Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbour. The models used past five years of institutional data stored in university's repositories. Results show that the Naïve Bayes model performed better in stage 1 with an AUC of 0.6132 but in stages 2 and 3, the overall performance of the Logsitic Regression models were better with an AUC of 0.7523 and 0.8902, respectively.},

 abstract = {Although the number of students in higher education institutions (HEIs) has increased over the past two decades, it is far from assured that all students will gain an academic degree. To that end, institutional analytics (IA) can offer insights to support strategic planning with the aim of reducing dropout and therefore of minimizing its negative impact (e.g., on students, academic stakeholders, and institutions). However, it is not clear how institutional stakeholders can integrate IA in their practice to overcome academic-related issues and to offer support to students who struggle to achieve their academic goals. To address this gap, we conducted focus groups with 13 institutional stakeholders of an Estonian university. By analyzing the focus group data, we identified three main categories of factors influencing dropout from the perspective of institutional stakeholders: (1) institutional experience, (2) educational goals, and (3) personal aspects. We discuss our findings from an institutional perspective with the aim of reflecting on institutional processes, organizational structures, and facilitatory roles in the context of dropout in higher education (HE). We argue that IA can provide insights into students' institutional experience, educational goals, and personal aspects to further support decision-making on the institutional level. We envision our findings contributing to a participatory agenda for the design, implementation, and integration of IA solutions focusing on addressing dropout in HE.},

 abstract = {Dropout is one of the major problems online higher education faces. Early identification of the dropout risk level and an intervention mechanism to revert the potential risk have been proved as the key answers to solving the challenge. Predictive modeling has been extensively studied on course dropout. However, intervention practices are scarce, sometimes mixed with mechanisms focused on course failure, and commonly focused on limited interventions driven mainly by teachers' experience. This work contributes with a novel approach for identifying course dropout based on a dynamic time interval and intervening, focusing on avoiding dropout at the assessable activity level. Moreover, the system can recommend the best interval for a course and assessable activity based on artificial intelligence techniques to help teachers in this challenging task. The system has been tested on a fully online first-year course with 581 participants from 957 enrolled learners of different degrees from the Faculty of Economics and Business at the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya. Results confirm that interventions aimed at goal setting on the ongoing assessable activity significantly reduce dropout issues and increase engagement within the course. Additionally, the work explores the differences between identification mechanisms for course dropout and failure aiming to distinguish them as different problems that learners may face.},

 abstract = {Online learning has become more popular in higher education since it adds convenience and flexibility to students' schedule. But, it has faced difficulties in the retention of the continuity of students and ensure continual growth in course. Dropout is a concerning factor in online course continuity. Therefore, it has sparked great interest among educators and researchers to offer many models and strategies to reduce online course students' dropout by analyzing students' behavior and their individual and academic information. However, online education platforms still face challenges of high dropout rate and the difficulty of accurate prediction to reduce it. The key aim of the present study is to construct a predictive model to early predict students who are at-risk of dropout. This model is useful to the course instructors to make effective and timely interventions. We have noticed that dropout prediction is basically a sequence labeling or time series prediction problem. For these reasons, we proposed two models; the Logistic Regression by adding a regularization term and the Input-Output Hidden Markov Model (IOHMM). Results showed that the proposed models achieved an accuracy of 84% compared to the baseline of Machine Learning Models for prediction of the students at-risk of dropping out.},

 abstract = {School dropout is a structural problem which permanently penalizes students and society in areas such as low qualification jobs, higher poverty levels and lower life expectancy, lower pensions, and higher economic burden for governments. Given these high consequences and the surge of the problem due to COVID-19 pandemic, in this paper we propose a methodology to design, develop, and evaluate a machine learning model for predicting dropout in school systems. In this methodology, we introduce necessary steps to develop a robust model to estimate the individual risk of each student to drop out of school. As advancement from previous research, this proposal focuses on analyzing individual trajectories of students, incorporating the student situation at school, family, among other levels, changes, and accumulation of events to predict dropout. Following the methodology, we create a model for the Chilean case based on data available mostly through administrative data from the educational system, and according to known factors associated with school dropout. Our results are better than those from previous research with a relevant sample size, with a predictive capability 20% higher for the actual dropout cases. Also, in contrast to previous work, the including non-individual dimensions results in a substantive contribution to the prediction of leaving school. We also illustrate applications of the model for Chilean case to support public policy decision making such as profiling schools for qualitative studies of pedagogic practices, profiling students' dropout trajectories and simulating scenarios.},

 abstract = {In recent years, the rapid growth of Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) has attracted much attention for related research. Besides, one of the main challenges in MOOCs is the high dropout or low completion rate. Early dropout prediction algorithms aim the educational institutes to retain the students for the related course. There are several methods for identification of the resigning students. These methods are often based on supervised machine learning, and require student activity records to train and create a prediction model based on the features extracted from the raw data. The performance of graph-based algorithms in various applications to discover the strong or weak relationships between entities using limited data encouraged us to turn to these algorithms for this problem. Objective of this paper is proposing a novel method with low complexity, negative link prediction algorithm, for the first time, utilizing only network topological data for dropout prediction. The idea is based on the assumption that entities with similar network structures are more likely to establish or remove a relation. Therefore, we first convert the data into a graph, mapping entities (students and courses) to nodes and relationships (enrollment data) to links. Then we use graph-based algorithms to predict students' dropout, utilizing just enrollment data. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves significant performance compared to baseline ones. However, we test the supervised link prediction idea, and show the competitive and promising results in this case as well. Finally, we present important future research directions to improve the results.},

 abstract = {Course dropout is a concern in online higher education, mainly in first-year courses when different factors negatively influence the learners' engagement leading to an unsuccessful outcome or even dropping out from the university. The early identification of such potential at-risk learners is the key to intervening and trying to help them before they decide to drop out. This article focuses on this challenging problem by providing a predictive dropout model with distinctive characteristics from previous approaches. First, the identification is in real time by providing a daily dropout prediction. Second, a temporal window of variable size is defined to evaluate the likelihood of being a dropout learner at the activity level. Such contributions will serve as a basis for designing and applying intervention mechanisms to reverse the course dropout at-risk situation. The predictive model and the temporal window have been evaluated on data from an authentic online learning setting in two first-year undergraduate courses. We show the accuracy of correctly identifying at-risk learners within activities and the model performance to detect actual course dropout learners.},

 abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to provide a parsimonious but rigorous model to assist decision-makers to determine critical factors which can lead to higher graduation rates amongst higher education institution (HEI) participants. It predicts the odds of dropout amongst university students, using HEI data from a developing country. This is used as a basis for a Student Retention Predictive (SRP) Model to inform HEI administrators about predicted risks of attrition amongst cohorts. Design/methodology/approach: A classification tool, the Logistic Regression Model, is fitted to the data set for a particular HEI in a developing country. The model is used to predict significant factors for student dropout and to create a base model for predicted risks by various student demographic variables. Findings: To reduce dropout and to ensure higher graduation rates, the model suggests that variables such as age group, faculty, academic standing and cumulative GPA are significant. These indicative results can drive intervention strategies to improve student retention in HEIs and lessen the gap between graduates and non-graduates, with the goal of reducing socio-economic inequalities in society. Originality/value: This research employs risk bands (low, medium and high) to classify students at risk of attrition or drop out. This provides invaluable insights to HEI administrators in the development of intervention strategies to reduce dropout and increase graduation rates to impact the wider public policy issue of socio-economic inequities.},

 abstract = {In recent years, initiatives and the resulting application of precision education have been applied with increasing frequency in Taiwan; the accompanying discourse has focused on identifying potential applications for artificial intelligence and how to use learning analytics to improve teaching quality and learning outcomes. This study used the established dropout risk prediction model to improve student learning effectiveness. The model was based on the academic portfolios of past students and built with statistical learning and deep learning methods. This study used this model to predict the dropout risk of 2205 freshmen enrolled in the fall semester of 2018 (graduated in June 2022) in the field of sustainable education. A total of 176 students with a dropout risk of more than 20% were considered high-risk students. After tracking and the appropriate guidance, the dropout risk of 91 students fell from > 20% to < 20%. To discuss the results from the perspective of gender and financial disadvantages, the improvement rate of the dropout risk for male students was 10.2% better than that of female students at 2.9%. The improvement rate in dropout risk for students with disadvantageous financial situations was as high as 12.0%, surpassing the 5.9% rate among general students. Overall, the dropout rate in the second year of the 2018 freshman cohort was lower than that of the 2016 and 2017 freshman cohorts. A predictive model established by statistical learning and deep learning methods was used as a tool to promote precision education, accurately and efficiently identifying students who are having difficulty learning, as well as leading to a better understanding of AI (artificial intelligence) in smart learning for sustainable education.},

 abstract = {In this paper, we present an extended evaluation of a course recommender system designed to support students who struggle in the first semesters of their studies and are at risk of dropping out. The system, which was developed in earlier work using a student-centered design, is based on the explainable k-nearest neighbor algorithm and recommends a set of courses that have been passed by the majority of successful neighbors, that is, students who graduated from the study program. In terms of the number of recommended courses, we found a discrepancy between the number of courses that struggling students are recommended to take and the actual number of courses they take. This indicates that there may be an alternative path that these students could consider. However, the recommended courses align well with the courses taken by students who successfully graduated. This suggests that even students who are performing well could still benefit from the course recommender system designed for at-risk students. In the present work, we investigate a second type of success--a specific minimum number of courses passed--and compare the results with our first approach from previous work. With the second type, the information about success might be already available after one semester instead of after graduation which allows faster growth of the database and faster response to curricular changes. The evaluation of three different study programs in terms of dropout risk reduction and recommendation quality suggests that course recommendations based on students passing at least three courses in the following semester can be an alternative to guide students on a successful path.},

 abstract = {This study presents the development of a novel automated system, Rapid Analysis and Detection of At-risk students with Artificial intelligence-based Response (RADAR), that utilizes explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to identify students who are at risk of falling behind or dropping out of school. The system integrates various features, including learners' personality, previous academic performance, current academic concepts progress, and soft skills. Machine learning algorithms are utilized to analyze the combination of data and identify patterns that predict a student's likelihood of falling behind. The proposed RADAR system employs a multi-modal approach, considering the learner's features. The system is trained on a dataset of students from a school district, where the data is collected and preprocessed accordingly. The feature selection algorithm is applied to identify the most relevant features that can accurately predict students at-risk of falling behind or dropping out. The pilot study establishes the framework of the system and examines the implementation implications. The results of this study indicate that the RADAR system achieves high accuracy in identifying at-risk students. Furthermore, the system effectively employs the identified features to predict students' performance in a continuous manner, enabling advisors, administrators, and students to take proactive measures to maintain high academic progress levels. The system is designed to provide an automated and continuous monitoring of the students' performance, and to notify the relevant parties in case of any deviations. The proposed system represents an innovative approach to using XAI for the detection and support of at-risk students, enabling educators to take timely actions. The results of this study demonstrate the potential of the RADAR system to improve the support and guidance provided to at-risk students, and to ultimately improve their academic outcomes.},

First, we describe reasons for the growing interest in the construct of engagement in research, policy, and practice. Next, we present demographic and developmental differences in engagement and provide a summary of the theoretical models and conceptual issues related to the engagement construct. We then describe why engagement is a key locus for interventions that aim to reduce dropout rates, increase achievement, and help students to develop the skills that are necessary to compete for the jobs of future.

 abstract = {The dropout of university students is one of the topics of a broad interest in higher education institutions and government education departments. Recent changes in education methods, socio-economic conditions, and the growing limitations of face to face interactions make it necessary to have tools that allow us to consider a broad set of factors related to the dropout phenomenon. The objective of this article is to show the implementation results of a predictive information system (IS) for the prevention of university dropout in a higher education institution. The system allows the calculation of the risk of dropout per student and uses an alert generation procedure to coordinate interventions. The platform allowed measuring the impact of the intervention strategies on the permanence of the students. Likewise, it made possible the reorganization of the intervention process towards the students, prioritizing according to the risk level.},

 abstract = {Cognitive control processes support goal-directed behavior and flexible adaptation in response to changing contexts. These processes are sensitive to a broad range of biological and environmental impacts, including physical and mental health conditions, substance use, lifestyle choices, as well as adverse personal and social circumstances. Cognitive control processes and associated prefrontal cortical areas are the last to fully mature during young adulthood, and most sensitive to the effects of age in late life. Moreover, cognitive control ability in early life is predictive of adaptive or maladaptive outcomes in adulthood. The sensitivity of cognitive control processes to many of the influences that impact our lives makes them a prime candidate as an early warning system of the need for assessment and intervention to prevent cascading effects of cognitive decline across multiple contexts and areas of functioning. In this paper, we briefly review current approaches to assessing cognitive control literature, with a particular focus on the task-switching paradigm. We briefly review current designs and measures, its link to prefrontal cortical function and its sensitivity to a broad range of clinical conditions and lifestyle variations. We conclude that the task-switching paradigm may provide a sensitive tool for assessing cognitive control ability across the lifespan, as well as detecting early subtle changes in ability that may be predictive of future negative outcomes and signal the need for intervention. We briefly discuss how the task-switching paradigm could be developed into a powerful “canary in the coalmine.”},

 abstract = {The present study aims to identify the trajectory pattern of truancy from early adolescence in South Korea and to examine the association of each trajectory pattern with social-ecological based factors. The participants were 2378 elementary school students who completed the Korean Welfare Panel Study at five time points that covered from late elementary school to the first year of high school. Latent Class Growth Analysis identified three truancy trajectories: truancy increasing group, truancy decreasing group, and non-truant group. At the individual level, the truancy increasing group was more likely to be composed of males and have higher levels of game use than non-truants. Both the truancy increasing and decreasing group were more likely to have higher levels of aggression and depression than the non-truant group. At the family level, non-traditional structures and poor parental affection were more associated with the truancy increasing group. At the peer/friend level, the truancy increasing group was more likely to have poor peer relations than the non-truant group or truancy decreasing group, and more likely to have associations with delinquent peers than the non-truant group. At the school level, the truancy increasing group reported being less likely to have positive relations with teachers, to engage in school activities, and to follow school rules than the non-truant group. These findings could allow for more specific and targeted interventions designed to meet the needs and risk factors associated with the different typologies of truants in South Korea.},

 abstract = {The dropout rate in universities is a widely studied issue that concerns both universities and public organizations. Most studies focus on quantifying the phenomenon and identifying the variables involved. This paper uses a multidisciplinary approach to parameterize the factors that define the entry profile of undergraduates at the national level in Spain in collaboration with three universities in different regions and with different disciplines. The aim is to reduce the dropout rate in the first year of study towards a degree. The research questions focus on the weighting of personal variables about students by tutors and whether there are differences in the weighting systems for the main variables as differentiated by discipline, university and/or region. The document is organized to describe the method and context of the study, present the main results, show the application of the survey instrument in a case study, and provide conclusions. The method is based on the two fundamental factors, including the influence of certain student characteristics at matriculation and the importance of a positive experience in the first year of the degree. The study is focused on two elements that inspire the current proposal: the need to identify and rapidly detect students who, due to their entry characteristics, are at a greater risk of dropout and the importance of guaranteeing a good start in the first year of the degree. The study uses a multidisciplinary approach and combines qualitative and quantitative methods to gather data. The study also uses a survey instrument that measures the risk of student dropout based on the weighting of personal variables by tutors. The results of the study have allowed us to categorize the main variables of the student profile that affect the risk of dropout and establish them as aspects to be monitored by the tutors in the first weeks. Furthermore, it has been shown that although there are no significant differences in the averages of dropout risk calculated with either global or specific weighting systems (by centre or studies), there is a tendency observed by the tutors that the weighted averages generated by disciplinary focus are closer to identifying the student's real risk of dropping out.},

 abstract = {Student dropout is a major concern in higher education, as it leads to direct economic losses and substantial social costs. Public and private institutions spend considerable resources to prevent student dropout. The efficiency and effectiveness of these investments, however, may be improved by adopting a profit-driven perspective. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for implementing student dropout prediction using data-driven methods. Extending upon profit metrics as used in business analytics, we design a novel performance measure for evaluating predictive models that is tailored to the student dropout problem and that quantifies the net savings of a retention campaign. This metric supports the identification and selection of students to optimally allocate the limited resources for preventing student dropout and to maximize the resulting savings. Experiments were performed using data from three bachelor's programs of a higher education institution containing information on dropouts and participation in a retention program, i.e., tutorials. The proposed metric allows for a better choice of prediction model and classification threshold than conventional approaches and, as a result, yields tangible savings for the institution. Finally, the presented approach and experimental results highlight pathways to design tailored student retention programs.},

 abstract = {In situations like the coronavirus pandemic, colleges and universities are forced to limit their offline and regular academic activities. Extended postponement of high-stakes exams due to health risk hereby reduces productivity and progress in later years. Several countries decided to organize the exams online. Since many other countries with large education boards had an inadequate infrastructure and insufficient resources during the emergency, education policy experts considered a solution to simultaneously protect public health and fully resume high-stakes exams -by canceling offline exam and introducing a uniform assessment process to be followed across the states and education boards. This research proposes a novel system using an AI model to accomplish the complex task of evaluating all students across education boards with maximum level of fairness and analyzes the ability to fairly appraise exam grades in the context of high-stakes examinations during SARS-CoV-2 emergency. Basically, a logistic regression classifier on top of a deep neural network is used to output predictions that are as fair as possible for all learners. The predictions of the proposed grade-awarding system are explained by the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) framework. SHAP allowed to identify the features of the students' portfolios that contributed most to the predicted grades. In the setting of an empirical analysis in one of the largest education systems in the Global South, 81.85% of learners were assigned fair scores while 3.12% of the scores were significantly smaller than the actual grades, which would have had a detrimental effect if it had been applied for real. Furthermore, SHAP allows policy-makers to debug the predictive model by identifying and measuring the importance of the factors involved in the model's final decision and removing those features that should not play a role in the model's “reasoning” process.},

 abstract = {Collaboration is considered as one of the main drivers of learning and it has been broadly studied across numerous contexts, including Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). The research on MOOCs has risen exponentially during the last years and there have been a number of works focused on studying collaboration. However, these previous studies have been restricted to the analysis of collaboration based on the forum and social interactions, without taking into account other possibilities such as the synchronicity in the interactions with the platform. Therefore, in this work we performed a case study with the goal of implementing a data-driven approach to detect and characterize collaboration in MOOCs. We applied an algorithm to detect synchronicity links based on their submission times to quizzes as an indicator of collaboration, and applied it to data from two large Coursera MOOCs. We found three different profiles of user accounts, that were grouped in couples and larger communities exhibiting different types of associations between user accounts. The characterization of these user accounts suggested that some of them might represent genuine online learning collaborative associations, but that in other cases dishonest behaviors such as free-riding or multiple account cheating might be present. These findings call for additional research on the study of the kind of collaborations that can emerge in online settings.},

However, the study is intended to discuss the flood intensity and recurrence trend by analyzing historical data. The study also focuses on the indigenous coping techniques of flood-affected people. To access the intensity of the flood, Flood Intensity Index (FII) method was applied. To analyze the flood recurrence and peak, Weibull’s and Gumbel’s distribution method was applied for a period of 36 years (1985–2020), and for ranking the coping strategies, Weight Average Index (WAI) was applied. The research result indicates that the study area poses a higher degree of flood risk (0.642), especially from May to October month. Over the study period, 17 floods took place in the area. Among these, floods in 1988 and 1998 were of very high magnitude, with Flood Intensity Index scores of 24.64 and 31.68, respectively. However, affected people apply different types of indigenous preventive, surviving, and recovering techniques to minimize the adverse effects of floods.},

Covering 144,540 instances from 2018 to 2022, the study integrates diverse datasets to compare the accuracy of models based on longitudinal, semester-wise, and gender-specific datasets. The demographic, academic, and online metrics identified significant dropout indicators, including age (particularly when binned), residential area, specific occupations, GPA, and LMS log metrics, using a stepwise backward elimination process. The study revealed that, despite societal changes, recent data from the last four semesters can be effectively used for stable prediction training. Gender-based analysis showed different factors influencing dropout risk for males and females. The Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM) algorithm excelled in prediction accuracy, with the ROC-AUC metric affirming its superiority. However, logistic regression also showed its competitive performance and offered in-depth interpretation. In South Korea's distinct educational setting, merging advanced algorithms like LGBM with the interpretive strength of logistic regression is key for effective student support strategies.},

The increasing adoption of CMS for online and mixed-learning environments highlights their importance. However, inherent limitations in conventional CMS platforms hinder personalized student guidance and effective identification of academic challenges. Addressing this crucial gap, our study introduces an AI Student Success Predictor empowered by advanced machine learning algorithms, capable of automating grading processes, predicting student risks, and forecasting retention or dropout outcomes. Central to our approach is the creation of a standardized dataset, meticulously curated by integrating student information from diverse relational databases. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) feature learning block is developed the extract the hidden patterns in the student data. This classification model stands as an ensemble masterpiece, incorporating SVM, Random Forest, and KNN classifiers, subsequently refined by a Bayesian averaging model. The proposed ensemble model shows the ability to predict the student grades, retention, and risk levels of dropout. The accuracy achieved by the proposed model is assessed using test data, culminating in a commendable 93% accuracy for student grade prediction and student risk prediction, and a solid 92% accuracy for the complex domain of retention and dropout forecasting. The proposed AI system seamlessly integrates with existing CMS infrastructure, enabling real-time data retrieval and swift, accurate predictions, enhancing academic decision-making efficiency.

Multiple student-level factors were associated with increased likelihood of earning a diploma in the fifth year (e.g. special education eligibility, passing exit exams, higher attendance). Returning dropouts were less likely than persisters to earn a diploma in year five. In addition, the type and composition of the school a student attended affected the likelihood that a student would earn a diploma in year five. We also report population-level rates of participation in the workforce and postsecondary enrollment for fifth-year graduates and non-graduates. Fifth-year graduates outperformed non-graduates in both categories. Our findings provide insight into near term outcomes for students in a fifth-year of high school and suggest key factors that can be used for early identification and targeting services towards this under-researched and under-served population.},

 abstract = {High levels of school dropout are a major burden on the educational and
professional development of a country's inhabitants. A country's
prosperity depends, among other factors, on its ability to produce
higher education graduates capable of moving a country forward. To
alleviate the dropout problem, more and more institutions are turning to
the possibilities that artificial intelligence can provide to predict
dropout as early as possible. The difficulty of accessing personal data
and privacy issues that it entails force the institutions to rely on the
Academic Data of their students to create accurate and reliable
predictive systems. This work focuses on creating the best possible
predictive model based solely on academic data, and accordingly, its
capacity to infer knowledge must be maximised. Thus, Feature Engineering
and Instance Engineering techniques such as dealing with redundancy,
significance of the features, correlation, cardinality features, missing
values, creation or elimination of features, data fusion, removal of
unuseful instances, binning, resampling, normalisation, or encoding are
applied in detail before the construction of well-known models such as
Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine along with
an Ensemble of them at different stages: prior to enrolment, at the end
of the first semester, at the end of the second semester, at the end of
the third semester, and at the end of the fourth semester. Through the
construction of these predictive models that serve as inputs to a
decision support system, the application of effective dropout prevention
policies can be applied.},

 abstract = {IntroductionThere is a global effort to address the school dropout
phenomenon. The urgency to act on it comes from the harmful evidence
that school dropout has on societal and individual levels. Early Warning
Systems (EWS) for school dropout at-risk student identification have
been developed to anticipate and help schools have a better chance of
acting on it. However, several studies point to a doubt that Correct EWS
may come too late because they use only publicly available and general
student and school information. We hypothesize that having a tool to
assess more subjective and inter-relational factors would help
anticipate where and when to act to prevent school dropout. This study
aimed to develop a multidimensional measure for assessing relational
factors for predicting school dropout (SD) risk in the Brazilian
context. MethodsWe performed several procedures, including (a) the
specialized literature review, (b) the item development of the
Relational Factors for the Risk of School Dropout Scale (IAFREE in
Portuguese), (c) the content validity analysis, (d) a pilot study, and
(e) the administration of the IAFREE to a large Brazilian sample of high
school and middle school students (N = 15,924). ResultsAfter the
theoretical steps, we found content validity for five relational
dimensions for SD (Student-School, Student-School Professionals,
Student-Family, Student-Community, and Student-Student) that include 12
facets of risk factors. At the empirical stage, confirmatory analysis
corroborated the proposed theoretical model with 12 first-order risk
factors and 5 s-order dimensions (36 items). Further, through the Item
Response Theory analysis, we assessed the individual item parameters of
the items, providing a brief measure without losing psychometric quality
(IAFREE-12). DiscussionWe discuss how this model may fill gaps in
Correct EWS models and how to advance it. The IAFREE is a good measure
for scholars investigating the risk of SD. These results are important
for implementing an early warning system for SD that looks into the
complexity of the school dropout phenomenon.},

 abstract = {PurposeThis paper aims to provide a parsimonious but rigorous model to
assist decision-makers to determine critical factors which can lead to
higher graduation rates amongst higher education institution (HEI)
participants. It predicts the odds of dropout amongst university
students, using HEI data from a developing country. This is used as a
basis for a Student Retention Predictive (SRP) Model to inform HEI
administrators about predicted risks of attrition amongst
cohorts.Design/methodology/approachA classification tool, the Logistic
Regression Model, is fitted to the data set for a particular HEI in a
developing country. The model is used to predict significant factors for
student dropout and to create a base model for predicted risks by
various student demographic variables.FindingsTo reduce dropout and to
ensure higher graduation rates, the model suggests that variables such
as age group, faculty, academic standing and cumulative GPA are
significant. These indicative results can drive intervention strategies
to improve student retention in HEIs and lessen the gap between
graduates and non-graduates, with the goal of reducing socio-economic
inequalities in society.Originality/valueThis research employs risk
bands (low, medium and high) to classify students at risk of attrition
or drop out. This provides invaluable insights to HEI administrators in
the development of intervention strategies to reduce dropout and
increase graduation rates to impact the wider public policy issue of
socio-economic inequities.},

 abstract = {Predicting university dropout is crucial. Identifying at-risk students
can inform dropout prevention policies, safeguarding the nation's
resources and mitigating the long-term deterioration of human capital.
In contrast to previous literature, this study prioritizes predicting
student dropout rather than delving into causal mechanisms. This study
leverages administrative data encompassing the entire population of
Italian students enrolled in bachelor's degree programs for the academic
year 2013-2014. Our quantitative findings indicate that machine learning
algorithms exhibit significant predictive capabilities, specifically
random forest and gradient boosting machines, underscoring their
potential as early warning indicators. Feature importance analysis
emphasizes the role of students' first-year academic performance in
dropout prediction. Furthermore, our findings provide additional
evidence regarding the influence of family income, high school grades,
and high school type. The adoption of these novel predictive tools can
facilitate the targeted implementation of policies aimed at mitigating
this phenomenon.},

 abstract = {PurposeThis study aimed to use enrollment information including
demographic, family background and financial status, which can be
gathered before the first semester starts, to construct early prediction
models (EPMs) and extract crucial factors associated with first-year
student dropout probability.Design/methodology/approachThe real-world
samples comprised the enrolled records of 2,412 first-year students of a
private university (UNI) in Taiwan. This work utilized decision trees
(DT), multilayer perceptron (MLP) and logistic regression (LR)
algorithms for constructing EPMs; under-sampling, random oversampling
and synthetic minority over sampling technique (SMOTE) methods for
solving data imbalance problems; accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score,
receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve and area under ROC curve
(AUC) for evaluating constructed EPMs.FindingsDT outperformed MLP and LR
with accuracy (97.59\%), precision (98\%), recall (97\%), F1\_score
(97\%), and ROC-AUC (98\%). The top-ranking factors comprised ``student
loan,{''} ``dad occupations,{''} ``mom educational level,{''}
``department,{''} ``mom occupations,{''} ``admission type,{''} ``school
fee waiver{''} and ``main sources of living.{''}Practical
implicationsThis work only used enrollment information to identify
dropout students and crucial factors associated with dropout probability
as soon as students enter universities. The extracted rules could be
utilized to enhance student retention.Originality/valueAlthough
first-year student dropouts have gained non-stop attention from
researchers in educational practices and theories worldwide, diverse
previous studies utilized while-and/or post-semester factors, and/or
questionnaires for predicting. These methods failed to offer
universities early warning systems (EWS) and/or assist them in providing
in-time assistance to dropouts, who face economic difficulties. This
work provided universities with an EWS and extracted rules for early
dropout prevention and intervention.},

 abstract = {Student dropout and its economic and social consequences are significant
issues in developing countries. Students who drop out experience reduced
employment prospects and encounter social stigma. While early dropout
prediction can assist in mitigating the consequences, it remains a
considerable challenge. The present research employed a data mining
approach to predict dropout of public health master -level students in
Saudi Arabia, a developing nation that has invested considerable
resources to promote higher education. The research model focused on
three fundamental determinants of students' dropout: individual,
institutional, and academic. The study analysis on a dataset of 150
students revealed that all three determinants predicted student dropout.
The results indicated that students with low academic performance who
received an academic warning were likelier to drop out. Freshmen with
poor academic achievement were particularly at risk of dropping out of
college. Students between 31 and 36 years old who attended technical
courses as a subject specialization could also dropout. The research
contributes to the literature by suggesting that universities should
consider these individual, institutional, and academic determinants to
develop their dropout prevention strategies. This study has
ramifications for university administrators in developing nations, such
as Saudi Arabia, who can establish dropout prevention programs based on
the determinants revealed in this study.},
