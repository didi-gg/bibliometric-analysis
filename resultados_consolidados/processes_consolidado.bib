The key challenges are the degree of energy transferred to devices, like automated vehicles and robotic equipment, and lack of belief in intelligent decision-making, which may overrule the system in the event of misperceptions of automated decisions. This paper presents an efficient Logistics Management Framework Using Deep Learning (eLMF-DL) to implement the computer vision-assisted Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) in the logistic management sector. With a hybrid CNN-LSTM network, eLMF-DL implements a single-stage or one-step convergence optimum decision-support design model that intelligently combines production maximization and demand forecasting. The architecture with the integration of convolutional neural network and long short-term memory network models the machine dynamics and relationships in assorted diverse logistics services demand. To determine uncertainties through dynamic delivery and optimal decisions on allocating logistical service power, the eLMF-DL results in the highest performance.},

 abstract = {This paper proposes an intelligent faculty evaluation and ranking system in a fuzzy environment, with a focus on semester-wise evaluation rather than annual evaluation. This approach is warranted because a university’s academic goals may vary across semesters, affecting the selection and weights of performance indicators related to teaching effectiveness, research output, and official responsibilities. To achieve this objective, the authors introduce the concept of N-framed plithogenic hypersoft set (PHSS), where N represents the number of frames or semesters. Three types of N-framed PHSS are introduced, and an efficient rank reversal-free multi-criteria decision-making technique, namely NR-TOPSIS, is extended by embedding N-framed PHSS in the algorithm of NR-TOPSIS, termed as ENR-TOPSIS. The modified algorithm is capable of extracting data from a source file and producing the desired results. The procedure is implemented for faculty evaluation in a double-framed fuzzy environment, and sensitivity analysis is performed for the proposed ENR-TOPSIS. The developed framework combines intelligent systems that are adaptable and contain additional characteristics, making it more versatile and increasing its accuracy and transparency, in line with SDG-4, which focuses on quality education.},

Predicting landslides is an important task to enable preventive measures to be made on time. This paper presents an analysis of univariate time-series forecasting data using an auto regressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, a generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) model, and a dynamic neural network (DNN) model. These techniques rely on the objective of the forecasting, the type of forecasted data, and whether an automatic or manual approach is to be used for forecasting. Different techniques were analyzed on 15-meter landslide sensor data. The objective of this paper is to suggest a best method among well-known models for landslide forecasting. The demonstrated result shows that a dynamic neural network model is best in class for time-series landslide forecasting. Furthermore, upon objectively evaluating the three well-known techniques, the DNN model exhibited a minimum error rate of approximately 0.01 in comparison to other implemented techniques.},

This research aims to build a publicly accessible web platform to analyze and estimate riverine flood-related damages using HAZUS and HEC-FIA damage functions. This framework will provide loss estimation for properties, business interruption, vehicles, bridges, and lives. The analysis is available for two scopes, including community and property. The community extent enables the user to explore socioeconomic flood information for several communities in the State of Iowa. In the property scope, the user can generate outcomes for the impacts of “what if” flood scenarios using user-provided data.

 abstract = {Rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis) is the primary source of natural rubber, an important raw material for industrial and non-industrial products. Smallholders account for 85% of global rubber production. This highlights the impact of increased volatility in global rubber prices on smallholders’ livelihoods. Decision support systems have been widely applied in agriculture to address complex issues and maintain profitability in crop production. They can facilitate the improvement of production through enhanced farm management practices and the development of effective smallholder-oriented policies. However, little attention has been paid to the potential role of decision support systems can play in smallholder rubber production. Here, we conduct a two-part systematic literature review to identify the factors that influence rubber production and explore how they has been incorporated in the design of existing decision support systems. We discuss the current role of decision support systems in improving smallholder rubber production and identify the limitations and opportunities for future improvements. Despite being a smallholder crop, there is a paucity of research on the influence of social and institutional factors on rubber production. To date, decision support systems in rubber production have been focused on predicting growth and yield, assessing profitability and viability, evaluating alternative farm management practices under uncertainties, and formulating policies for sustainable rubber production. We identified three main limitations: (1) the extensive data requirement; (2) the lack of incorporation of social and institutional factors; and (3) the difficulty of communicating model results to smallholders. We developed a framework and suggest improvement strategies for the development of improved decision support systems in rubber production. This framework aims to enhance the decision-making process by the key stakeholders to improve smallholder rubber production.},

 abstract = {Objective
The main objective of current investigation was to develop a predictive disease model based upon meteorological data, viz., maximum temperature, minimum temperature, rainfall, relative humidity, and wind speed to predict stripe rust severity (%).
Methods
Five years' data of stripe rust severity on three wheat varieties, namely SA-42, Sandal-73, and Barani-70, continuously cultivated for five years (2013–2017), were collected from experimental trials of Deputy Director of Agriculture Extension Layyah to develop a predictive disease model. For validation of the model, a research trial was conducted in the Research Area of the Department of Plant Pathology, Bahadar Sub-Campus Layyah, during the crop seasons of 2018–2019, following procedures similar to those utilized in five years investigation. The data on epidemiological variables used in the present investigation was collected from the Pakistan Meteorological Observatory at Karor-Layyah. To evaluate the association between meteorological factors and disease severity correlation and regression analysis was performed.
Results
All meteorological variables contributed significantly in disease development and showed 89 % variability in stripe rust severity (%). Root means square error (RMSE) and residual (%) were used to evaluate the model's predictions. Both indices were below 20, showing that the model could accurately predict the progression of disease. The regression equations of 5 years model (Y = -63.11 + 0.96x1 + 1.72x2 + 3.72x3 + 0.43x4) and 2 years model (Y = -40.2 + 1.80x1 + 1.18x2 + 2.29x3 + 0.39x4) validated each other. Scatter plots indicated that environmental factors such as maximum temperature (12.8–22.5 °C), minimum temperature (8.7–14.8 °C), relative humidity (50–85 %), and wind speed (1.3–4.5) influenced the progression of stripe rust epidemic.
Conclusion
Understanding the epidemiology of stripe rust will help us to forecast its progression, allowing wheat growers to more precisely adapt plant protection measures.},

 abstract = {The asset management phase of a building constitutes approximately 60% of its total lifecycle costs. However, significant unnecessary expenses occur in current asset management practices because of the separation of the design and construction phases from operation and maintenance and the lack of an effective building asset management system covering all types of buildings with numerous components. Asset management decision-making is inherently a process that requires the assimilation of a multitude of data, processes, and software systems. Therefore, this paper proposes an integrated decision support system for building asset management that addresses the systematization and coordination of lifecycle data. In this approach, a lifecycle work breakdown structure (WBS) for the asset management system is developed to provide a unified hierarchy to categorize and organize building assets. It is then used to develop the WBS-based integrated building lifecycle asset management model through a relational database management system (DBMS). Since building information modelling (BIM) is a rich information-based platform with large volumes of asset data needed, it is integrated with the WBS-based DBMS to achieve an effective integrated building asset management. A case study of an educational building is presented and discussed in the paper to demonstrate how the proposed automated solution is used for asset management. The research contributes to the body of knowledge by formalizing a WBS-based unified asset inventory hierarchy and mapping BIM data to the proposed hierarchy for effective asset management.},

 abstract = {Modernizing traditional power grids into smart grids represents a significant advancement in improving efficiency and sustainability within the energy sector. However, integrating renewable energy sources and the intricate network of interconnected devices has presented new challenges, especially in grid stability. Anticipating and maintaining grid stability ensures a continuous energy supply and prevents potential disruptions. This research paper explores the smart grid stability issue through machine learning. Two distinct scenarios are examined. In the first scenario, the problem is approached as a binary classification task, where grid states are categorized as stable or unstable, a well-established method for addressing grid stability. In the second scenario, an effort is made to predict continuous values that reflect the degree of grid stability. These continuous values are subsequently mapped to a conditional function, facilitating stability detection based on a predefined threshold. To address data imbalance, two balancing strategies, specifically the Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) and K-means SMOTE, are employed in each scenario. The analysis covers a range of regressors and classifiers, focusing on tree-based models, boosting algorithms, ensemble learners, and Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP). The investigation results demonstrate that combining the K-means SMOTE strategy with the CatBoost Classifier in the first scenario achieves the highest accuracy, reaching an impressive 99.6%, and an exceptional ability to detect grid instability, achieving 100% accuracy. Furthermore, the results of the second scenario are promising, with accuracy rates reaching 99.4%, thanks to the utilization of a stacking ensemble learner. Notably, this study introduces Explainable AI, a groundbreaking initiative in this field, to delve into the inner workings of the proposed models and enhance their transparency. This pioneering effort marks a significant step forward in understanding and optimizing the predictive capabilities of machine learning models applied to smart grid stability.},

 abstract = {Internet of Things (IoT) systems are becoming increasingly complex due to the heterogeneity of the elements involved and the demand for real-time processing near to the devices. In this context, Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies offer powerful capabilities to enhance IoT devices with intelligent services, resulting in the emerging field known as Artificial Internet of Things (AIoT). Operators find themselves at the center of this complexity, tasking with understanding the situation and making effective real-time decisions. Therefore human factors, especially cognitive aspects, become a significant concern. The cognitive aspects of human involvement must be framed together with intelligent artefacts, a systematic approach being necessary within the domain of Joint Cognitive Systems (JCSs). New software development methods, in the form of assistants and wizards, are essential to assist operators in becoming context-aware and reducing their technical workload related to coding or computer-oriented skills. This shift allows them to focus more effectively on the tasks or services at hands. Considering research experiences in the literature regarding the role of human workers in an AIoT environment, this book analyzes the described situation in terms of Human-Centered Cyber-Physical Systems (HCPSs) with the aim of proposing a conceptual framework for these assistance systems at the cognitive level. To validate this proposal in collaborative tasks, several illustrative examples will be presented. This chapter serves as a general introduction, outlining the different topics shaping the basic aspects of the book. Initially, we delve into generic aspects of disruptive technologies within the context of Industry 4.0 or Society 5.0. Following this, we emphasize the significance of the synergy between the Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence. Moreover, we provide a clear definition of the concept of a cognitive assistant and elucidate its relationship with human–robot teams. Lastly, we offer a detailed overview of the book's objectives and its contents.},

One of the most common MCDM methods is the Weighted Aggregated Sum Product Assessment (WASPAS) method, which combines the weighted sum (WSM) and weighted product (WPM) models for evaluating and ranking alternatives based on criteria. The WASPAS method provides a reliable and balanced approach by integrating these two methods. In this paper, we propose an innovative extension of the WASPAS method by integrating it with Decomposed Fuzzy Sets (DFS). This integration, Decomposed Fuzzy WASPAS (DF WASPAS), allows for a more comprehensive and precise capture of preferences and opinions of decision-makers, considering both optimistic and pessimistic perspectives. The DF WASPAS method is applied to a case study, where criteria weights are determined using DF AHP, and the proposed method is compared with the IF WASPAS method utilizing IF AHP for criteria weighting. The comparative analysis reveals significant differences in alternative rankings obtained using both WASPAS extensions. The proposed DF WASPAS method enhances decision-making accuracy by incorporating decision-makers’ nuanced perspectives and addressing uncertainties in complex problems.},

 abstract = {Interest in citizen participation is increasing generally. Almost all operational research (OR) is engaged with clients, but it is mainly in the areas of Soft and Community OR that wider stakeholder and citizen participation has been a significant focus. It is the involvement of citizens that is the subject of this paper. We surveyed OR literature and compiled a corpus of 62 studies, the earliest from 1970, to systematically characterize the involvement of citizens in OR processes. Our review produced three findings: First, some fields of OR have embraced citizen participation, but this is not yet a major concern outside the field of Community OR. Second, citizen participation in OR processes is often driven by a moral rationale. Third, progress in information and communication technology (ICT) enables broad participation, but traditional processes requiring physical presence can also be participatory. From these insights, we formulate research opportunities for OR. (1) OR may join Community OR's endeavor to engage with and empower citizens who have so far rarely been involved in OR processes. (2) OR may identify benefits and drawbacks of digital OR processes in empirical studies. (3) OR may determine whether involving large numbers of citizens is suitable for the societal scale. (4) OR may research building and maintaining trust. (5) OR may join efforts for data protection of participants. (6) OR may systematically report and reflect on participatory OR processes. (7) OR should continue researching the fair aggregation of individual inputs. Citizen participation in OR is topical and challenging. Pursuing these research opportunities will contribute to OR fulfilling its mandate of better decision-making in close cooperation with all affected stakeholders.},

 abstract = {Big data analytics (BDA) is a revolutionary approach for sound decision-making in organizations that can lead to remarkable changes in transforming and supporting the circular economy (CE). However, extant literature on BDA capability has paid limited attention to understanding the enabling role of data-driven insights for supporting decision-making and, consequently, enhancing CE performance. We argue that firms drive decision-making quality through data-driven insights, business intelligence and analytics (BI&A), and BDA capability. In this study, we empirically investigated the association of BDA capability with CE performance and examined the mediating role of data-driven insights in the relationship between BDA capability and decision-making. Data were collected from 109 Czech manufacturing firms, and partial least squares structural equation modeling was applied to analyze the data. The results reveal that BDA capability and BI&A are positively associated with decision-making quality. This effect is stronger when the manufacturer utilizes data-driven insights. The results demonstrate that BDA capability drives decision-making quality in organizations, and data-driven insights do not mediate this relationship. BI&A is associated with decision-making quality through data-driven insights. These findings offer important insights to managers, as they can act as a reference point for developing data-driven insights with the CE paradigm in organizations.},

Drawing upon existing literature on innovation and growth hacking, we provide a conceptual background to frame our research. To investigate this phenomenon, we employ a qualitative approach that combines the Gioia method and phenomenography. Our primary data source consists of in-depth interviews conducted with managers and practitioners who possess extensive experience in innovation management and growth hacking. Through a systematic inductive concept development approach and a multilevel analysis, we develop a novel conceptualization that illustrates how growth hacking strategies can be effectively implemented across four levels of analysis: market, organization, project, and product. Our findings highlight the importance of adopting growth hacking practices to minimize the likelihood of innovation failure in each of these domains. From a practical perspective, we offer recommendations on the strategies that companies should employ to effectively learn from the challenges associated with innovation. By leveraging these insights, firms can enhance their ability to overcome potential obstacles and optimize their innovation processes.},

 abstract = {Decision makers in organizations strive to improve the quality of their decisions. One way to improve that process is to objectify the decisions with facts. Data-driven Decision Support Systems (data-driven DSS), and more specifically business intelligence (BI) intend to achieve this. Organizations invest massively in the development of BI data-driven DSS and expect them to be adopted and to effectively support decision makers. This raises many technical and methodological challenges, especially regarding the design of BI dashboards, which can be seen as the visible tip of the BI data-driven DSS iceberg and which play a major role in the adoption of the entire system. In this paper, the dashboard content is investigated as one possible root cause for BI data-driven DSS dashboard adoption or rejection through an early empirical research. More precisely, this work is composed of three parts. In the first part, the concept of cognitive loads is studied in the context of BI dashboards and the informational, the representational and the non-informational loads are introduced. In the second part, the effects of these loads on the adoption of BI dashboards are then studied through an experiment with 167 respondents and a Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) analysis. The result is a Dashboard Adoption Model, enriching the seminal Technology Acceptance Model with new content-oriented variables to support the design of more supportive BI data-driven DSS dashboards. Finally, in the third part, a set of indicators is proposed to help dashboards designers in the monitoring of the loads of their dashboards practically.},

 abstract = {Most previous works on future market price forecasting only utilize the historical transaction data, while ignoring many other valuable factors. Recently, many research works propose multiple-source data-based predicting approaches in the stock market. Although the futures market and the stock market are very similar, the futures market still has its uniqueness. Most importantly, the subject matter of futures is usually commodity entities with prominent competing products or upstream, downstream industries, which can significantly influence the price. Therefore, it is essential to propose a future specific analysis framework by considering different factors. In this study, we constructed a Multi-source Heterogeneous Data Analysis (MHDA) method for future price prediction by integrating multiple-source information, i.e., trading data, news event data, and investor comments. Firstly, we first constructed a relation map to capture all related news events from upstream and downstream commodities and then built a future-specific sentiment dictionary to accurately quantify the sentiment impact of related news and investor comments during the feature extraction. Finally, we model the quantified multi-source heterogeneous information by an extended Hidden Markov Model to capture the underlying temporal dependency in the data. Evaluations on the data of palm oil futures from 2016.9 to 2017.9 show the effectiveness of our proposed framework.},

 abstract = {Reliable hotel cancellation prediction can help establish appropriate operational strategies for hotel management. In this sector, personal name records (PNR) data may be the most representative information source for prediction tasks. Despite the popularity of PNR, its inherent lack of availability has been commonly disregarded in the literature. Existing studies have directly input PNR into high-dimensional machine learning (ML) models to achieve cancellation predictions. Another type of model generates cancellation prediction based on the probability modeling of samples. In this study, we propose an interpretable feature interaction method to enrich the existing PNR information. Thereafter, we empirically assess the prediction performance of the two model classes. This study specifically determines whether or not the two methods can cross-fertilize each other to improve cancellation prediction. To do so, we propose a model integrating Bayesian networks (BNs) and Lasso regression for this prediction task. This study utilizes BNs for the probability model consistent with our correlated variables and dichotomous prediction setting. Moreover, we use a linear ML model (i.e., Lasso regression), given its advantages in reducing ineffective predictors and transparency for ranking feature importance. Empirical results show that the proposed integration model has better prediction performance, and the obtained BN estimators and interactive features are the most important predictors. This study contributes to the booking cancellation literature by proposing an interpretable feature interaction and a prediction method integrating two types of effective models. The obtained accurate and interpretable cancellation prediction further contributes to offering practical implications to hoteliers in managerial decision-making.},

This study established an AIoT system specifically for asparagus growth and monitoring of pests and diseases, providing planting guidelines for farmers to grow asparagus and preventing outbreaks of pests and diseases. We have installed many IoT and AI sensors to track environmental changes and pest populations. In the summer, the fans are automatically turned on and off according to the temperature measured by the sensor. The cooling effect is observed on the temperature distribution interpolated with kriging. By correlation analysis, the relationship between environmental factors and asparagus yield and the relationship between environmental changes and pests were obtained, which can help to optimize the planting environment in terms of sunlight and temperature regulation, drip fertigation, irrigation, and pest control strategies. The deep learning model we developed can detect pests and count pest numbers with high accuracy. The model detection results show that with an IOU threshold of 0.5, precision, recall, mAP, and pest count accuracy reach 93.8%, 91.9%, 95.3%, and 95.8%, respectively.

Digitalized shopfloors can leverage an unprecedented availability of data for better and faster decision-making, resulting in enhanced operational performance. However, limited research has investigated the organizational and individual implications for those who run the manufacturing lines: production managers, supervisors, team leaders, and workers. By adopting a socio-technical framework, this study aims to disentangle the effects that digitalization has on shopfloors’ organizational structures, decision-making processes, and individual competencies, as well as the interdependencies among them. An exploratory approach was adopted, based on an empirical cross-country study involving 34 semi-structured interviews conducted in the Italian and Spanish automotive sectors. Analyzed through the lenses of information-processing, knowledge-based, and dynamic capability theories, our findings reveal through five propositions how digitalization induces a “polarization” of operational decision-making: shopfloors are run by knowledgeable data-empowered production managers and autonomous information-processing team leaders on the front line, with a reduced importance of supervisors. Upskilling needs appear for team leaders but not production workers, whose involvement, however, emerges as a key factor for a successful digitalization and overall performance in initial DT stages. This study contributes to literature on digitalization by exposing managerial tensions and dynamic capabilities, along with a deeper understanding of the micro-foundations of DT in terms of implications for shop-floor decision-makers. Managerial implications are directed at creating awareness about the centrality of production team leaders, and future research avenues are proposed.},

Despite its many advantages, including 24/7 access, high flexibility, rich content, and low cost, online learning suffers from high dropout rates that hamper pedagogical and economic goal outcomes. Enhanced student dropout prediction tools would help providers proactively detect students at risk of leaving and identify factors that they might address to help students continue their learning experience. Therefore, this study seeks to improve student dropout predictions, with three main contributions. First, it benchmarks a recently proposed logit leaf model (LLM) algorithm against eight other algorithms, using a real-life data set of 10,554 students of a global subscription-based online learning provider. The LLM outperforms all other methods in finding a balance between predictive performance and comprehensibility. Second, a new multilevel informative visualization of the LLM adds novel benefits, relative to a standard LLM visualization. Third, this research specifies the impacts of student demographics; classroom characteristics; and academic, cognitive, and behavioral engagement variables on student dropout. In reviewing LLM segments, these results show that different insights emerge for various student segments with different learning patterns. This notable result can be used to personalize student retention campaigns.},

Its unique on-demand features affect consumers' shopping behaviors. This study uses a difference-in-difference approach with propensity score matching and machine learning approaches to examine the impact of a new giant online-to-offline entrant on consumers' ordering and spending behavior. We find that overall, the new entrant has a negative impact on consumers' ordering and spending from the perspective of existing providers. This negative impact is amplified if the consumers are highly engaged on the platform. However, the new entrant effect is reduced if the providers use in-house rather than outsourced deliverymen or consumers have a relatively long distance from the new entrant. Furthermore, the new entrant effect is altered if the platform implements technological innovation. On a provider level, the new entrant has a direct negative impact on consumers' ordering and spending from homogenous providers; however, a positive spillover effect is observed in terms of increasing consumers' spending on heterogeneous providers. The direct effect occurs immediately, while the spillover effect appears in a time-lagged pattern. On a product level, we find that the new entrant negatively affects consumers' ordering and spending on substitute products also sold by the new entrant, but that their spending on non-substitute products is boosted. Our findings provide decision support for the new entrant and existing providers to expand the market to stimulate consumers' purchase from both, to enhance their financial performance.},

@article{DAVIS2024103896,
 abstract = {Organizational information security performance is increasingly dependent on employees’ security-related citizenship behaviors that stretch beyond the scope of formal organizational prescription and control. Unfortunately, cultivating enactment of these valued behaviors has proven challenging for many companies. The literature has recognized workplace relationships as important determinants of behavioral security outcomes and extra-role security behaviors (ERBs) in particular. Taken further, an employee's relationship with the immediate supervisor is recognized as one of the most influential relational factors shaping a variety of workplace behaviors, including those related to security. Consistent with these notions, scholars have called for making the employee-supervisor relationship a more central component of behavioral security research and practice. Currently however, beyond recognition of this relationship's importance, the knowledge base is unclear about how it shapes ERB enactment. Because employees view supervisors as both organizational agents and as individuals in their own rights, this relationship has the potential to drive productive or counterproductive security behaviors, depending on how aligned the supervisor's security values are with those of the organization. Yet, the security literature has given surprisingly little consideration to the notion that employees can differ in the extent to which they perceive supervisors as embodying organizational information security values. Responding to this gap, the current study examines how employee-supervisor relations and perceived security-related value alignment between supervisors and the broader organization shape employees’ commitment to organizational information security and ultimately, ERB enactment. Grounded in the social identity theory of leadership (SITL), a research model is developed that positions high-quality employee-supervisor exchange as a direct antecedent of affective commitment to organizational information security, which then serves as a central intrinsic motivational mechanism driving ERB enactment. Further, rooted in SITL's principles on leader prototypicality and supervisor organizational embodiment, employee-perceived value alignment between the immediate supervisor and the organization as a whole—referred to here as supervisor security embodiment (SSE)—is introduced as a critical boundary condition influencing the extent to which employee-supervisor relations drive commitment. Results from model testing empirically demonstrate the value of SSE in explicating how this important relationship shapes workplace ERB enactment, through its influence on affective commitment to organizational information security performance.},

 abstract = {Customer retention management relies on advanced analytics for decision making. Decision makers in this area require methods that are capable of accurately predicting which customers are likely to churn and that allow to discover drivers of customer churn. As a result, customer churn prediction models are frequently evaluated based on both their predictive performance and their capacity to extract meaningful insights from the models. In this paper, we extend hybrid segmented models for customer churn prediction by incorporating powerful models that can capture non-linearities. To ensure the interpretability of such segmented hybrid models, we introduce a novel model-agnostic approach that extends SHAP. We extensively benchmark the proposed methods on 14 customer churn datasets on their predictive performance. The interpretability aspect of the new model-agnostic approach for interpreting hybrid segmented models is illustrated using a case study. Our contributions to decision making literature are threefold. First, we introduce new hybrid segmented models as powerful tools for decision makers to boost predictive performance. Second, we provide insights in the relative predictive performance by an extensive benchmarking study that compares the new hybrid segmented methods with their base models and existing hybrid models. Third, we propose a model-agnostic tool for segmented hybrid models that provide decision makers with a tool to gain insights for any hybrid segmented model and illustrate it on a case study. Although we focus on customer retention management in this study, this paper is also relevant for decision makers that rely on predictive modeling for other tasks.},

 abstract = {Process analytics is a collection of data-driven techniques for, among others, making predictions for individual process instances or overall process models. At the instance level, various novel techniques have been recently devised, tackling analytical tasks such as next activity, remaining time, or outcome prediction. However, there is a notable void regarding predictions at the process model level. It is the ambition of this article to fill this gap. More specifically, we develop a technique to forecast the entire process model from historical event data. A forecasted model is a will-be process model representing a probable description of the overall process for a given period in the future. Such a forecast helps, for instance, to anticipate and prepare for the consequences of upcoming process drifts and emerging bottlenecks. Our technique builds on a representation of event data as multiple time series, each capturing the evolution of a behavioural aspect of the process model, such that corresponding time series forecasting techniques can be applied. Our implementation demonstrates the feasibility of process model forecasting using real-world event data. A user study using our Process Change Exploration tool confirms the usefulness and ease of use of the produced process model forecasts.},

 abstract = {Online customer reviews (OCR) are an established source of competitive intelligence. Since OCR reflect perceptions of past users about product features and performance, prospective customers of mobile apps often resort to OCR before they decide to download an app. In addition to the textual content of the OCR, potential users of the app often consult the star ratings provided by the reviewers. In this paper, we determine if the star rating of mobile payment apps suitably captures the appropriate customer perception reflected in the textual content of the OCR for the payment apps. We conduct a three-dimensional analysis of 146,914 reviews from two popular mobile payment apps and uncover the sentiment and emotions captured in the review text, and the reactions in the emojis. Our analysis shows that the consolidated sentiment and the happiness emotion obtained from the OCR of mobile payment apps impacts the star ratings more strongly, than other emotions embedded in the text, and reactions in the emojis. The findings also hold good during the Covid-19 pandemic. We propose a novel perception score that captures the nuances in the OCR more effectively and suggest how mobile app providers can use it to arrange the OCR for better compatibility with content. The results of this research will be useful for mobile app providers that depend on OCR for popularizing their apps and will provide them a novel metric based on content, that can leverage OCR better to influence future downloads.},

 abstract = {Organizations across the globe are devising novel approaches to strive for carbon neutrality. Global institutions have manifested the critical need to develop reasonable strategies in every sector to mitigate the impending issues of excessive anthropogenic carbon emission and, in consequence, climate change. World‑leading economies have initiated significant steps by developing zero‑carbon emission policies to monitor the escalating carbon emissions to curb global warming. The clothing industry has a substantial carbon footprint while causing environmental pollution. Based on transition management theory, this study aims to explore and evaluate the critical determinants that can assist in pursuing carbon neutrality in the clothing industry. A decision support system comprising an integrated voting analytical hierarchy process (VAHP) and Bayesian network (BN) method fulfills our purpose. Pertinent literature is reviewed to determine the critical determinants for carbon neutrality (CDs-CN). After that, the VAHP method is employed to prioritize the CDs-CN. Further, the influence of CDs-CN on achieving carbon neutrality is modeled using a BN, predicting the carbon neutrality index (CNI) for the clothing industry. The findings reveal that professional expertise, laws and certifications, technological acceptance, availability of decarbonizing methods, and adequate carbon offsetting are the essential CDs-CN. This research extends the existing knowledge on integrating MCDM-ML techniques to address predictive modelling-based problems involving complex structures. Simultaneously, the present study helps practitioners and policymakers understand the key CDs-CN to successfully build and manage a carbon-neutral clothing industry by adopting the suggested strategies. Finally, recommendations concerning sustainable development goals (SDGs) are provided to achieve carbon-neutral manufacturing supply chains.},

It aims to co-evolve cutting-edge models of educational delivery. This research cluster has emerged from the work of the INSYTE Centre located in the INSYTE-Cooley Research Lab (ICRL) in the Digitization Hub of the Luke Wadding Library at SETU, Waterford. Educational techniques have evolved over the past decades and these advances have not necessarily filtered down to various disciplines, e.g. engineering. The focus of this research cluster is to have the ‘Learner’ at the center of the ‘Learning Experience’ and to wrap the technology around them. This in turn, will increase the adoption and usage of such technologies. It will do this by cross-fertilization of knowledge over diverse domains to produce customised human-centred solutions for communities. Equality, diversity and inclusion are critical strands in this research. This paper shows that the European Union (EU) is supportive of changes in education required to close the skills gap in engineering and to enable reskilling to support Industry 5.0. In addition to the creation of cutting-edge models of educational delivery the vision of this multidisciplinary human centered research cluster is the establishment of a state-of-the-art pilot factory as an Irish national initiative in SETU, Waterford.},

The paper adopts a deep neural network-based prediction model for conducting sentiment analysis on heterogeneous datasets. We construct a sentiment simulation model of voluntary disclosures to know whether the managers can use the market sentiment as a strategic input to boost market performance by suitably drafting the tone and content of disclosures without compromising their quality and veracity. The Deep Neural Networks with LSTM algorithm is found to outperform the Deep Neural Networks with RNN and other baseline machine learning classifiers in terms of predictive accuracy of the NSE NIFTY50.

The present evaluation is based on the data of students from three different study programs. One result is that the recommendations do lower the dropout risk. We also discovered that while the recommended courses differed from those taken by students who dropped out, they matched quite well with courses taken by students who completed the degree program. Although the course recommender system targets primarily students at risk, students doing well could use it. Furthermore, we found that the number of recommended courses for struggling students is less than the number of courses they actually enrolled in.

 abstract = {Rising market demands, economic pressures, and technological advancements have spurred researchers to seek ways to enhance business environments and scientific productivity. Predictive science, crucial in this context, has gained prominence due to the rapid progress in information technology and forecasting algorithms. Time series forecasting, widely used in fields like engineering, economics, tourism, and energy, has inherent limitations with classical statistical methods, leading researchers to explore artificial intelligence and fuzzy logic for more accurate predictions. However, despite extensive efforts to improve accuracy, challenges persist. The research introduces a model aimed at surpassing existing methods in time series forecasting accuracy. This approach combines meta-heuristic optimization algorithms and neutrosophic logic to enhance precision in uncertain and complex environments, promising improved forecasting outcomes. The study shows that the performance of the neutrosophic time series modeling approach is highly dependent on the optimal selection of the universe of discourse and its corresponding intervals. This study selects the quantum optimization algorithm (QOA), genetic algorithm (GA), and particle swarm optimization (PSO) to address this weakness. These optimization algorithms improve the performance of the NTS modeling approach by selecting the global universe of discourse and corresponding intervals from the list of locally optimal solutions. The proposed hybrid model (i.e., NTS-QOA model) is verified and validated with datasets of university enrollment of Alabama (USA), Taiwan futures exchange (TAIFEX) index, and Taiwan Stock Exchange Corporation (TSEC) weighted index. Various experimental results signified the efficiency of the proposed model over existing benchmark models in terms of average forecasting error rate (AFER). This value using the proposed NTS QOA, NTS GA, and NTS PSO method on the university dataset is 0.166, 0.167, 0.164, on the TAIFEX dataset, is 0.081, 0.081, and 0.081, and on the TSEC dataset is 0.09, 0.09, and 0.09, respectively.},

 abstract = {This paper developed optimal maintenance policies for industrial machines to ensure uninterrupted production. Analytical and intelligent replacement models were constructed using real-time data from a commercial photocopier operator’s expenditure logbook between 2012 and 2023. A goodness-of-fit test affirmed a log-logistic failure distribution with shape and scale parameters of 1.7233 and 763.9220, respectively. Probability functions from this distribution established replacement models, determining optimal preventive maintenance conditions. Through feature engineering additional features crucial for operational and cost optimization were abstracted, with 4,881 unique data points simulated from boundary conditions defined by the original or raw data. Analytical results showed that the failure distribution-based replacement model outperformed the hazard function-based model in minimum replacement time and unit maintenance cost over time, while key parameters such as availability, reliability, and failure occurrence probability remained constant at 96 %, 94 %, and 0.07 %, respectively. Machine learning models (Extreme Gradient Boosting: XGBoost, Support Vector Machine: SVM, and Multilayer Perceptron: MLP) demonstrated very high accuracy in availability (XGBoost = 99.49 %, SVM = 99.18 %, RF = 100 %, MLP = 99.80 %), reliability (XGBoost = 99.49 %, SVM = 99.18 %, RF = 100 %, MLP = 99.80 %), and maintenance cost (XGBoost = 100 %, SVM = 100 %, RF = 100 %, MLP = 100 %), exceeding results of the analytical models.},

 abstract = {Recommender systems play an important role in identifying and filtering relevant products based on the behaviors of users. Nevertheless, recommender systems suffer from the ‘cold-start’ problem, which occurs when no prior information about a new session or a user is available. Many approaches to solving the cold-start problem have been presented in the literature. However, there is still room for improving the performance of recommender systems in the cold-start stage. In this article, we present a novel method to alleviate the cold-start problem in session-based recommender systems. The purpose of this work is to develop a session similarity-based cold-start session alleviation approach for recommendation systems. The developed method uses previous sessions’ contextual and temporal features to find sessions similar to the newly started one. Our results on three different datasets show that, based on the provided Mean Average Precision and Normalised Discounted Cumulative Gain scores, the Session Similarity-based Framework consistently outperforms baseline models in terms of recommendation relevance and ranking quality across three used datasets. Our approach can be used to address the challenges associated with cold start sessions where no previously interacted items are present.},

 abstract = {This study aims to identify recurring Digital Transformation (DT) archetypes within firms and explore the capabilities and values associated with each archetype. Underpinned by the Resource-Based View (RBV) and Socio-Technical Systems (STS) theory, the study provides a framework explicating the enabling factors, their characteristics, interdependencies, operational capabilities, and resultant value creation within the context of digitalizing firm operations. Employing a deductive-inductive approach, an exhaustive literature review combined with an in-depth, multiple case study analysis of sixteen firms provides rich insights into the digital transformation journey. Findings reveal technology, data, human capital, processes, and organization structure as key enablers alongside their critical, complementary roles for transformation. Cross-case analysis identified instances of the DT framework, uncovering three archetypes: process efficiency, responsiveness, and strategic agility. Each archetype exhibits distinct socio-technical enabler configurations and improvements to business processes, resulting in unique operational capabilities and value generation. This research provides actionable guidance for managers in leveraging socio-technical enablers to achieve successful digital transformation. It underscores the need for tailored strategies, recognizing that a one-size-fits-all approach is inadequate. Managers must strategically select desired values and develop the necessary socio-technical system components, processes, and operational capabilities to attain them.

 abstract = {This paper describes an artificial intelligence (AI) based failure management approach across the value chain for the commercial vehicle industry by integrating and utilizing lifecycle data for product and production optimization. The amount of available data throughout a product lifecycle has increased significantly in previous years, primarily driven by the development and deployment of cyber-physical systems. While data from a single entity in the value chain already enables failure management-related analysis and services, including AI-based methods such as predictive maintenance, there remains a lack of systematic approaches to utilize data across the entire value chain. This paper proposes an AI-based failure management approach, which relies on integrating a variety of diverse data sources along the value chain. At first, three so-called application areas were defined: process and product optimization, availability optimization, and performance optimization. Consequently, practice-relevant use cases are identified for each area, for which it is shown how failures in the value chain can be proactively eliminated with the support of AI. Methods for predictive analytics are adapted for cross-value chain failure management to derive correlations between different stages of the production process and product usage. Based on these results and human expert knowledge, proactive measures are recommended by a decision support system (DSS) to resolve failures before arising. The commercial vehicle industry serves as an overarching validation case study for the practice-relevant verification of the targeted applications. The paper gives an outlook on the envisaged research work for the realization of holistic failure management.},

Using real-world call center data from a large insurance company, we train an ensemble model with these emotion dynamics features to predict service quality. The model has higher prediction performance than the two benchmark approaches using quality-assurance evaluation and operational indices. Our method for emotion dynamics classification outperforms a host of state-of-the-art time series classification algorithms. We further apply explainable AI methods to identify the most important features of emotion dynamics and show how they are related to service quality. For example, the location where the last emotion episode appears in a service call has a U-shaped relationship to low quality. Finally, to demonstrate utility, we design an IT artifact to automatically measure service quality after service encounters in the call center and use the measure to predict a customer's referral intention.},

Moreover, this work evaluates the use of this tool to support decision-making of actual advisers in two different higher education institutions (University A, University B), compared with more traditional procedures and tools. Results indicate that LADA enables expert advisers to evaluate significantly more scenarios (Median = 2), especially for high advising difficulty cases with students that failed many courses (MedianA=3,MedianB=2.5), in a not-significantly different amount of time. For inexperienced advisers, LADA is perceived as a valuable tool for more accurate and efficient decision-making, as they were able to make informed decisions in a similar amount of time compared to the experts.

To address these challenges in leveraging multi-source information for credit scoring, we propose a decentralized multi-party method based on logistic regression. Specifically, we formulate a logistic regression model using the vertical federated learning paradigm. To preserve data privacy during multi-party collaborative model training, we use additively homomorphic encryption based on the second-order Taylor series expansion of the loss function and its gradient. To address information redundancy and to improve the performance of the credit scoring model, we use the proposed HE-DPGD algorithm to estimate the distributed coefficients in a privacy-preserving setting. Empirical evaluation shows that the proposed method can leverage information from multiple parties securely and effectively.},

 abstract = {This study builds on the existing poverty literature and leverages data from disparate sources including both big data sources such as satellite images and traditional data sources such as the federal, state, and local agencies to develop a context-specific poverty prediction model using design science. We examine whether and to what extent infrastructure development as measured from the satellite images as well as spatial spillovers helps predict the poverty rate of a given census tract. We also develop and implement a Vector Autoregression (VAR) based ensemble model that combines predictions from daytime and nighttime imaging with adjacent tracts' poverty rates and other economic and demographic factors identified in prior literature. Our results show that daytime imaging and spatial network features have significant predictive value and that a combination of these features gives the best predictive power. In addition, we find that the skewness of poverty rates among adjacent census tracts, not the average, is a significant predictor showing the importance of distribution of poverty around a region. Our work has major implications for researchers using deep learning and network analysis for policy development and decision making.},

Despite the abundance of literature on retail technology management, empirical evidence on the effectiveness of a customer analytics capability in promoting sustainable market performance within retail business operations remains scarce. This study presents a model of a sustained customer analytics capability in the context of competitive, data-rich retail business processes, drawing on grounded market orientation capability theory. The study employs a taxonomy of explanation and prediction from an epistemological perspective, employing predominantly positivist methods, where data analysis validates the conceptual customer analytics capability and its sustained critical outcomes. In addition, the study discusses the significant contributions of its findings regarding the acceleration of retail business operational performance in a big data environment and also provides future research directions to resolve any limitations of the current study.},

 abstract = {Current research recommends security education, training, and awareness (SETA) programs as an effective way to counter internal security threats and promote employees’ security behaviors. Contrary to the dominant approach, which views SETA as a simple, single construct, we argue that the attributes of SETA are the key determinants of the programs’ impact on individuals. More specifically, we bridge this gap by using event system theory (EST) to conceptualize SETA programs as “organization events” and empirically test the role of SETA attributes in affecting employees’ intentions to comply with security policy (i.e., in-role behavioral intentions) and extra-role behavioral intentions. The results of this research advance the understanding of SETA attributes and their impacts on employees’ compliance intentions and extra-role behavioral intentions from the EST perspective. The results suggest that the novelty of SETA event is more effective in fueling extra-role behavioral intention than compliance intention. The results also suggest that criticality exerts a similar positive influence on both compliance and extra-role behavioral intention, while the disruption of SETA event has a significant negative effect on these two intentions. Further, there is evidence that the negative relationship between SETA event disruption and two security behavioral intentions is stronger when the SETA event is dispersed throughout a wide range of organizational hierarchy levels. The expected research and practical implications are also discussed in the paper.},

This article studies a data-driven analytical approach that exploits the rich data accumulated in organizations in the digital era to design teams, including prescribing team composition and formation decisions. We propose to evaluate a team regarding its performance and temporal stability, referred to as sustainable effectiveness (SE). Our approach estimates the team's performance and stability using machine learning models. It then optimizes an integrated objective of the team's performance and stability through mixed-integer programming models formulated according to predictive models. Consequently, this approach mines meaningful team compositions from historical data and guides strategic team formation accordingly. We conduct empirical studies using authentic data from our partner company in the real estate brokerage industry. The findings reveal that teams that adhere to our model's recommendations achieve an average percentage improvement of 153.1% to 156.5% higher than the benchmark teams, particularly when recruiting one or two members in their actual SE during the post-formation period. We further disclose the mechanism underlying this improvement from the perspective of changes in team compositions.

However, when various data views, e.g., report texts, forum posts, and legal judgments, are jointly utilized, modeling challenges, such as heterogeneities in distribution and completeness among data views, may be inevitably raised. To this end, we propose a variational deep financial distress prediction method (VDFDP). The proposed method consists of three modules: a view-specific encoder module to learn a latent representation for each view, a view fusion module to learn a joint representation by transferring knowledge from all views considering different degrees of completeness, and a financial distress decoder module to map joint representation to financial distress status. Empirical evaluation using Chinese listed company data shows that VDFDP significantly outperformed all benchmarked financial distress prediction methods. It can more effectively leverage incomplete multi-view data and more accurately predict financial distress. Our study also provides valuable insights and practical implications for stakeholders, such as investors and companies themselves, to effectively identify risk signals and make risk management decisions.},

 abstract = {Digitization era is altering several industries which include the way in which the data is analyzed and it is inferred that about 2.7 Zettabytes of data exist in the digital world today. By 2020 the data generated per second for every human being will approximate amount to 1.7 megabytes and the volume of data would double every 2 years thus reach the 40 ZB point by 2020. Interactive Data Corporation (IDC) estimated that by the end of year 2020, the e-commerce transactions B2B and B2C will hit 450 billion per day on the internet. The advent of Big and real time Data has triggered disruptive changes in many fields and the exploding volume of different sources of data like heterogeneous data, data integration, spatio-temporal correlation of data, batch analytics and real-time analytics, data sharing, semantic interoperability requires the development of a scalable platform that can fuse multiple data layers to handles the data intelligently. In Big Data approaches, the challenge is not anymore to collect the data, but to draw valuable conclusions by properly analyzing them. The growth in Unstructured Data generated by business is irrefutable and they are under more pressure to preserve it for longer periods of time. To be clear, exploiting the collected data has been always considered by practitioners and researchers, but the huge velocity, heterogeneity and enormity of massive stream of real-time data shove the limits of the current storage, management and processing capabilities. Admittedly, the traditional method of Extract, Transform and Load (ETL) are challenged and cannot be applied on the emerging opportunistically and crowed sensed data streams. Some of these data streams are structured in a way that serve only one predefined purpose and cannot be directly used for other means. Yet, there are emerging unstructured data such as context-based data from the internet and social media as well as credit card transactions that is not clear if they can be used to better understand the mobility patterns. The analytical company Gartner states that by 2020 there will be over 26 billion interconnected devices. It is obvious, that they will produce massive amounts of meaningful data. Those data can be used for many applications such as real-time industrial equipment monitoring, traffic planning, automated maintenance, etc. Therefore, it is essential to develop modern system abstractions that allow us to resourcefully process huge and new data streams. This enormous amount of data urges the growth of integrated and insightful big and real-time data analytics Platforms. The upcoming contemporary technology like digital twin, integrates historical data from past machine usage to the current data. It uses sensors to collect the real-time data, working status and other operational data attached to the physical model. These components send the relevant data via a cloud-based system to the other side of the bridge with the help of data analytics platform which produces the required insights. The big and real-time data analytics Platforms assist to perform useful operations on data analytics as a complete package. For this purpose, data analytics platform are used to acquire constructive insight from the huge volume of data. Data analytics platform is an ecosystem of technologies and services that can help the businesses in increasing revenues, enhance operational efficiency, stabilize marketing campaigns and customer service efforts, respond more quickly to emerging market trends and gain a competitive edge over rivals. The data analytics platform finds the pattern and relationships in data by applying statistical techniques and communicates the results generated by analytical models to executives and end users to make decisions with the help of data visualization tools that display data on a single screen and can be updated in real time as new information becomes available. Big data and real-time data analytics platform supports the full spectrum of data types, protocols and integration to speed up and simplify the data wrangling process. The big data and real time platform provides accurate data, increase efficiency in the workspace, gives answers to complex questions along with security and hence it plays the key role in business analytics.},

Leveraging metaverse technologies—such as virtual reality and augmented reality—for project visualization, collaborative design, and training simulations—in the building industry is attracting increasing attention. Notwithstanding its possible advantages, there is a clear knowledge vacuum on the obstacles preventing the general acceptance of metaverse technology in building. The study intends to close this gap by means of a literature review and analysis of the identified barriers using the fuzzy-DEMATEL technique, therefore separating the causal links among them. There were 26 obstacles found in the literature review and expert comments, arranged technically, organizationally, environmentally, socially, and economically. The most important obstacles shown by results are Security Concerns, Resistance to Change, Lack of Expertise, Siloed Departments, and Training and Education Needs. The results of this research provide building companies and legislators with important new perspectives and direction in developing plans to remove obstacles and encourage the use of metaverse technology. Moreover, the findings of the study provide a road map for industry players in tackling the important issue of restricted data capacities, thereby enabling a better and more successful integration of metaverse technology into building methods.},

 abstract = {Academic institutions operate in an extremely demanding and competitive environment. Some difficulties confronting most schools are delivering high-quality education to the students, developing systems for evaluating student performance, analyzing performance, and recognizing the future demands of their learners. Also, due to the paradigm shift due to the computerization of school data management, educational stakeholders, including the machine learning (ML) community, have taken an interest in analyzing performance traits using academic and non-academic factors. This systematic literature review identifies various machine learning methods based on 84 selected publications. It shows how researchers have been able to pattern-map student characteristics and their influence on school performance. An attempt is made to answer how the overall study coverage of student characteristics and the ML methods are employed to predict students’ performance. An analysis of the 84 papers highlights that, student characteristics predominantly influencing performance are academic and demographic attributes. The study further shows that classification and decision trees are the most widely used methods and algorithms. The review also reveals population and practical knowledge gaps due to a lack of research on basic academic performance and prescription of intervention plans for averting poor performance through mapping these influential characteristics to student accomplishment. To bridge these perceived gaps, the scope of the population sample needs a benchmarked dataset and embedding the appropriate intervention outlines that will map the learner’s performance early in their school life.},

 abstract = {Automatic clustering is a challenging problem, especially when the decision-maker has little or no information about the nature of the dataset and the criteria of interest. There is a lack of generalizability in the current validity indexes (VI) for automatic clustering algorithms, as each considers a limited number of objectives and mostly ignores the other aspects of clustering validation. The proposed framework benefits from collaboration among selected evolutionary algorithms. A mixed-integer non-linear programming model is developed, and a framework is proposed for a six-step decision support system to solve it. The decision-maker (DM) selects the quantitative (primary) VIs and the evolutionary algorithms. Given DM's knowledge on the dataset and VIs, DM can incorporate qualitative (secondary) VIs. DM determines the quality threshold for each VI and runs the evolutionary algorithms separately. The DSS then saves the best obtained value of VIs in order to prepare the input necessary to construct the aggregated function. Based on the selected primary VIs, a new normalized aggregated function is developed and solved repeatedly using the randomly selected or predefined weights of importance. Eventually, DM employs a proper DEA model to define the final clustering output among all possible solutions. Given multiple efficient solutions, the best-worst method and a multi-criteria decision-making approach are applied to find the final output. The applicability of the proposed approach is illustrated on a synthetic and two secondary datasets, and the result at each step is discussed in detail.},

The fourth industrial revolution, known as Industry 4.0, also promises increasing automation and real-time oriented control systems in smart factories by integrating cutting-edge technologies, such as cyber-physical systems, Internet of Things, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence. In the context of Industry 4.0, manufacturing resources are autonomous and automated to control themselves in response to different situations by self-awareness, self-optimization, and self-configuration through vertical and horizontal integration. Therefore industrial automation requires the ability of data exchange, data processing, data analytics, and decision-making. Cloud, fog, and edge computing, and 5G technologies provide high-performance computing power and wireless communication systems to achieve this goal. This chapter is devoted to investigating cloud, fog and edge computing, and 5G technologies for industrial automation in the era of Industry 4.0. Definitions of key terms and concepts underpinning these technologies are presented and followed by a taxonomy of their applications in various aspects after Industry 4.0 was first coined. Discussions and the future outlook regarding these technologies are shown to point out their importance, challenges, and opportunities for realization of industrial automation. Finally, future development and roadmap toward Industry 5.0 are designed to present future research directions, such as human centricity, sustainability, and resilience.},

 abstract = {The ability to move production between different geographical locations has recently become more important, due to the increasing need for sustainability and faster response times, complying with local regulations, and dealing with brittle international supply chains. To this end, the movable factory concept has been put forward, which is defined as mobile production units that can be installed near the customer’s location. Unfortunately, industrial paradigms such as Industry 4.0 make little if any notice of movable factories but instead focus on the digitalization of their fixed counterparts. In the form of a systematic literature review, this paper breaks down the concept of the movable factory, relates it to the state-of-the-art, and summarizes its main use cases, requirements, research gaps, and opportunities. The review covers over 100 relevant articles published in the past two decades. Compared to existing surveys, we have not only focused on the motivations for movable factories, but also identified research gaps and discuss the impact of modern technologies such as Internet-of-Things, digital twins, and modeling and simulation in fulfilling these gaps.

 abstract = {As a critical consideration in investment decisions, stock liquidity has significance for all stakeholders in the market. It also has implications for the stock market’s growth. Liquidity enables investors and issuers to meet their requirements regarding investment, financing or hedging, reducing investment costs and the cost of capital. The aim of this paper is to develop the machine learning models for liquidity prediction. The subject of research is the Vietnamese stock market, focusing on the recent years - from 2011 to 2019. Vietnamese stock market differs from developed markets and emerging markets. It is characterized by a limited number of transactions, which are also relatively small. The Multilayer Perceptron, Long-Short Term Memory and Linear Regression models have been developed. On the basis of the experimental results, it can be concluded that the LSTM model allows for prediction characterized by lowest value of MSE. The results of research can be used for developing the methods for decision support on stock markets.},

 abstract = {Product-based companies worldwide attempt to integrate services into their offerings, embarking on “servitization” as a key strategy. These days, the acceleration of technological innovation (i.e., Industry 4.0) has triggered an emerging IT-driven business paradigm called digital servitization or smart product-service system (PSS) that embeds Industry 4.0 technologies. As a result of these developments, related literature has expanded across different disciplines in recent years. However, understanding and describing literature is not easy considering its volume and variety. Establishing common ground for central concepts is essential for science. Thus, to clarify important topics and research issues on servitization and PSSs in Industry 4.0, we carry out a comprehensive literature review by performing text mining of 419 journal articles. A machine learning approach is applied to learn and identify the specific topics, and the suggested key references are manually reviewed to develop a state-of-the-art overview. A total of 10 key research topics are identified, and the enabler–engineering–goal framework is developed. This study contributes to clarifying a systematized view of dispersed studies of servitization and PSSs in Industry 4.0 across multiple disciplines and encourages further academic discussions and industrial transformation.},

Prior studies categorised digital transformation into three distinct phases of digitisation, digitalisation, and digital transformation. They mainly focus on the operational or functional levels, however, this study considers digital transformation at the strategic level. Previous studies confirmed that using new emerging AI-based technologies will enable organisations to use digital transformation to achieve higher efficiency. A novel methodological AI-based approach for policymaking was constructed into three phases through the lens of organisational learning theory. The proposed framework was validated using a case study in the transportation industry of a small municipality. In the selected case study, a confirmatory model was developed and tested utilising the Structural Equation Modelling with data collected from a survey of 494 local stakeholders. Artificial Neural Network was utilised to predict and then to identify the most appropriate policy according to cost, feasibility, and impact criteria amongst six policies extracted from the literature. The results from this research confirm that utilisation of the AI-based strategic decision-making through the proposed generative AI platform at strategic level outperforms human decision-making in terms of applicability, efficiency, and accuracy.},

 abstract = {Cloud computing has many benefits for businesses because of its distinctive qualities, including scalability, flexibility, on-demand service, and security. A good task scheduler is required to increase the efficiency of a cloud system, which performs numerous jobs simultaneously. On-demand access to resources that have been virtualized is made available as a service without the need for further waiting. For task scheduling issues based on a makespan limitation, energy consumption is decreased, significantly reducing energy cost. Additionally, the complexity of scheduling issues has increased primarily due to the application's lack of a makespan constraint. Unfortunately, reducing the energy cloud services use presents special research issues and difficulties. More precisely, because of the diversity of servers found in cloud centers, it is challenging to choose the best servers for cloud-based decision support systems to reduce energy usage. The presented approach is innovative and could be applied for complex applications while maintaining an average energy consumption for the running resources, which is a big challenge. The current process finds an optimized energy minimization in the cloud with a combination of Virtual Machine consolidation. The outputs were considered in terms of Energy, Virtual Machine Migration, Performance Degradation, Aggregated Ideal Time Factor, and Aggregated Overload Time Fraction. The obtained results in terms of the existing state of art approaches are far better than the competing approaches.},

Despite the undeniable importance of this topic, the primary research on the impact of IoT technology is inconsistent and scattered. The present study aims to review state-of-art literature on the application of IoT technology in the warehousing and logistics field and suggests a path for the future research through an in-depth analysis of studies done in this area. Sixty-four research articles were carefully selected after a thorough search of the Scopus and EBSCO databases, covering the period from January 2011 to 07th December 2021, to examine the applications of the IoT in the warehousing and logistics business. These articles were thoroughly reviewed and classified in terms of year-wise distribution, major publication outlets, types of study, and highly cited papers to understand the evolution and ongoing trends in this field. The findings reveal that majority of the studies on IoT in the warehousing and logistics domain have been conducted in developed countries. While logistics has been widely investigated, studies on the warehousing domain are limited. Also, there is an under-presentation of various theories in IoT research. The study highlights various gaps by synthesising existing literature and provides a fertile ground for conducting future research in this domain. Supply chain practitioners and researchers will find this review timely and valuable, which offers several valuable implications for them.},

 abstract = {Sustainable manufacturing aims to deal with the challenges such as climate change, biodiversity loss and resource scarcity by minimising the environmental impacts due to product, processes, and systems through optimal use of energy and resources. Life cycle assessment (LCA) has become an important tool to identify, evaluate and assess the environmental impact of a product, process, or system, along with all the stages of the life cycle of a product. However, several drawbacks such as complexity, uncertainty and impreciseness are also associated with this methodology. Therefore, live LCA as a plausible solution, is gaining popularity with the advancements in Industry 4.o tools and techniques, enhancing ability to collect and analyse live data from various processes, interpret results, identify hotspots, trade-offs, and present better ideas about the environmental impacts in-line with the process. This paper proposes a cyber-physical production system framework for live LCA to estimate the environmental impact of 3D printed products with different combinations of design and process parameters. Also, optimum settings of these parameters are determined, and validated to minimize the environmental impacts. This enables real-time monitoring of the environmental impacts, driving prompt decision support for useful insights to the operator, project manager, business manager, or customer thereby improving the visibility and transparency.},

 abstract = {For any organization, personnel selection is regarded as one of the most critical and complex issues in human resource management. Due to the fuzziness and ambiguity in personnel selection, it was usually tackled by utilizing multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methods. Previously developed MCDM methods for personnel selection have principally depended on experts’ preferences, which may lead to the bias and deviation caused by human cognitive limitations. With the development of information technology, many human resource (HR) data have accumulated within some organizations, making it possible to discover meaningful patterns in HR data based on data analytics algorithms (DAAs). These patterns do not depend on experts’ judgement and can objectively reflect the performance of personnel in several aspects. Thus, it is promising that integrating objective patterns obtained from HR data and experts’ judgement can make personnel selection more systematic and scientific. To tackle this complex scenario, we propose a data-driven decision-making framework that combines DAAs and MCDM method. The proposed framework can explore the underlying patterns in HR data and also consider experts’ judgement during the selection process. In this framework, a data-driven competency-based method is designed to mine out valuable information in HR data. In addition, for assisting multiple experts, a linear group best–worst​ method (LGBWM) is proposed to calculate the weights of criteria, and intuitionistic fuzzy numbers (IFNs) are used to help experts express their preferences. A personnel evaluation and selection (PLEAS) decision support system is also designed and developed to implement the framework better. In order to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, a real-world case is conducted in a Chinese state-owned company, and the results demonstrate that our proposed framework is valid for solving data-driven personnel selection problems.},

 abstract = {Increasingly, researchers have come to acknowledge that consumption activities entail both utilitarian and hedonic components. Whereas utilitarian consumption accentuates the achievement of predetermined outcomes typical of cognitive consumer behavior, its hedonic counterpart relates to affective consumer behavior in dealing with the emotive and multisensory aspects of the shopping experience. Consequently, while utilitarian consumption activities appeal to the rationality of customers in inducing their intellectual buy-in of the shopping experience, customers’ corresponding emotional buy-in can only be attained through the presence of hedonic consumption activities. The same can be said for online shopping. Because the online shopping environment is characterized by the existence of an IT-enabled web interface that acts as the focal point of contact between customers and vendors, its design should embed utilitarian and hedonic elements to create a holistic shopping experience. Building on Expectation Disconfirmation Theory (EDT), this study advances a research model that not only delineates between customers’ utilitarian and hedonic expectations for online shopping but also highlights how these expectations can be best served through functional and esthetic performance, respectively. Furthermore, we introduce online shopping experience (i.e., transactional frequency) as a moderator affecting not only how customers form utilitarian and hedonic expectations but also how they evaluate the functional and esthetic performances of e-commerce sites. The model is then empirically validated via an online survey questionnaire administered on a sample of 303 respondents. Theoretical contributions and pragmatic implications to be gleaned from our research model and its subsequent empirical validation are discussed.},

 abstract = {In the current stage, software defect prediction is suffering the imbalanced data problem. Traditional methods are insensitive to defect-prone modules and tend to predict defect-prone modules as defect-free modules. To deal with this problem, sampling techniques are adopted to rebalance the defect-prone and defect-free data to train the predictive model in order to improve the performance. However, it is not clear on the combined effect of the sampling techniques and the machine learning classifiers on the performance of software defect prediction. The intent of the paper is to study the performance impact on defect prediction incurred by different combinations of sampling techniques and machine learning classifiers. Specifically, we investigate three types of sampling techniques as resampling, spread subsampling and SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique), and five types of machine learning classifiers as C4.5, naive Bayes, logistic regression, support vector machine and deep learning to study their combined effect on defect prediction. By using the Friedman test and Nemenyi test, we find that there isn't an optimal method among all the 12 combinations in defect prediction. However, support vector machine and deep learning have produced the best performance stably among all the investigated projects. With ANOVA analysis, we find that the sampling techniques have great impact on the outcomes of defect prediction because they produce different data distributions for model training. Nevertheless, the sampling proportion has significant impacts on TPR (True Positive Ratio) and FPR (False Positive Ratio) while it can merely influence the AUC (Area under Curve) and Balance of logistic regression. We explain the experimental results in the paper.},

 abstract = {Data integration plays a crucial role in business intelligence, aiding decision-makers by consolidating data from heterogeneous sources to provide deep insights into business operations and performance. In the big data era, automated data integration solutions need to process high volumes of disparate data robustly and seamlessly for various analytical needs or operational actions. Existing data integration solutions exhibit limited capabilities for capturing and modeling users' needs to execute on-demand data integration. This study, underpinned by affordance theory and the goal definition principles from the Goal-Question-Metric approach, designs and instantiates a goal-driven data integration framework for data analytics. The proposed innovative design automates data integration for non-technical data users. Specifically, it demonstrates how to elicit and ontologize users' data-analytic goals and addresses semantic heterogeneity, thereby recognizing goal-relevant datasets. In a structured evaluation using the context of counter-terrorism analytics, our design artifact shows promising performance in capturing diverse and dynamic user goals for data analytics and in generating integrated data tailored to these goals. Our research establishes a theoretical framework to guide future scholars and practitioners in building smart, goal-driven data integration.},

 abstract = {With the rapid development of e-commerce platforms, how to better identify and filter fake reviews has become an urgent issue for the healthy development of the e-commerce industry. However, traditional fake review identification methods cannot effectively solve this problem. They are easily affected by text changes, language differences, and context, and fake reviewers may take measures to blur their behavioral characteristics, making them difficult to detect by behavior-based algorithms. Large language models can capture the contextual relationships of the entire text through self-attention mechanisms, thereby understanding the overall meaning and emotional tendency of the review, which enables them to more effectively judge the authenticity of the review. In addition, large models have strong generalization ability and a certain degree of interpretability, which also makes them suitable for research on fake review text identification. Since fake reviews have an asymmetric distribution feature, this paper uses the RoBERTa model to extract information and combine it with the behavioral features in traditional research for model training. Compared with traditional methods, the accuracy rate is improved by nearly 3%.},

 abstract = {Faced with the rapid increase in smart Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices and the high demand for new business-oriented services in the fifth-generation (5G) and beyond network, the management of mobile networks is getting complex. Thus, traditional Network Management and Orchestration (MANO) approaches cannot keep up with rapidly evolving application requirements. This challenge has motivated the adoption of the Zero-touch network and Service Management (ZSM) concept to adapt the automation into network services management. By automating network and service management, ZSM offers efficiency to control network resources and enhance network performance visibility. The ultimate target of the ZSM concept is to enable an autonomous network system capable of self-configuration, self-monitoring, self-healing, and self-optimization based on service-level policies and rules without human intervention. Thus, the paper focuses on conducting a comprehensive survey of E2E ZSM architecture and solutions for 5G and beyond networks. The article begins by presenting the fundamental ZSM architecture and its essential components and interfaces. Then, a comprehensive review of the state-of-the-art for key technical areas, i.e., ZSM automation, cross-domain E2E service lifecycle management, and security aspects, are presented. Furthermore, the paper contains a summary of recent standardization efforts and research projects towards the ZSM realization in 5G and beyond networks. Finally, several lessons learned from the literature and open research problems related to ZSM realization are also discussed in this paper.},

 abstract = {In the rapidly changing cybersecurity landscape, threat hunting has become a critical proactive defense against sophisticated cyber threats. While traditional security measures are essential, their reactive nature often falls short in countering malicious actors’ increasingly advanced tactics. This paper explores the crucial role of threat hunting, a systematic, analyst-driven process aimed at uncovering hidden threats lurking within an organization’s digital infrastructure before they escalate into major incidents. Despite its importance, the cybersecurity community grapples with several challenges, including the lack of standardized methodologies, the need for specialized expertise, and the integration of cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) for predictive threat identification. To tackle these challenges, this survey paper offers a comprehensive overview of current threat hunting practices, emphasizing the integration of AI-driven models for proactive threat prediction. Our research explores critical questions regarding the effectiveness of various threat hunting processes and the incorporation of advanced techniques such as augmented methodologies and machine learning. Our approach involves a systematic review of existing practices, including frameworks from industry leaders like IBM and CrowdStrike. We also explore resources for intelligence ontologies and automation tools. The background section clarifies the distinction between threat hunting and anomaly detection, emphasizing systematic processes crucial for effective threat hunting. We formulate hypotheses based on hidden states and observations, examine the interplay between anomaly detection and threat hunting, and introduce iterative detection methodologies and playbooks for enhanced threat detection. Our review encompasses supervised and unsupervised machine learning approaches, reasoning techniques, graph-based and rule-based methods, as well as other innovative strategies. We identify key challenges in the field, including the scarcity of labeled data, imbalanced datasets, the need for integrating multiple data sources, the rapid evolution of adversarial techniques, and the limited availability of human expertise and data intelligence. The discussion highlights the transformative impact of artificial intelligence on both threat hunting and cybercrime, reinforcing the importance of robust hypothesis development. This paper contributes a detailed analysis of the current state and future directions of threat hunting, offering actionable insights for researchers and practitioners to enhance threat detection and mitigation strategies in the ever-evolving cybersecurity landscape.},

In this modern era, with the advancements in manufacturing technologies, academia and industry have been given more interest in smart manufacturing for taking benefits for making their production more sustainable and effective. In the present study, the significant techniques of smart manufacturing, sustainable manufacturing, and additive manufacturing are combined to make a unified term of sustainable and smart additive manufacturing (SSAM). The paper aims to develop framework by combining big data analytics, additive manufacturing, and sustainable smart manufacturing technologies which is beneficial to the additive manufacturing enterprises. So, a framework of big data-driven sustainable and smart additive manufacturing (BD-SSAM) is proposed which helped AM industry leaders to make better decisions for the beginning of life (BOL) stage of product life cycle. Finally, an application scenario of the additive manufacturing industry was presented to demonstrate the proposed framework. The proposed framework is implemented on the BOL stage of product lifecycle due to limitation of available resources and for fabrication of AlSi10Mg alloy components by using selective laser melting (SLM) technique of AM. The results indicate that energy consumption and quality of the product are adequately controlled which is helpful for smart sustainable manufacturing, emission reduction, and cleaner production.},

Human decision-makers deal with more than one machine learning model in several practical situations. Consequently, the importance of understanding how two machine learning models work beyond their prediction performances is key to understanding their behaviour, differences, and likeness. Some attempts have been made to address these problems, for instance, by explaining text classifiers in a time-contrastive fashion. In this paper, we present MERLIN, a novel eXplainable AI approach that provides contrastive explanations of two machine learning models, introducing the concept of model-contrastive explanations. We propose an encoding that allows MERLIN to work with both text and tabular data and with mixed continuous and discrete features. To show the effectiveness of our approach, we evaluate it on an extensive set of benchmark datasets. MERLIN is also implemented as a python-pip package.},

 abstract = {Student dropout is a major concern in higher education, as it leads to direct economic losses and substantial social costs. Public and private institutions spend considerable resources to prevent student dropout. The efficiency and effectiveness of these investments, however, may be improved by adopting a profit-driven perspective. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for implementing student dropout prediction using data-driven methods. Extending upon profit metrics as used in business analytics, we design a novel performance measure for evaluating predictive models that is tailored to the student dropout problem and that quantifies the net savings of a retention campaign. This metric supports the identification and selection of students to optimally allocate the limited resources for preventing student dropout and to maximize the resulting savings. Experiments were performed using data from three bachelor's programs of a higher education institution containing information on dropouts and participation in a retention program, i.e., tutorials. The proposed metric allows for a better choice of prediction model and classification threshold than conventional approaches and, as a result, yields tangible savings for the institution. Finally, the presented approach and experimental results highlight pathways to design tailored student retention programs.},

 abstract = {Face stability is an essential issue in tunnel design and construction. Layered rock masses are typical and ubiquitous; uncertainties in rock properties always exist. In view of this, a comprehensive method, which combines the Upper bound Limit analysis of Tunnel face stability, the Polynomial Chaos Kriging, the Monte-Carlo Simulation and Analysis of Covariance method (ULT-PCK-MA), is proposed to investigate the seismic stability of tunnel faces. A two-dimensional analytical model of ULT is developed to evaluate the virtual support force based on the upper bound limit analysis. An efficient probabilistic analysis method PCK-MA based on the adaptive Polynomial Chaos Kriging metamodel is then implemented to investigate the parameter uncertainty effects. Ten input parameters, including geological strength indices, uniaxial compressive strengths and constants for three rock formations, and the horizontal seismic coefficients, are treated as random variables. The effects of these parameter uncertainties on the failure probability and sensitivity indices are discussed. In addition, the effects of weak layer position, the middle layer thickness and quality, the tunnel diameter, the parameters correlation, and the seismic loadings are investigated, respectively. The results show that the layer distributions significantly influence the tunnel face probabilistic stability, particularly when the weak rock is present in the bottom layer. The efficiency of the proposed ULT-PCK-MA is validated, which is expected to facilitate the engineering design and construction.},

 abstract = {A Microgrid (MG) is a promising distributed technology to solve todays energy challenges. They are changing how electricity is produced, transmitted, and distributed, enabling to capture massive amounts of data from sensors, and other electrical infrastructures. However, recent advances in modeling and optimization of MG neither integrate the use of big data technologies aggressively nor focus on developing an optimal operational strategy for a single building. To bridge this gap, this research proposes to use Apache Spark to enhance the performance of a scalable stochastic optimization model for an MG for multiple buildings, and to ensure that a significant portion of the wind power output will be utilized. The decision model is formulated as a chance constraint two-stage optimization problem to obtain operation decisions for a behind-the-meter topology. The comparison between the current practice of using historical data and integrating Apache Spark technologies demonstrates the superiority of the streaming data as energy management strategy. Experiments under different settings show that using big data strategy, the model can (1) achieve more cost savings of the total system, (2) increase resiliency to power disturbances, and (3) build a data analytics framework to enhance the decision-making process.},

To overcome these limitations, we ground this research on an exploratory study that captures eye-tracking data during a decision-making task of product selection. Grounded on the dynamic attention theory, we utilize different information types and formats present on a popular social commerce platform, to identify elements which are important when deciding about online product purchase decision. Specifically, we employ a series of prediction algorithms and use an ensemble learning setup to predict the aspects that contribute to product selection by consumers. Our analysis highlights the most important informational cues to accurately predict product selection among alternatives. In addition, the results showcase how such elements shift in importance during the temporal sequence of comparing different product alternatives. Our results provide insight into how we can understand the journey of decision-making for social commerce customers when navigating through information to select a product.

It has become a subject of high significance in all perspectives, mainly in the workstation. Consequently, the main objective for universities and schools is to develop future specialists for handling the problems and finding the effective outcomes by their digital competency as a significant ability. In higher education institutions, assessing the key drivers of digital transformation is a complicated decision-making problem as the multiple factors are involved in it. To this aim, a novel picture fuzzy information-based decision-making framework is proposed to assess the key drivers of digital transformation in higher education institutions. In this regard, an improved score function is proposed to rank the picture fuzzy numbers. In addition, it is used to determine the weights of decision experts. Next, some generalized Dombi aggregation operators are proposed to aggregate the picture fuzzy information. Further, an integrated criteria weighting model is presented based on the combination of objective weights through standard deviation-based model and subjective weights through pivot pairwise relative criteria importance assessment (PIPRECIA) model in the context of picture fuzzy sets. To rank the alternatives, a picture fuzzy extension of alternative ranking order model accounting for two step normalization (AROMAN) approach is proposed using the score function, Dombi operators and integrated weighting model. The usefulness of the proposed approach is illustrated using a case study of key drivers' assessment of digital transformation in higher education institutions.

 abstract = {Digital twins are a core industry 4.0 technology enabling the virtual replication of real-world objects, mimicking behaviours and states throughout their lifespan. While digital twins have shown significant benefits in industries such as manufacturing, transportation, and healthcare, their application in agriculture is still within its infancy. Their realisation also poses significant challenges, such as the creation of dynamic agricultural objects (e.g., plants). Existing literature on digital twins in agriculture identifies their limited ability to monitor physical objects without predictive capabilities and that there is a significant lack of 3D representations of plants with functional attributes. Yet, incorporating 3D representations of plants with underlying functionality in a digital twin can greatly improve growth, yield, and disease prediction accuracy. This enhancement enables various applications, such as assessing and developing pruning strategies, providing education to growers, guiding pruning robots, and optimizing spraying techniques. To that end, Functional Structural Plant Modelling presents a potential solution by representing the 3D architecture of plants and incorporating the functionality of different plant parts. By conducting a domain analysis of 3D plant phenotyping and FSPM, this study addresses the specific needs of digital twins in agriculture regarding FSPM. The investigation bridges the existing knowledge gap by identifying crucial concepts, including 3D plant modelling with underlying functionality and 3D plant phenotyping for digital twins. Specifically, a framework for 3D FSPM integration into agricultural digital twins is proposed. The framework not only acknowledges the associated requirements and challenges identified in existing literature but also lays foundation for the advancement of digital twins in the agricultural domain.},

 abstract = {Industry 4.0 promises to increase productivity and flexibility for the manufacturing industry, which translates into greater customer value and lower costs. Lean manufacturing has long championed principles and tools with a focus on value adding activities, elimination of waste and continuous improvement. Even the most successful lean manufacturing firms, in terms of efficiency and quality achieved through waste reduction, will acknowledge there is a lot of opportunity for improvement. This review evaluates how lean principles can support Industry 4.0 in pursuit of greater customer value and manufacturing excellence. Leveraging the opportunities that exist within Industry 4.0 umbrella of technologies can help to further reduce the nine wastes of lean. While large corporations have access to extensive capital markets and can capture economies of scale offered by leading edge technologies of Industry 4.0, small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) with greater capital restraints face the challenge of justifying Industry 4.0 technologies and cannot risk being at the bleeding edge of technology. Using a case study of a small electronics manufacturing firm, the opportunities, challenges, and the implementation strategy for technology are examined. This paper finds that SMEs pursuit of process efficiencies and waste reduction can be best achieved through a focus on foundational digitalization & data management then taking a stepwise approach towards the cyber-physical systems of Industry 4.0.},

 abstract = {By offering clients attractive credit terms on sales, a company may increase its turnover, but granting credit also incurs the cost of money tied up in accounts receivable (AR), increased administration and a heightened probability of incurring bad debt. The management of credit sales, although eminently important to any business, is often performed manually, which may be time-consuming, expensive and inaccurate. Such an administrative workload becomes increasingly cumbersome as the number of credit sales increases. As a result, a new approach towards proactively identifying invoices from AR accounts that are likely to be paid late, or not at all, has recently been proposed in the literature, with the aim of employing intervention strategies more effectively. Several computational techniques from the credit scoring literature and particularly techniques from the realms of survival analysis or machine learning have been embedded in the aforementioned approach. This body of work is, however, lacking due to the limited guidance provided during the data preparation phase of the model development process and because survival analytic and machine learning techniques have not yet been ensembled. In this paper, we propose a generic framework for modelling invoice payment predictions with the aim of facilitating the process of preparing transaction data for analysis, generating relevant features from past customer behaviours, and selecting and ensembling suitable models for predicting the time to payment associated with invoices. We also introduce a new sequential ensembling approach, called the Survival Boost algorithm. The rationale behind this method is that features generated by a survival analytic model can enhance the efficacy of a machine learning classification algorithm.},

 abstract = {The use of artificial neural network models to enrich the analytical and predictive capabilities of decision support systems in manufacturing has increased. The growing complexity and uncertainty in the manufacturing sector demand improved decision-making to ensure low operations costs, high productivity, and sustainable use of resources. Artificial neural networks have the inherent capacity to analyze the most uncertain and complex patterns in unstructured decision problems. This review aims to synthesize and provide a comprehensive summary of recent studies on artificial neural network-based decision support systems as applied in manufacturing processes. First, the specific processes in manufacturing where artificial neural network-based decision support systems are used are analyzed. A total of 99 multi-disciplinary publications on artificial neural network-based decision support systems published between 2011 and 2021 are retrieved and processed following a rigorous execution of the designated acceptance criteria and quality assessment. A review of the selected studies indicates a growing interest in applying artificial neural networks in decision support systems. Product and process design, performance evaluation, and predictive maintenance are the main application areas identified. A growing tendency to combine artificial neural network models with other intelligent tools, notably fuzzy logic, and genetic algorithm, is noted to overcome drawbacks such as slow convergence when training the algorithms. Further research should extend to other tools for enriching the performance of artificial neural networks in manufacturing processes.},

 abstract = {In order to give businesses useful information, the main goal of this study is to forecast future consumer purchases in the sustainable jewelry sector. Companies launching new goods, services, or modifications to their current offers must anticipate client behaviours. Businesses can learn a lot about how current customers behave by studying their behaviour in order to develop marketing and sales techniques that work. The study uses a variety of statistical and machine learning methods to forecast the most important elements influencing the purchasing of sustainable jewelry in order to achieve this. These variables span a wide range of characteristics, including gender, age, educational attainment, occupation, gross monthly income, marital status, previous jewelry purchase history, purchase intention, preferred shopping locations, online purchase influencers, consumer buying patterns, preferences for branded and non-branded jewelry, and participation in sustainable jewelry practices. In this study, supervised classification algorithms such Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine, Linear Discriminant Analysis, K-Nearest Neighbor, and Decision Tree are compared over a wide range of machine learning approaches. To increase the predictive model's effectiveness and resilience, ensemble learning techniques including Random Forest, AdaBoost, and Bagging Classifiers are also introduced. A confusion matrix and classification report are the performance indicators used to assess these models. When used on a test dataset, these measures evaluate the model's precision, recall, accuracy, and F1 scores. These measurable metrics are essential for evaluating the models' reliability and efficacy. Notably, the study shows that the approaches of Random Forest, Decision Tree, Bagging Classifier, and Linear Discriminant Analysis continuously produce the highest accuracy rates, all of which stand at a remarkable 100% accuracy. Other used machine learning classifiers, such as Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbor, Support Vector Machine, and AdaBoost algorithms, which provide significantly lower accuracy scores, fall short of this degree of accuracy. The Random Forest Classifier, which boasts a remarkable accuracy score of 100% for the training dataset and a reasonable 53% for the testing dataset, is particularly noteworthy. This classifier surpasses its competitors, demonstrating its potency in forecasting purchases of sustainable jewelry. In order to forecast sustainable jewelry purchases, this study uses a rigorous methodology that draws on a variety of statistical and machine learning models. The Random Forest Classifier is the most accurate and significant model for this predictive task, with Precision, Recall, and F1 scores of 100, according to the results, which were assessed using multiple performance measures like Precision, Recall, and F1 score.},

Industry reports indicate that it is not a matter of if but when organizations become victims of cyber-attacks or breaches. In this research, we argue that organizations must enable agility in their incident response (IR) to quickly respond to diverse cybersecurity threats, and big data analytics (BDA) plays a pivotal role in enabling agility in the IR. Drawing from dynamic capabilities theory, we conducted a field study using a case study approach to examine the following research question: What dimensions of big data analytics-embedded dynamic capabilities enable agility in cybersecurity incident response? We develop a framework that presents five key dimensions of BDA-embedded dynamic capabilities (data consolidation, threat intelligence, incident investigation, analytical skillset, and cybersecurity analytics warehouse) in IR at four specific stages, that is, manual analysis, basic analytics, advanced analytics, and pervasive analytics. The detail of the framework explains how BDA-embedded dynamic capabilities at the pervasive analytics stage enable agility in IR by infusing agile characteristics of flexibility, speed, and learning in IR. This study contributes to the knowledge of IT-embedded dynamic capabilities and cybersecurity IR agility. Detailed recommendations are also provided for potential practitioners.},

The emerging intelligent automation (IA) – the combination of RPA, AI and soft computing – can further transcend traditional DM to achieve unprecedented levels of operational efficiency, decision quality and system reliability. RPA allows an intelligent agent to eliminate operational errors and mimic manual routine decisions, including rule-based, well-structured and repetitive decisions involving enormous data, in a digital system, while AI has the cognitive capabilities to emulate the actions of human behaviour and process unstructured data via machine learning, natural language processing and image processing. Insights from IA drive new opportunities in providing automated DM processes, fault diagnosis, knowledge elicitation and solutions under complex decision environments with the presence of context-aware data, uncertainty and customer preferences.

 abstract = {To achieve zero waste and cumber the acute environmental effect of the building construction industry (BCI), circular economy (CE) implementation is pertinent. Such implementation requires the incorporation of certain actionable factors that are critical to its success. However, investigating these factors considering the individualistic variations of developed and developing economies is rarely conducted in the literature. Therefore, this study evaluated the critical success factors (CSFs) for attaining systemic circularity in the BCI of both developed and developing economies. The methodological framework adopted comprises a literature review and a questionnaire survey of 140 CE experts across 39 developed and developing economies. The data collected was analyzed using exploratory factor analysis (EFA), rank agreement analysis (RAA), and fuzzy synthetic evaluation (FSE) techniques. The EFA analysis revealed four principal success factors (PSFs): data-driven digital tools and circularity plan, capacity building and pre-demolition auditing, systemic circularity guidelines and commitment, and circular metric and secondary market development. The RAA results showed that consensus and non-consensus exist between the two groups (developed and developing economies) on the PSFs. The FSE method revealed that all the PSFs are paramount in achieving a successful CE implementation in the two economies. However, the top two in developed economies are systemic circularity guidelines and commitment, and circular metric and secondary market development, while data-driven digital tools and circularity plans, and capacity building and demolition monitoring are the top two in developing economies. The RAA findings underscore the need to be context conscious while adopting the CSFs for CE implementation in the BCI. The FSE findings and the PSF models developed would guide the government and management teams in resource allocation during CE implementation. This study contributes to existing knowledge by providing essential insights into the CSFs that would promote systemic circularity attainment in the BCI of developed and developing economies.},

 abstract = {Financial institutions benefit from the advanced predictive performance of machine learning algorithms in automatic decision-making for credit scoring. However, two main challenges hamper machine learning algorithms’ applicability in practice: the complex and black-box nature of algorithms that hinder their understandability and the inability to guide rejected customers to have a successful application. Regarding customer relationship management is one of the main responsibilities of financial institutions; they must clarify the decision-making process to guide them. However, financial institutions are not willing to disclose their decision-making procedure to prevent potential risks from customers or competitors side. Hence, in this study, a decision support framework is proposed to clarify the decision-making process and model strategic decision-making to guide rejected customers simultaneously. To do so, after classifying customers in their corresponding groups, the capability of Shapley additive exPlanations method is exploited to extract the most impactful features to the prediction’s outcome globally and locally. Then, based on the benchmarking approach, the equivalent approved peer is found for the rejected customer for target setting to modify the application. To find the optimal modified values for a counterfactual prediction, a multi-objective gamed-based counterfactual explanation model is developed using the prisoner’s dilemma game as the constraint to simulate strategic decision-making. After optimization, the decision is reported to the customers concerning the credential background. A public data set is used to elaborate on the proposed framework. This framework can generate counterfactual predictions successfully by modifying perspective features.},

Notably, artificial intelligence (AI) supported software development as well as software development in virtual reality environments have gained considerable prominence. This article introduces software development strategies to examine how software developers and companies respond to this transformation. Also, an advanced decision model is developed using the alternative ranking order method accounting for two-step normalization (AROMAN) method and further analyzed with the single-valued neutrosophic set-based AROMAN technique. The single-valued neutrosophic weighted Dombi Bonferroni operator is employed in the analysis process. This research offers two case studies investigating the preferences of developers and managers in software development strategies. The first case study examines the preferences of developers, while the second focuses on the preferences of managers. In both case studies, three fundamental software development methods are presented. These include the “traditional developers approach”, “AI-supported developers approach”, and “mixed reality and AI-supported developers approach”. These methods are ranked based on expert opinions concerning 10 criteria that influence the software development process. In both case studies, “output quality” is identified as the most influential criterion. From the perspective of software development methods, in both case studies, the “mixed reality and AI-supported developers approach” is identified as the most effective. Recommendations are provided for developers and managers. The findings also have significant implications for guiding developers and managers in making informed decisions and optimizing software development practices to align with the evolving AI and virtual reality landscape.},

 abstract = {Electricity consumers face challenges in selecting an optimal energy-saving plan, and this is a sustainability problem. To set consumers focus on sustainable energy management, developments around ”Industry 4.0” are needed to achieve an optimal balance between cost and energy consumption with a focus on cutting-edge machine-learning models and smart services introduction. Energy modelling is crucial for confronting the challenges introduced by the energy transition. This research is to promote digital twin (DT) technology in smart energy grids. The hybrid digital twin model is developed based on smart grid end-users’ electrical components. This approach emulates the component specification of the reference smart grid system and encourages a reduction in net energy consumption. Additionally, the application of AI connects smart meters, IoT devices, and the assets of the smart grids to the DT recreation of demand-side end-users for energy efficiency recommendation provision; this setup improves energy management, energy efficiency, and the usage of renewable energy resources. The novelty of this study is that the recent scope of demand-side recommendation schemes has been extended in the direction of cutting-edge Industry 4.0 hybrid DTs. Additionally, a prototype system and its functional characteristics have been proposed with the potential to pave the path for utilization in microgrid environments. Simulation results show a unique level of parallelism between the reference system and the developed model, along with a 36.8% reduction in net energy consumption following implementation of the recommendation advice.},

We propose a decision support system using Machine Learning (ML), swarm intelligence, and explainable artificial (XAI) techniques to assess students' performance. Our model employs Chaotic Particle Swarm Optimization (C-PSO) with Henon execution, outperforming Genetic Algorithm (GA), Ant Colony Optimization (ACO), Firefly Algorithm (FA), Bee Colony Optimization (BCO), Artificial Fish Swarm Algorithm (AFSA), Mayfly Optimization Algorithm (MFOA), Mother Optimization Algorithm (MOA), Fuzzy Self-Tuning PSO (FST-PSO). Evaluating efficiency, effectiveness, and solution quality reveals C-PSO's superiority. The study identifies the significant impact of ICT on self-progress and employs Spearman Rank correlation for statistical validation. Findings suggest C-PSO as an effective tool for optimizing educational data analysis and decision-making. Further exploration in real-world educational settings and comparative analyses with alternative optimization techniques are recommended for future research.},

 abstract = {A key aspect for a successful management of marine non-indigenous species (NIS) is the cooperation with local stakeholders. In this study we assessed stakeholders' baseline knowledge and perceptions on marine NIS foreseeing support for their management in the Azores and Madeira archipelagos (Portugal). Survey questionnaires were designed to assess: i) current knowledge and stakeholder perception of NIS and associated problems; ii) influence of communication media on NIS dissemination; iii) stakeholder willingness to be involved in NIS management actions and; iv) which factors predict stakeholder participation in NIS management actions. Face-to face survey questionnaires were administered in recreational marinas of São Miguel (Azores) and Madeira islands. Four groups of stakeholders classified based on their putative relation with NIS were selected as target. In total 214 survey questionnaires were collected and analysed. Our results showed no significant differences between stakeholders based in São Miguel and the ones from Madeira. Overall a strong baseline knowledge on NIS and associated consequences was found but a weak accuracy to identify NIS examples was demonstrated. Types of communication media revealed to be stakeholder-specific and information-specific. Decision tree predictive models showed three powerful factors to forecast the respondent's participation in NIS management actions: 1- to belong to one of the four stakeholder groups; 2- to have a good level of NIS knowledge; and 3- to have the perception that NIS introduction is an important issue. Despite the positive attitude exhibited by stakeholders in engaging NIS management, our results highlighted a consensus to attribute governmental responsibility to such activities. The results of this work constitute a baseline to develop further management actions aiming to reduce the local spread of marine NIS and so contributing to a better environmental status of Portuguese marine waters.},

 abstract = {Post-pandemic student performance prediction has gained considerable attention within the academic community. Educational institutions worldwide have adopted blended learning approaches for delivering education and assessments. In this study, we harnessed data from the ‘Offee’ assessment platform based in Mumbai, India, spanning from September 2020 to October 2022. This dataset allows us to analyze the real impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on examinations. To tackle the challenges posed by high-dimensional data, we employed feature selection techniques to retain only the most significant features for predicting student performance. Specifically, we assessed the effectiveness of two decision tree-based methods, J48 classifier and Random Forest, in conjunction with the ranker search method using wrapper subset evaluation. The resulting feature set was then utilized to train and test a Support Vector Machine model for predicting student performance. Our findings reveal that both J48 and Random Forest feature selection methods yield impressive precision accuracy rates for student performance prediction, achieving 93.14% and 86.24%, respectively. In contrast, using the dataset without feature selection resulted in lower precision accuracy, standing at 79.9%, and consumed more time during model training and development. In summary, this study underscores the significance of feature selection in enhancing the accuracy of student performance prediction compared to utilizing the dataset without such feature curation.},

Using predictive modeling can be instrumental for this task, as a means to identify dropouts proactively on the basis of student characteristics and their academic performance. To enhance these predictions, textual student feedback also might be relevant; this article proposes a hybrid decision support framework that combines predictive modeling with student segmentation efforts. A real-life data set from a French higher education institution, containing information of 14,391 students and 62,545 feedback documents, confirms the superior performance of the proposed framework, in terms of the area under the curve and top decile lift, compared with various benchmarks. In contributing to decision support system research, this study (1) proposes a new framework for automatic, data-driven segmentation of students based on textual data; (2) compares multiple text representation methods and confirms that incorporating student textual feedback data improves the predictive performance of student dropout models; and (3) establishes useful insights to help decision-makers anticipate and manage student dropout behaviors.},

Considering this trend, scholars have highlighted that uncritical deference to these systems would be problematic and consequently called for investigations of the impact of pertinent technology on humans' ethical decision-making. To this end, this article conducts a systematic review of existing scholarship and derives an integrated framework that demonstrates how intelligent decision-support systems (IDSSs) shape humans' ethical decision-making. In particular, we identify resulting consequences on an individual level (i.e., deliberation enhancement, motivation enhancement, autonomy enhancement and action enhancement) and on a societal level (i.e., moral deskilling, restricted moral progress and moral responsibility gaps). We carve out two distinct methods/operation types (i.e., process-oriented and outcome-oriented navigation) that decision-support systems can deploy and postulate that these determine to what extent the previously stated consequences materialize. Overall, this study holds important theoretical and practical implications by establishing clarity in the conceptions, underlying mechanisms and (directions of) influences that can be expected when using particular IDSSs for ethical decisions.},

 abstract = {The Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) is widely used in the cybersecurity industry to assess the severity of vulnerabilities. However, manual assessments and human error can lead to delays and inconsistencies. This study employs situational awareness theory to develop an automated decision support system, integrating perception, comprehension, and projection components to enhance effectiveness. Specifically, an interpretable principal component analysis (iPCA) combined with machine learning is utilized to forecast CVSS scores using text descriptions from the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) database. Different forecasting approaches, including traditional machine learning models, Long-Short Term Memory Neural Networks, and Transformer architectures (ChatGPT) are compared to determine the best performance. The results show that iPCA combined with support vector regression achieves a high performance (R2 = 98%) in predicting CVSS scores using CVE text descriptions. The results indicate that the variability, length, and details in the vulnerability description contribute to the performance of the transformer model. These findings are consistent across vulnerability descriptions from six companies between 2017 and 2019. The study's outcomes have the potential to enhance organizations' security posture, improving situational awareness and enabling better managerial decision-making in cybersecurity.},

 abstract = {The field of machine learning (ML) is sufficiently young that it is still expanding at an accelerating pace, lying at the crossroads of computer science and statistics, and at the core of artificial intelligence (AI) and data science. Recent progress in ML has been driven both by the development of new learning algorithms theory, and by the ongoing explosion in the availability of vast amount of data (often referred to as "big data") and low-cost computation. The adoption of ML-based approaches can be found throughout science, technology and industry, leading to more evidence-based decision-making across many walks of life, including healthcare, biomedicine, manufacturing, education, financial modeling, data governance, policing, and marketing. Although the past decade has witnessed the increasing interest in these fields, we are just beginning to tap the potential of these ML algorithms for studying systems that improve with experience. In this paper, we present a comprehensive view on geo worldwide trends (taking into account China, the USA, Israel, Italy, the UK, and the Middle East) of ML-based approaches highlighting the rapid growth in the last 5 years attributable to the introduction of related national policies. Furthermore, based on the literature review, we also discuss the potential research directions in this field, summarizing some popular application areas of machine learning technology, such as healthcare, cyber-security systems, sustainable agriculture, data governance, and nanotechnology, and suggest that the "dissemination of research" in the ML scientific community has undergone the exceptional growth in the time range of 2018–2020, reaching a value of 16,339 publications. Finally, we report the challenges and the regulatory standpoints for managing ML technology. Overall, we hope that this work will help to explain the geo trends of ML approaches and their applicability in various real-world domains, as well as serve as a reference point for both academia and industry professionals, particularly from a technical, ethical and regulatory point of view.},

 abstract = {Using machine learning algorithms in social environments and systems requires stricter and more detailed control. More specifically, the cost of error in such systems is much higher. Therefore, one should ensure that important decisions, such as whether to convict a person or not based on the previous criminal record, are by the legal requirements and not biased toward a group of people. One can find many many papers in the literature aimed at mitigating or eliminating unwanted bias in machine learning models. A significant part of these efforts add fairness constraint to the mathematical model or adds a regularization term to the loss function. In this paper, we show that optimizing the loss function given the fairness constraint or regularization for unfairness can surprisingly yield unfair solutions. This is due to the linear relaxation of the fairness function. By analyzing the gap between the true value of fairness and the one obtained using linear relaxation, we found that the gap can be as high as around 21% for the COMPAS dataset, and around 35% for the Adult dataset. In addition, we show that the fairness gap is consistent regardless of the strength of the fairness constraint or regularization.},

 abstract = {Applications of digital twin (DT) contribute to smart manufacturing via the integration of the cyber domain and the real world. Artificial Intelligence (AI) that is based on machine learning (ML) is generally recognized as being among the most promising technological developments in the manufacturing industry. Despite this, machine learning techniques call for enormous quantities of high-quality training datasets, and in the case of supervised ML, human labeling of such datasets is often necessary. Collecting and analyzing historical performance data to uncover operational insights has been a long-standing driver of efficiency and innovation for a wide variety of businesses, across all industrial sectors and even farther afield. However, the possible advantages of this method have not yet been leveraged to their maximum. There is a tendency for vast volumes of data, spanning anything from the current state of subsurface assets to the attitude that customers express on social media postings, to go mostly unrecorded and unanalyzed. This may be a problem for businesses. However, due to the limitations of existing IoT platforms in representing complex industrial machines, supporting production line-based application testing, and the lack of cost models for application cost/benefit analysis, the development of such Industry 4.0 applications is currently quite costly. Cyber Twins (CTs) are an extension of DTs that we propose using to facilitate the rapid and low-cost creation of Industry 4.0 applications. CTs may incorporate machine simulators and provide semantic descriptions of the machines they model, which makes it possible to test applications without putting the production line at risk or incurring additional costs. The applications for Industry 4.0 are based on CT and the accompanying cost models are the primary topics of this research. Second, the paper provides empirical results that connect existing academic literature to the interdependencies between edge components and internal and external services and systems in the Industry 4.0 paradigm. The novel aspect of this research is a new method for creating a DT, or a virtual representation that acts as the real-time digital counterpart of a physical object or process as defined by a conceptual model. This is the chapter’s primary contribution. The approach that was used to conduct the research for this article was conceptually similar to an investigation of complex, linked, and coupled systems using the grounded theory. This research provides an outline of how to increase AI development in IoT networks via integrating human-computer interactions across different knowledge management systems. These interactions take place in different information management systems. In addition, the previously used real-time controllable method has been improved, as well as optimized. Additionally, it performs simulation testing on the method in both a serial and a parallel fashion. The relevant mining time of the improved algorithm is shown to be substantially less than the time required by the conventional data mining method when applied to the same dataset, as shown by the test results when the ideal scenario of the parallel algorithm has been achieved. The amount of time required for conventional mining is around three and a half times as long as the amount of time required for data mining in this study, and the amount of power that the optimization method requires to operate has been decreased to 20W. With the help of AI, the manufacturing model (DT) and the decision support system are able to include all of the information generated by these subsystems. DT data technology facilitates the identification of pertinent information that can be processed and used to inform managerial decision-making. Applications of AI may open a wide variety of doors in the manufacturing industry, leading to the creation of new business models and the improvement of existing procedures. A formal model was used to define the landscape to guarantee the feasibility of conducting an in-depth analysis of the status and progression of the landscape, while taking into account DT and other technologies. The adoption of DT and Industrial Internet of Things for modeling of a real enterprise’s production process was taken into consideration. However, Digital Twin Store (DTS) has stricter standards, particularly in regard to the real-time engagement that is expected. A new technique that satisfies the aforementioned characteristics may be found in the use of AI, which is an efficient way of boosting the intelligence of the physical shop floor. In this piece of research, a conceptual framework for AI-enhanced DTS in interaction is presented. The real-time engagement is significantly increased by AI-enhanced DTS, thanks to its predictive control. The AI-enhanced interaction implementation technique in DTS is also discussed in length in this presentation. Finally, the DTS has implemented the necessary technology to support interaction.},

 abstract = {Oversampling is commonly used to improve classifier performance for small tabular imbalanced datasets. State-of-the-art linear interpolation approaches can be used to generate synthetic samples from the convex space of the minority class. Generative networks are common deep learning approaches for synthetic sample generation. However, their scope on synthetic tabular data generation in the context of imbalanced classification is not adequately explored. In this article, we show that existing deep generative models perform poorly compared to linear interpolation-based approaches for imbalanced classification problems on small tabular datasets. To overcome this, we propose a deep generative model, ConvGeN that combines the idea of convex space learning with deep generative models. ConvGeN learns coefficients for the convex combinations of the minority class samples, such that the synthetic data is distinct enough from the majority class. Our benchmarking experiments demonstrate that our proposed model ConvGeN improves imbalanced classification on such small datasets, as compared to existing deep generative models, while being on par with the existing linear interpolation approaches. Moreover, we discuss how our model can be used for synthetic tabular data generation in general, even outside the scope of data imbalance, and thus improves the overall applicability of convex space learning.},

 abstract = {This research introduces GeospatialVR, an open-source collaborative virtual reality framework to dynamically create 3D real-world environments that can be served on any web platform and accessed via desktop and mobile devices and virtual reality headsets. The framework can generate realistic simulations of desired locations entailing the terrain, elevation model, infrastructures, dynamic visualizations (e.g. water and fire simulation), and information layers (e.g. disaster damages and extent, sensor readings, occupancy, traffic, weather). These layers enable in-situ visualization of useful data to aid public, scientists, officials, and decision-makers in acquiring a bird's eye view of the current, historical, or forecasted condition of a community. The framework incorporates multiuser support to allow different stakeholders to remotely work on the same VR environment and observe other users' actions and 3D positions via avatars in real-time, and thus, presenting the potential to be utilized as a virtual incident command center or a meeting room. GeospatialVR's purpose is to enhance existing web-based cyberinfrastructure systems with the integration of immersive geospatial capabilities to assist the development of next-generation information and decision support systems powered by virtual reality. Finally, several case studies have been developed for flooding, wildfire, transportation, and public safety.},

We focus on hyperparameter tuning with various input parameters to obtain optimal ANN models. By segmenting data, the study identifies critical turnover predictors, allowing targeted interventions to be implemented to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of retention policies. Data augmentation using Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CTGAN) is performed on clusters with imbalanced data. Following this, the optimized ANN models are applied to these augmented clusters, leading to a notable improvement in their performance. We evaluate our optimized ANN models against five other ANN variants and four traditional machine learning models to demonstrate their superior accuracy and recall. The proposed approach achieves operational advantages by shifting away from generalized strategies to more focused, cluster-based policies, which can optimize resource utilization and reduce costs. Because of its practicality and enhanced ability to predict and manage employee turnover, this method, supported by empirical evidence, is a significant advancement in human resource (HR) analytics},

In this research, we conducted a systematic review and bibliometric analysis of the literature concerning fraud detection in financial statements. Following a bibliometric analysis, we identified the leading researchers, publications, sources, countries, and collaboration patterns in financial statement fraud detection. Our systematic review covered the following topics: the data analytics tools used, databases used to identify fraudulent firms, the design of control group samples (non-fraudulent firms), the critical dimension reduction tools used, techniques adopted to address data rarity (imbalanced data), explanatory variables used in the model, theoretical framework supporting the fraud indicators, optimization techniques used, the use of evaluation metrics, and significant findings. The systematic review followed the approach provided by Tranfield et al. (2003), and the bibliometric analysis was conducted using the VOSviewer. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA), 2020 reporting criteria were followed for reporting the systematic review's findings. We provide a brief overview of the existing literature, drawing both conclusions and recommendations for directions in which additional study is warranted. Our results provide valuable information that can be used by future academics, auditors, enforcement agencies, and regulators as they work to create the most effective fraud detection algorithms possible.},

Industry 4.0 (I4.0) is a promising lever; however, its future in supply chain risk management (SCRM) is highly uncertain and largely unexplored. This paper aims to evaluate I4.0′s potential to improve SCRES in a post-COVID-19 world. Based on current literature and multiple workshops, 13 future projections on potential I4.0 application areas in SCRM were developed. A two-round Delphi study among 64 SCRM experts with digital expertise was conducted to evaluate and discuss the projections regarding their probability of occurrence until 2030, their impact on SCRES, and their desirability. A fuzzy c-means algorithm was applied to cluster the projections based on the expert assessments. The expert evaluations led to three clusters on I4.0 application in SCRM: Four projections on generating data, increasing visibility, and building digital capabilities received considerable approval and are reliable to improve SCRES in 2030. Four projections enabling data sharing and processing were predominantly supported and demonstrated realization potential for 2030. Finally, five projections that require major supply network adaptations were deemed unlikely to improve SCRES in 2030. This paper answers several research calls by presenting empirical evidence on the pathway of I4.0 implementation in SCRM following the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, it evaluates a holistic set of technologies and indicates prioritization potentials to achieve SCRES improvements.},

Furthermore, we present the results of a case study, which highlight the utility of the technique for organisations.

Our approach considers both the rating score as well as the review text through a probabilistic topic modeling method, providing also a roadmap to quantify and exploit employee big data analytics. The novelty of this study lies in the coupling of structured and unstructured data for deriving managerial insights through a battery of econometric, financial and operational research methodologies.

 abstract = {There are many problems involved in the evaluation of variants of construction projects. One of the most difficult tasks is to establish evaluation criteria and assign them values, and afterwards to determine the degree to which the analyzed variants meet the criteria. This process is carried out based on opinions of experts, which usually constitute a large and heterogeneous set of data that is difficult to elaborate. As such, it raises most doubts and discussions among scientists. Therefore, the authors of this article propose to use a tool that can improve this process. The paper presents an example, and the Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) was used to solve the described problem. In the example, three variants were to be assessed and 17 criteria were used for the assessment, with the possibility of grouping them into four categories of main criteria. The developed ANFIS algorithm was implemented in the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) technology available in modern Nvidia graphics processors. The performance of the CUDA-ANFIS model was tested on several examples of real construction projects. It was found that the choice of the best investment option is not obvious when the final scores are the result of processing many thousands of data. In the evaluation process, fluctuations in the experts' responses may not only produce hard-to-distinguish final results, but may even reverse the order of the variants in the ranking. It has been shown that this will not happen if ANFIS is used to specifically filter both the input data and the intermediate results of the calculations. In addition, the use of CUDA technology speeds up calculations more than ten times. The new concept can be successfully applied to construct implicit decision models based on real data.},

However, the experts concentrated on a single topic of circular supply chain (CSC), CE, and I4.0, lacking a systemic approach to the integrated context. To this aim, the paper proposes a systematic literature review investigating and systematizing the knowledge around the circular SC domain enabled by CE and I4.0 and, simultaneously, highlighting the major trends. Starting from six dimensions of analysis (Type of contribution, LC phases, I4.0 technologies, Triple Bottom Line (TBL) layers, CE strategies, and SC typologies), CSC-related articles have been classified basing on five thematic categories (I4.0 enabling technologies, Performance tools and indicators, Challenges and barriers, Business models and strategies, Best practices). Results allowed to provide some peculiarities of each category. From a sustainability side, they confirmed a predominance of economic and environmental aspects over social ones, together with a life cycle perspective. From an I4.0 side, they shown a prevalence and a synergic implementation of internet of things, big data analytics, and cloud technologies. From a CE strategy side, reuse-recycle-remanufacturing, waste management, material and energy efficiency have been identified as prevalent topics. The paper contributes in building an integrated knowledge of the threefold CE, CSC and I4.0 research context. In addition, it proposes a theoretical framework useful to gradually guide practitioners in approaching the CSC transition.

Data from a survey of IT executives were analyzed to validate our proposed hypotheses. We found that while the infusion of ChatGPT in an organization moderates the relationship between ChatGPT incorporation and operational agility, infusion does not significantly impact market agilities. In addition, we found that a firm's ethical identity moderates ChatGPT-enabled market agilities but not operational agility.

 abstract = {The widespread adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT) and deep learning (DL) have facilitated a social paradigm shift towards smart cities, accelerating the rapid construction of smart facilities. However, newly constructed facilities often lack the necessary data to learn any predictive models, preventing them from being truly smart. Additionally, data collected from different facilities is heterogeneous or may even be privacy-sensitive, making it harder to train proactive maintenance management (PMM) models that are robust to provide services across them. These properties impose challenges that have not been adequately addressed, especially at the city level. In this paper, we present a privacy-preserving, federated learning (FL) framework that can assist management personnel to proactively manage the maintenance schedule of IoT-empowered facilities in different organizations through analyzing heterogeneous IoT data. Our framework consists of (1) an FL platform implemented with fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) for training DL models with time-series heterogeneous IoT data and (2) an FL-based long short-term memory autoencoder model, namely FedLSTMA, for facility-level PMM. To evaluate our framework, we did extensive simulations with real-world data harvested from IoT-empowered public toilets, demonstrating that the DL-based FedLSTMA outperformed other traditional machine learning (ML) algorithms and had a high level of generalizability and capabilities of transferring knowledge from existing facilities to newly constructed facilities under the situation of huge data heterogeneity. We believe that our framework can be a potential solution for overcoming the challenges inherent in managing and maintaining other smart facilities, ultimately contributing to the effective realization of smart cities.},

 abstract = {Consumer privacy protection has become an important issue and challenge in the development of e-commerce, and consumers' concerns for privacy may lead to negative user experiences and make them more cautious about disclosing personal information. As one of the widely adopted privacy concerns inhibiting approaches, the accumulated information privacy literature indicated that providing privacy controls may not always mitigate privacy concerns, implying that there are potential boundary conditions to be clarified. This study aims to explain the inconsistent effect of perceived privacy control on privacy concerns from the perspective of individual factor differences among consumers. We investigated the roles of trust, Internet privacy experience, and risk propensity in the relationship between perceived privacy control and privacy concerns. We collected empirical data containing 625 representative samples of Chinese consumers based on a mainstream online survey platform in China. The results suggest that trust in e-commerce partially mediates the influence of perceived privacy control on privacy concerns. Internet privacy experience positively moderates the relationship between perceived privacy control and trust in e-commerce, and both Internet privacy experience and risk propensity negatively moderate the relationship between trust in e-commerce and privacy concerns. This study extends existing information privacy and trust literature through the analysis of the mediating effect of trust and the moderating effects of consumers' individual factors. We also discuss the potential positive and negative implications of this research.},

 abstract = {Accurate measurement of crop evapotranspiration (ETc) and soil moisture content (SMC) is critical for different purposes, including developing irrigation scheduling practices that improve water use efficiency and crop yield. The objectives of this study were to 1) simulate daily ETc and SMC of green beans and sweet corn under full irrigation and three deficit irrigation rates using the Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) CROPGRO-Green bean and CERES–Sweet corn models and 2) evaluate the performance of three machine learning models for simulating ETc of green beans and sweet corn. The DSSAT models were calibrated using measured phenological, biomass, and yield data collected during two years of experiments at the University of Florida, Tropical Research and Education Center (TREC) during the winter (dry) seasons of 2020–21 and 2021–22. The experiments were conducted under four irrigation treatments: 100% full irrigation (FI), 75% FI, 50% FI, and 25% FI, with four replications. The simulated daily ETc and SMC under each irrigation treatment were compared with estimated ETc based on changes in SMC and measured SMC, respectively. Estimating ETc based on changes in SMC involved quantifying sub-hourly moisture loss during the drying phase of soil and aggregating the results into daily timesteps. The eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), light gradient-boosting machine (LightGBM), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) models were trained using SMC and weather variables to simulate daily ETc of green beans and sweet corn. The results showed that the CROPGRO and CERES models could reasonably simulate SMC dynamics of green beans and sweet corn plots. The models simulated SMC better for the three deficit irrigation treatments than the full irrigation treatment. The CROPGRO model evaluation index of agreement (d-Stat) and mean absolute error (MAE) for 25% FI treatment were 0.72 and 0.03 cm3 cm−3, and 0.75 and 0.03 cm3 cm−3 for the CERES model. However, the DSSAT models did not perform well in simulating ETc for green beans and sweet corn. Average d-Stat and MAE for the CROPGRO during model evaluation were 0.5- and 1.0-mm day−1 and 0.6- and 1.1-mm day−1 for CERES, respectively. The performance of all machine learning (ML) models for simulating daily ETc of green beans and sweet corn was better than the CROPGRO and CERES models. Incorporating machine learning algorithms into the DSSAT model has the potential to enhance its performance in simulating ETc. Overall, the results suggest that DSSAT and ML models could potentially be used as alternative decision support tools for assessing and managing irrigation strategies and optimizing water use efficiency under different management and environmental conditions.},

 abstract = {Background
Clinician-led quality control into oncological decision-making is crucial for optimising patient care. Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) techniques provide data-driven approaches to unravel how clinical variables influence this decision-making. We applied global XAI techniques to examine the impact of key clinical decision-drivers when mapped by a machine learning (ML) model, on the likelihood of receiving different oesophageal cancer (OC) treatment modalities by the multidisciplinary team (MDT).
Methods
Retrospective analysis of 893 OC patients managed between 2010 and 2022 at our tertiary unit, used a random forests (RF) classifier to predict four possible treatment pathways as determined by the MDT: neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery (NACT + S), neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery (NACRT + S), surgery-alone, and palliative management. Variable importance and partial dependence (PD) analyses then examined the influence of targeted high-ranking clinical variables within the ML model on treatment decisions as a surrogate model of the MDT decision-making dynamic.
Results
Amongst guideline-variables known to determine treatments, such as Tumour-Node-Metastasis (TNM) staging, age also proved highly important to the RF model (16.1 % of total importance) on variable importance analysis. PD subsequently revealed that predicted probabilities for all treatment modalities change significantly after 75 years (p < 0.001). Likelihood of surgery-alone and palliative therapies increased for patients aged 75–85yrs but lowered for NACT/NACRT. Performance status divided patients into two clusters which influenced all predicted outcomes in conjunction with age.
Conclusion
XAI techniques delineate the relationship between clinical factors and OC treatment decisions. These techniques identify advanced age as heavily influencing decisions based on our model with a greater role in patients with specific tumour characteristics. This study methodology provides the means for exploring conscious/subconscious bias and interrogating inconsistencies in team-based decision-making within the era of AI-driven decision support.},

The literature review reveals that NFS classification methods are based on NFS architecture, learning algorithm, fuzzy method, and application area. This paper systematically categorizes CEM application domains (decision making, prediction/forecasting, evaluation/assessment, system modeling and analysis, simulation, and optimization) and maps them to NFS based on their suitability, which is determined using the performance evaluation criteria of convergence speed, computational complexity, interpretability, accuracy, and local minima trapping.},

 abstract = {Travel location recommendation systems have long been used by travellers for their ability to suggest destinations and potential travel experiences that match travellers' desires. Recently, a new type of domestic travel has emerged, namely domestic overseas-like travel experiences. These experiences are attractive to travellers who have a preference for exotic locations but no desire to travel internationally. Existing travel recommendation systems were not designed for such applications, nor do they have the relevant ability to recommend domestic overseas-like travel experiences to support travel decision making. To address this challenge, this paper focuses on the development of a recommendation model based on the visual content of photos for domestic overseas-like travel experiences and a prototype application. The application uses the latest advancement in computer vision — the concept model — to learn high-level concepts in an overseas travel destination photo collection to identify similar domestic travel experiences. We demonstrate the usability of the prototype application with a large-scale data set of approximately 479,000 travel photos taken in several countries and evaluate its utility and efficacy through four focus groups with target users.},

 abstract = {This paper presents a new hybrid forecasting model to predict the final time and cost of a project using input parameters from the project scheduling and risk analysis literature. The hybrid method integrates two well-known risk models. A Structural Equation Modeling constructs and validates a theoretical risk model to represent known relations between project indicators and the project performance. A Bayesian Networks is used to train the theoretical model using artificial project data from the literature. These two integrated models are then used to predict the final duration and cost of a new unseen project. The accuracy of this integrated model is compared with other well-known forecasting methods from the literature. The computational experiments on a set of 33 empirical projects show that risk models demonstrate a noteworthy advantage for time and cost forecasting. To show the usefulness of this method, it is compared with a set of known machine learning forecasting algorithms. These static predictions of risk models are also compared with some well-known dynamic forecasting methods that continuously update the time/cost predictions along the project progress. These dynamic models make use of predictors from the earned value management and earned duration management literature. The results show that the static risk models offer more precise forecasts than the dynamic methods in the first half of the project progress for time forecasting, but then loose their power in favor of the dynamic forecasts.},

Focusing on the contributions of information systems research, we conducted a literature review to distinguish papers on DPKW from related types of digital platforms, to synthesize what we know about knowledge work on DPKW, and to guide future research. Based on a comprehensive literature search, we derived five boundary conditions, which constitute our definition of DPKW: digitality, value network paradigm, centralized governance, contractual work, and knowledge work. We further developed a conceptual process framework of the constituent processes of DPKW. With this framework, we elaborate on an established process model to distinguish the three macro­level processes of matching, contracting, and executing. We further examined micro­level processes suggested in extant research based on a process linking approach in order to understand how they synchronically instantiate each macro­level process. Emphasizing the significance of the micro­ and macro­level processes and the emergent stage of the literature on DPKW, we offer an agenda for future research and outline implications for practice.},

 abstract = {In an Industry 4.0 Factory, physical entities such as humans, machines and materials are digitized into digital twins (DT) with smart IoT (Internet of Things) devices resulting in Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPS). Real-time data analytics builds up traceability and visibility, not only in the physical domain but also cyber space. This paper adds a new concept of cyber-physical inventory or simply meta-inventory to Industry 4.0 CPPS. In addition to physical items, their digital twins are considered as part of production inventory. Traceability and visibility enabled by digital twin can significantly reduce complexity and uncertainties (e.g. lead times and variability) while achieving resilience in case of major disturbances. The CPPS factory hedges the risks through meta-inventory without incurring cost for holding inventory digitally. After reflecting upon the developments of production inventory management corresponding to the evolutionary history of manufacturing systems to Industry 4.0, the paper presents the meta-inventory paradigm within a simple Industry 4.0 compliant supply chain. The factory, the supplier, and the transport implement a VMI (vendor-managed inventory) strategy. Two well-known basic EOQ (Economic Order Quantity) and EPQ (Economic Production Quantity or production Lot Sizing) problems are extended to demonstrate and quantify the impacts of using meta-inventory on the supply chain and the member enterprise. The analyses allow us to unfold key perspectives in more complex production and supply chain systems for further research.},

 abstract = {Financial statement fraud caused by listed companies directly jeopardizes the reliability the financial reporting process. Leveraging multimodal information for financial statement fraud detection (FSFD) has recently become of great interest to academic research and industrial applications. Unfortunately, the predictive ability of multimodal information in FSFD remains largely underexplored, particularly the fusion ambiguity embedded in and among multi-modalities. In this study, we propose a novel attention-based multimodal deep learning method, named RCMA, toward an accurate FSFD. RCMA synthesizes a fine-grained attention mechanism including three innovative attention modules, i.e., ratio-aware attention, chapter-aware attention, and modality-aware attention mechanism. The first two attention mechanisms help to liberate the extraordinary predictive power of the financial modality and the textual modality on FSFD, respectively. Moreover, the proposed modality-aware attention mechanism enables better coordination between the two modalities. Furthermore, to ensure effective learning on the attention-based multimodal embedding, we design a novel loss function named Focal and Consistency Loss, or FCL. It considers class-imbalance and modality-consistency simultaneously, to specialize the optimization of FSFD. The experimental results on the real-world dataset show that the proposed RCMA on FSFD task outperformed the state-of-the-art benchmarks. Furthermore, interpretation analysis visualizes the attention weights of different ratio groups, chapters, and modalities from RCMA, and illustrates how these interpretations influence stakeholders' decision process for FSFD.},

 abstract = {Achieving simultaneous and precise prediction of multiple product performance indicators is crucial to ensure stable production in the continuous annealing process. However, the majority of existing quality prediction modeling methods concentrate on developing single-output regression models that are limited to single-indicator prediction scenarios. When dealing with the multi-indicator prediction scenarios, these methods usually require the construction of a separate model for each performance indicator, which leads to more computational and storage resources and more complex maintenance in practical applications. To address this issue, a dual-population multiobjective co-evolutionary matching ensemble learning method called DP-CEMEL is developed. It utilizes dual-population co-optimization to enable the joint learning of the algorithm on input–output relationships and inter-indicator correlations. More specifically, a two-stage learning based individual encoding and decoding method and a performance boosting degree (PBD) based individual evaluation strategy are designed to achieve co-optimization of the dual populations to evolve a set of individuals (i.e., base learners) with good accuracy and low complexity. Then, a PBD based matching ensemble method is applied to get the final multi-indicator prediction model by the optimal matching and ensemble of the evolved individuals. Experimental results on both benchmark data and practical strip production data demonstrate that the proposed DP-CEMEL attains competitive or better performance compared to other state-of-the-art learning methods.},

One of these methods is the Characteristic Objects Method (COMET), which uses expert knowledge to calculate preference values when creating a rule base. The number of Characteristic Objects (COs) pairs necessary to perform comparisons depends on the model’s structure, the number of criteria and characteristic values. In this paper, it was decided to build a complex MCDM model based on the COMET method, which was used to predict the chances of overtaking during pit stops in Formula 1 races. To improve the performance of the model and reduce the necessary pairwise comparisons of COs, it was decided to split the structure into submodels aggregating criteria with similar characteristics to reduce the complexity of the problem. Additionally, the influence of each criterion on the obtained preference values and the final result was examined. By restructuring the model, it was possible to reduce the number of comparisons while maintaining the designed model’s correct operation.},

 abstract = {Currently, universities are being forced to change the paradigms of
education, where knowledge is mainly based on the experience of the
teacher. This change includes the development of quality education
focused on students' learning. These factors have forced universities to
look for a solution that allows them to extract data from different
information systems and convert them into the knowledge necessary to
make decisions that improve learning outcomes. The information systems
administered by the universities store a large volume of data on the
socioeconomic and academic variables of the students. In the university
field, these data are generally not used to generate knowledge about
their students, unlike in the business field, where the data are
intensively analyzed in business intelligence to gain a competitive
advantage. These success stories in the business field can be replicated
by universities through an analysis of educational data. This document
presents a method that combines models and techniques of data mining
within an architecture of business intelligence to make decisions about
variables that can influence the development of learning. In order to
test the proposed method, a case study is presented, in which students
are identified and classified according to the data they generate in the
different information systems of a university.},

 abstract = {Purpose In this paper, the challenging and thorny issue of assessing
graduate attributes (GAs) is addressed. An interdisciplinary team at The
University of Alberta ----developed a formative model of assessment
centered on students and instructor interaction with course content.
Design/methodology/approach The paper starts by laying the theoretical
groundwork on which this novel GA assessment tool is based, that is,
competency-based education, assessment theory and GA assessment. It
follows with a description of the online assessment tool for GAs that
was developed in the course of this project. Findings The online
assessment tool for GAs targets three types of stakeholders: (1)
students, who self-assess in terms of GAs, (2) instructors, who use the
tool to define the extent to which each GA should be inculcated in their
course and (3) administrators, who receive aggregate reports based on
the data gathered by the system for high-level analysis and
decision-making. Collected data by students and professors advance
formative assessment of these transversal skills and assist
administration in ensuring the GAs are addressed in academic programs.
Graduate attributes assessment program (GAAP) is also a space for
students to build a personal portfolio that would be beneficial to
highlight their skills for potential employers. Research
limitations/implications This research has strong implications for the
universities, since it can help institutions, academics and students
achieve better results in their practices. This is done by demonstrating
strong links between theory and practice. Although this tool has only
been used within the university setting by students, instructors and
administrators (for self-, course and teaching and program improvement),
it could increase its social and practical impact by involving potential
employers and increase our understanding of student employability.
Moreover, because the tool collects data on a continuous basis, it lends
itself to many possible applications in educational data mining,
Practical implications The GAAP can be used and adapted to various
educational contexts. The plugin can be added to any Learning Management
System (LMS), and students can have access to their data and results
throughout their education. Social implications The GAAP allows
institutions to provide a longitudinal formative assessment of students'
graduate attributes acquisition. It provides solid and valid evidence of
students' progress in a way that would advance society and citizenship.
Originality/value To date, the GAAP is the first online interactive
platform that has been developed to longitudinally assess the
acquisition of GAs during a complete academic cycle/cohort. It provides
a unique space where students and instructors interact with assessment
scales and with concrete data for a complete university experience

 abstract = {Managing student dropout in higher education is critical, considering
its substantial impacts on students' lives, academic institutions, and
society as a whole. Using predictive modeling can be instrumental for
this task, as a means to identify dropouts proactively on the basis of
student characteristics and their academic performance. To enhance these
predictions, textual student feedback also might be relevant; this
article proposes a hybrid decision support framework that combines
predictive modeling with student segmentation efforts. A real-life data
set from a French higher education institution, containing information
of 14,391 students and 62,545 feedback documents, confirms the superior
performance of the proposed framework, in terms of the area under the
curve and top decile lift, compared with various benchmarks. In
contributing to decision support system research, this study (1)
proposes a new framework for automatic, data-driven segmentation of
students based on textual data; (2) compares multiple text
representation methods and confirms that incorporating student textual
feedback data improves the predictive performance of student dropout
models; and (3) establishes useful insights to help decision-makers
anticipate and manage student dropout behaviors.},

 abstract = {The paper highlights the importance of using data -driven
decision-making tools in Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) to improve
academic performance and support sustainable development. HEIs must
utilize data analytics tools, including educational data mining,
learning analytics, and business intelligence, to extract insights and
knowledge from educational data. These tools can help HEIs' leadership
monitor and improve student enrolment campaigns, track student
performance, evaluate academic staff, and make data-driven decisions.
Although decision support systems have many advantages, they are still
underutilized in HEIs, leaving field for further research and
implementation. To address this, the authors summarize the benefits of
applying data-driven decision approaches in HEIs and review various
frameworks and methodologies, such as a course recommendation system and
an academic prediction model, to aid educational decision-making. These
tools articulate pedagogical theories, frameworks, and educational
phenomena to establish mainstay significant components of learning to
enable the scheming of superior learning systems. The tools can be
utilized by the placement agencies or companies to find out their
probable trainees/ recruitees. They can help students in course
selection, and educational management in being more efficient and
effective.},

Thereby, the education and further training of employees can be seen as one of the major prerequisites to understand, handle, and further develop existing Industry 4.0 concepts and technologies. This paper reviews the current state of the art regarding the usage of learning labs, as modern teaching and learning methods, for industrial logistics engineering education from a holistic perspective. Moreover, the authors discuss learning within the framework of action-based learning approaches as a reflected form of meaningful social interaction and introduce an exemplary system-theoretical and constructivist approach based on the LOGILAB at the Montanuniversitaet Leoben.},

 abstract = {Effective financial distress prediction (FDP) can discover a company's potential financial risks and support relevant decisions in a timely manner. Previous studies on FDP have mostly focused on using financial indicators and periodic reports. Compared with periodic reports, current reports disclose major events in a timelier manner. But leveraging the information in current reports involves the critical challenges of capturing the complex semantics and measuring the importance of heterogeneous events. To this end, we propose a novel deep learning method, a user-response-guided deep attention network (URGDAN), to predict financial distress using current reports. In the proposed method, we construct a deep learning architecture to integrate financial indicators, current report texts, and user responses. URGDAN leverages the user responses to current reports to guide the semantic feature representation of the reports, it also identifies event information that has a significant correlation with company financial distress. Empirical evaluation shows that URGDAN significantly improves predictive performance and can accurately determine the importance of different current reports. Our work provides practical implications for creditors and investors.},

 abstract = {Recent advances in information, communication, and environmental monitoring technologies have increased the availability, spatiotemporal resolution, and quality of water-related data, thereby leading to the emergence of many innovative big data applications. Among these applications, visualization and visual analytics, also known as the visual computing techniques, empower the synergy of computational methods (e.g., machine learning and statistical models) with human reasoning to improve the understanding and solution toward complex science and engineering problems. These approaches are frequently integrated with geographic information systems and cyberinfrastructure to provide new opportunities and methods for enhancing water resources management. In this paper, we present a comprehensive review of recent hydroinformatics applications that employ visual computing techniques to (1) support complex data-driven research problems, and (2) support the communication and decision-makings in the water resources management sector. Then, we conduct a technical review of the state-of-the-art web-based visualization technologies and libraries to share our experiences on developing shareable, adaptive, and interactive visualizations and visual interfaces for water resources management applications. We close with a vision that applies the emerging visual computing technologies and paradigms to develop the next generation of hydroinformatics applications.},

 abstract = {This study explores the factors influencing AI adoption in professional service firms. Grounded in the Technological-Organizational-Environmental (TOE) framework, we employed a qualitative, multiple case study approach, investigating three auditing firms of varying sizes through interviews and secondary document reviews. Our findings reveal six factors influencing AI adoption, including technology affordances and constraints, the firm's innovation management approaches and AI readiness, the competition environment, and the regulatory environment. Noteworthily, these factors vary significantly among the three firms. Larger firms, often operating in an environment with high AI penetration, primarily perceive the operating affordance of AI rather than marketing affordance. This means their AI adoption encompasses greater scale and depth than smaller firms. However, this expansive adoption exposes them to a widening gap in regulatory frameworks, hindering AI adoption. Moreover, smaller firms are characterized by weaker AI readiness, positioning them disadvantageously to mitigate the constraints imposed by AI. This study contributes to existing literature by offering a more holistic perspective on AI adoption in professional services.},

We then introduce a taxonomy of the approaches associated with implementing these technologies in military scenarios. Furthermore, we discuss relevant factors for the seamless integration of data-centric technologies into military decision-making processes, and reveal the importance of specialized personnel, architectures, and cybersecurity issues in the task of developing prototypes and models. The findings of this paper aim to provide valuable insights for military institutions, offering a deeper understanding of the use of data-centric technologies as innovative practices to enhance the effectiveness of military decision-making.},

 abstract = {Curiously, there are few contributions in the scientific literature on the subject of artificial intelligence (AI) and its impact on aeronautics. However, many communications and reports have been published by aeronautic companies about their applications of AI technologies. This article makes an industry-wide review of AI in aeronautics using a three-step sequential approach: (i) a review of AI and its concepts to define and develop a conceptual map; (ii) a selection of 100 use cases from aeronautics companies that use AI technologies (e.g., Airbus, Boeing, Air France, Safran, EasyJet, Dassault Aviation, Altair); and (iii) an analysis of the use cases using the topics defined in the conceptual map. The main results describe a rising interest in the integration of AI technologies by entities in the aeronautic sector. Moreover, the results from the use cases show that the most recurrent technologies are big data analytics, autonomous intelligent systems, predictive analytics, machine learning, and robotics. Another finding is related to the several benefits that motivate companies to integrate AI technologies into their industrial and operational processes. The most frequent benefits include customer satisfaction, saving time, safety and security, cost reduction, better decision making, solving complex problems, and ensuring optimisation and efficiency. It also appears that the performance of companies is positively impacted by using these AI technologies. Such impacts span all operational departments including marketing, where these technologies help satisfy customer needs; the industrial and operational area, which is provided with quality products; and where productivity and economic performance are optimised for more efficiency.},

 abstract = {Although projects are regularly exposed to disruptive events, the literature lacks an effective measurement system for project resilience. This gap presents challenges for decision makers because of the consequent lack of quantitative information about the level of resilience and its impact on project performance throughout a project's life. We argue that managers can be supported by a priori information about past similar projects as well as new data that evolve during disruption and recovery stages to enhance decision making by key project leaders, such as funders when approving new projects, project managers when developing the detailed plan, and project owners when approving corrective actions following a major disruption. Therefore, this paper develops a mathematical model to measure the level of project resilience by predicting disruption and recovery profiles based on past similar completed projects, as well as actual events unique to the project at hand. We illustrate and validate the model based on a portfolio of 43 major projects that faced disruptions from various sources. Our results provide the first empirical evidence to measure the impact of project resilience on the disruption and recovery behavior of real-life projects. The outputs of this research can be used as a decision support system that enables managers to make informed decisions throughout a project's life.},

 abstract = {Predicting the success of a business venture has always been a struggle for both practitioners and researchers. However, thanks to companies that aggregate data about other firms, it has become possible to create and validate predictive models based on an unprecedented amount of real-world examples. In this study, we use data obtained from one of the largest platforms integrating business information – Crunchbase. Our final training set consisted of 213 171 companies. This work aims to create a predictive model based on machine learning for the purpose of forecasting a company’s success. Many similar attempts have been made in recent years. Plenty of those experiments, often conducted with the use of data gathered from several different sources, reported promising results. However, we found that very often they were significantly biased by their use of data containing information that was a direct consequence of a company reaching some level of success (or failure). Such an approach is a classic example of the look-ahead bias. It leads to very optimistic test results, but any attempt at using such an approach in a real-world scenario may result in dramatic consequences. We designed our experiments in a way that would prevent the leaking of any information unavailable at the decision moment to the training set. We compared three algorithms – logistic regression, support vector machine, and the gradient boosting classifier. Despite the conscious decision to limit the number of predictors, we reached very promising results in terms of precision, recall, and F1 scores which, for the best model, were 57%, 34%, and 43% respectively. The best outcomes were obtained with the gradient boosting classifier. We give detailed information about the importance of different features, with the top three being country and region that the company operates in and the company’s industry.

 abstract = {Spatial-temporal decision support systems (STDSS) serve as a crucial strategy for enhancing operational governance and mitigating risk within construction logistics. However, construction supply chains involve many opaque stakeholders, hindering whole industry compliance monitoring. This research formulates a tripartite evolutionary game model that scrutinizes the strategic interactions among government regulators, carriers, and contractors, thereby offering insights into the collaborative supervision outcomes shaped by these stakeholder engagements. Government regulators choose intelligent supervision incentives versus regular oversight. Carriers decide whether to invest in STDSS or not. Contractors cooperate by enrolling or declining STDSS. As key STDSS investors, carriers’ decisions are investigated under varying risk preferences in an extension model. This examines how government incentives influence long-term intelligent supervision and risk aversion behavior emergence to improve safety and quality across construction supply chains. Our findings indicate that increased adverse events motivate government regulators to adopt STDSS incentives for oversight, though carriers and contractors are not necessarily prompted to implement STDSS themselves. Escalating risk aversion reduces carrier STDSS adoption likelihood as they maintain basic services. Carriers perceiving contractor free riding as unfair competition also demotivates STDSS rollout. Although larger subsidies initially raise STDSS implementation probability, carriers become unwilling to adopt STDSS over time even with greater subsidies. In summary, adverse events drive regulator but not necessarily carrier and contractor STDSS adoption, while risk aversion, perceived fairness and changing subsidy effectiveness over time shape carrier decisions.},

 abstract = {Extensive efforts have been made by both academics and practitioners to understand the inter-firm competitive relationship owing to its profound impacts on multiple key business goals, e.g., company benchmarking, marketing strategy planning, and talent acquisition. However, it has never been an easy task to fully characterize firms and assess the competitive relationship among them, mainly due to the challenge of information heterogeneity. In this regard, we propose a novel IT artifact for firm profiling and inter-firm competition assessment guided by Information System Design Theory (ISDT). We start by constructing a Heterogeneous Occupation Network (HON) using employees’ occupation details and educational attainments. Then we adopt a Metapath2vec-based heterogeneous network embedding model to learn firms latent profiles (embeddings). Using the firm features and embeddings as input, we train multiple supervised classifiers to assess the competitive relationship among the firms. Following the principles of design as a search process, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our IT artifact through extensive experimental studies and detailed discussions. Our research has also discovered that the occupation and education specifics of employees are key factors in identifying potential competitors of a focal firm.},

 abstract = {Supply chains are immersed in extremely complex and dynamic environments. Reducing uncertainty and improving decision making by means of data-driven supply chain management (SCM) has increasingly become an indispensable core of organizational management. To implement data-driven SCM, companies need to possess the right skilled employees. Job advertisements in the field of data-driven SCM come with multiple different titles, sets of tasks, requirements, and desired soft skills. Therefore, determining which job profile typically inherits which specific requirements, tasks and soft skills presents a challenging task. To illuminate this question, we analyzed the entire Austrian SCM job market and extracted all available job profiles, their specific tasks, requirements, and basic salaries. Analyzing these data, we give recommendations about which qualifications and skills an applicant should inherit for a specific job profile. Additionally, we highlight which tasks typically need to be performed and what minimum salaries can be expected for the specific job profiles. Thus, our results help companies to specify their job advertisements in the field of data-driven SCM and provide job applicants with an overview of tasks they can expect, requirements they need to fulfill, and skills they need to acquire. From a scientific point of view, our results contribute to the body of knowledge by providing insights into the Austrian SCM domain, by offering starting points on how to adapt training and education programs and research projects in the university sector.},
