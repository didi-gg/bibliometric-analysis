 abstract = {The evolution of educational software applications has revolutionised teaching and learning methodologies in primary and secondary education over the past decade. This paper conducts a review of primary studies based on N = 21 papers published between 2013 and 2023, focusing on the diverse landscape of software applications designed for student learning, curriculum development, delivery, and assessment. Findings from this study showcases a range of software solutions ranging from assessment tools to tutoring applications. Distinctive features supporting various aspects of teaching and learning, including lesson planning, delivery, management, assessment, and self-directed learning, were also identified. Regarding the features of software solutions used in primary and secondary schools, some differences were identified in terms of complexity, interactivity, assessment methodologies, and the collaborative functionalities of these tools. While highlighting the potential benefits, findings from this study also showed that challenges such as deployment costs, user self-efficacy, and technology anxiety are influential factors affecting the adoption of these technologies in primary and secondary educational settings. The evidence presented in this study serves as a resource for educational leaders and practitioners, facilitating a deeper understanding of available educational tools and essential considerations in the design and adoption of future tools.},

 abstract = {Learning analytics dashboards (LADs) are intended to give relevant information to students and other stakeholders to inform potential next steps in the learning process. The current study examines the relationship between information indirectly presented through academic advisors' use of LADs, and college students' academic motivation, self-regulated learning, and academic achievement. We modeled how changes in student motivation and self-regulated learning (SRL) were related to what occurred during 1-on-1 meetings with academic advisors during which students had the potential to view representations of their achievement embedded within an Early Warning System (EWS) that visually represented aspects of their academic performance referenced with course averages. Constructs associated with SRL were moderated by advisor-advisee meetings. Results indicated that advisors' use of EWS while they met with students was negatively associated with the rate of decrease of students' reporting of using memorizing strategies but positively related when students' performance was compared to that of their peers. We discuss the moderating effects of students’ exposure to visualizations of academic performance on their SRL strategies and academic motivation. This study points to the importance of monitoring the effects of information presented via EWS on motivation and SRL.},

Using household survey data from thirteen low- and lower-middle-income countries, we find that missing or dropping out of school is associated with lower reading and numeracy outcomes. Drawing on global surveys conducted during the pandemic, we find that countries’ remote learning responses are often inadequate to keep all children learning, avoid dropout, and mitigate the learning losses our findings predict, particularly for marginalized children and those at the pre-primary level.},

 abstract = {Building on research from past decades, this paper explores cross-disciplinary curricular and teaching differences in online, blended and web-facilitated business and management courses. Based on an online survey of 240 USA, Canadian and European university instructors, the authors examine if faculty differ in their preferred course mode (the degree of online delivery), instructional tools used, and teaching methods, by discipline types (hard or soft) and five subject groups. The research found cross-disciplinary differences in the use of some of the 29 instructional tools surveyed (e.g. online group projects, group tools like wikis, and specialized software) and in teaching methods (didactic, dialectic dialogic, dialectic collaborative and heuristic). No significant disciplinary differences were found in the instructor's choice of course mode perhaps pointing to wider engagement in online learning in all business and management disciplines.},

 abstract = {Over the last few decades, there has been growing interest in artificial intelligence (AI) and how to apply it effectively in the educational process. The behavioural intention and attitudes of teachers play an important role in this regard. The technology acceptance model (TAM) has been shown to be effective in predicting factors that may positively or negatively influence behavioural intentions to use technology. The current study therefore aims to use this model to reveal teachers’ perceptions of the factors that influence the use of AI applications in science education. This research uses the descriptive method where a 6-dimensional scale is designed based on the components of the TAM model and then applied to a sample of 83 science teachers in Abu Dhabi. The results show a high acceptability of the use of AI in the classroom by science teachers, with positive correlations to self-efficacy, ease of use, expected benefits, attitudes, and behavioural intentions. However, anxiety and stress do not significantly affect other factors. Regarding the predictive power of research models, the combined factors expected benefits, ease of use, and attitude toward AI applications can predict 71.4% of future behavioural changes related to the use of AI applications in science teaching. This study finds no statistically significant differences in teacher responses based on the variables gender, teaching experience, and qualifications regarding teachers’ behavioural intentions to actually use AI in science teaching.},

 abstract = {The rapid expansion of Learning Analytics (LA) and Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED) offers new scalable, data-intensive systems but raises concerns about data privacy and agency. Excluding stakeholders—like students and teachers—from the design process can potentially lead to mistrust and inadequately aligned tools. Despite a shift towards human-centred design in recent LA and AIED research, there remain gaps in our understanding of the importance of human control, safety, reliability, and trustworthiness in the design and implementation of these systems. We conducted a systematic literature review to explore these concerns and gaps. We analysed 108 papers to provide insights about i) the current state of human-centred LA/AIED research; ii) the extent to which educational stakeholders have contributed to the design process of human-centred LA/AIED systems; iii) the current balance between human control and computer automation of such systems; and iv) the extent to which safety, reliability and trustworthiness have been considered in the literature. Results indicate some consideration of human control in LA/AIED system design, but limited end-user involvement in actual design. Based on these findings, we recommend: 1) carefully balancing stakeholders' involvement in designing and deploying LA/AIED systems throughout all design phases 2) actively involving target end-users, especially students, to delineate the balance between human control and automation, and 3) exploring safety, reliability, and trustworthiness as principles in future human-centred LA/AIED systems.},

 abstract = {E-learning sites are useful for improving the skills and awareness of the academic backbone, such as instructors, students, administrative staff, and those who are searching for current information about various educational institutes. Despite all the benefits of an online learning platform, users face some challenges and complexities, such as selecting appropriate learning material and courses based on their needs and preferences. Hence, the provision of quality resources during the training phases is their central responsibility, the lack of online assistance offered by service providers is known to be the key cause of many difficulties. There is a need to create a system that can intelligently propose courses while considering a variety of viewpoints to enhance the learners' skills and knowledge. This research proposes an architecture that builds semantic recommendations with the aid of virtual agents based on user requirements and preferences, assisting academia in seeking appropriate courses in a real-world setting. The experimental and statistical results show that, when compared with existing techniques, the virtualized agent-based recommendation system not only improved user learning skills but also made course selection easier, depending on users’ interests and preferences.},

 abstract = {The interaction between people and computers takes place everywhere in everyday life through information processing. As the degree of contact between humans and computers continues to increase, the cognitive burden of interaction between humans and computers increases as the operating errors rate increases. HCI scientists examine and create particular technology user interfaces. They research and enhance technology development processes and develop and assess new technological applications. HCI has gradually merged its scientific interests to improve the usability and the technical understanding and technique of computer systems. Artificial intelligence (HCI-AI) based problems in human-computer interactions are suggested to identify the relationship between cognitive knowledge and the comprehension of natural and artificial intelligence forms. The models describe the relationship between HCI research and the conception of interactions between humans and computers. A model of the planning and controlling numerous tasks at medical reception and their hypothesis illustrates the relationships defined thus. The proposal proposes to evaluate links between other studies and the design of human-make-computer interactions by using the relations described for HCI and cognitive science. The paper recommends that any discipline such as cognitive science, which has a relationship between its research and the design of the human-computer interactions, should perform this assessment. Such an evaluation would determine whether or not the relationship is specified. The article suggests that better relationships are necessary to provide more effective research support to develop interaction between humans and computers.},

 abstract = {Prediction of students’ academic performance has garnered considerable interest, with many institutions seek to enhance students’ performance and their quality of education. The integration of both unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques has demonstrated significant efficacy in predicting student performance. This paper explores the application of different machine learning methods in predicting student academic performance. Initially, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was utilised to reduce the dataset’s dimensionality, thereby improving its visualisation. Subsequently, K-Means clustering was employed to segregate students into distinct groups, reflective of their learning behaviors. Afterwards, the observed clusters were utilised for training classification models to address each student cluster individually. This approach was implemented in a case study involving an undergraduate science course at a North American University (NAU) and the Open University Learning Analytics Dataset (OULAD). Empirical findings indicate that the combined use of Feedforward Dense Network (FDN), Random Forest (RF), and Decision Tree (DT), specifically in their clustered forms, outperforms other classifiers in predicting student academic performance effectively.},

 abstract = {Although second language (L2) experts have advocated for multiliteracies pedagogies in language courses, little is known about how students experience learning with multiliteracies curricula. This article examines the perspectives of 185 undergraduate students enrolled in a fourth-semester French multiliteracies course at a university in the Southwestern United States. Through the theory and pedagogy of multiliteracies, this design-based implementation research investigates how students traversed multimodal composing in 376 video reflections and 265 digital multimodal projects. These data, along with interviews from 10 focal students, are analyzed qualitatively through multimodal transcription, open, axial, and selective coding to illuminate student perceptions. Findings demonstrate how the multimodal projects and the multiliteracies curricula provided students an avenue to develop critical literacy, a growth mindset, and a sense of community. Analysis additionally revealed that students perceived spontaneous speaking and time constraints as tensions in the multiliteracies curriculum. These findings hold implications for designing and scaffolding L2 multiliteracies courses throughout the scope and sequence of university language courses.},

 abstract = {This paper demonstrates a novel approach for a computer-based course assessment. A test is introduced in which computers are deployed. This significantly contributes to the enhancement of the marking consistency, individual performance distinction and feedbacks, and widen the questions range for computer-based modules. The proposed test method, for the first time, uses the simulation files marking for individualised evaluation purposes. The methodology has successfully been implemented in practice for three modules including Process Simulation (CE2105), Advanced Process Simulation (CE4023), and Process Computation (CE3021) at Aston University (UK) over three academic years, from 2016 to 2019. The effectiveness of the proposed approach has been evaluated using several factors, including final marks, consistency multiple academic years, and mark distribution. In contrast to the common teamwork assessments, individualised feedback became possible. While ASPEN has been used for CE4023 and CE2105 tests, MATLAB has been applied as the computation platform for CE3021 module. This reveals the applicability of different software in proposed methodology. The number of students in the cohorts studied was from 52 to 204, demonstrating the applicability of the method for various cohort sizes. Even though the methodology has been demonstrated based on the chemical engineering discipline modules, it allows digitalising the delivery and assessment of a wide range of simulation techniques in many disciplines.},

Many higher education institutions are shifting from an instructivist delivery (lectures) to a constructivist approach (workshops). In attempts to maximize the students' engagement, performance and learning outcomes, their readiness to learn also needs to be considered. This mixed-methods research paper investigates students’ perspectives of the impacts of a teaching and learning (T&L) transition in a project management program. Traditional delivery through lectures and tutorials, was replaced with flipped-blended learning through workshops. The study finds that the transition is generally well received. Engaged students are likely to perform well in a flipped workshop environment. However, scaffolding to prepare students for transition to flipped learning is key for driving knowledge gains, performance, engagement, collaboration and the overall positive learning experience.},

 abstract = {Hybrid learning strategies blend face-to-face instruction with online components, using Learning Management Systems (LMSs) as key platforms for educational resources. In strategies like the flipped classroom, students need to follow a specific learning pathway to complete certain activities in the LMS before class. This includes watching videos and completing readings and quizzes, to prepare for hands-on exercises during classroom time. Consistent student engagement with this approach is vital for success – but in large subjects with hundreds of enrolments, monitoring that engagement is a complex task. Using the data collected in an LMS, this paper presents an approach for detecting significant changes in student engagement in hybrid learning environments. The approach uses Process Mining (PM), a family of tools and techniques to analyze data through a process lens, to compare students' learning pathways between pairs of learning windows (e.g., weeks in a semester). Using a real-life event log containing more than 26,000 interactions of 194 students over a full semester, the findings demonstrate the approach's ability to detect changes in student engagement over time. These insights can be used by educators to refine their instructional design, deliver targeted interventions, and ultimately improve the overall effectiveness of hybrid learning.},

 abstract = {Given the focus on boosting retention rates and the potential benefits of proactive and early identification of students who may require support, higher education institutions are looking at the data already captured in university systems. Student early alert systems are part of formal, proactive, early intervention communication initiatives that institutions have put into place to help with the timely identification and intervention (alert) of at-risk students. The significance of student early alert systems is that support could be offered to high-risk students while they are still enrolled in the unit and able to influence their success/failure before the unit completes. Delivering timely interventions to students via a student early alert system typically requires teaching staff to identify at-risk students, and act upon that information in a way that would encourage students to change their behaviours. However, little is understood regarding teachers’ needs and attitudes towards the use of such a system. In the context of a prototype early alert system, this article reports the practices and opinions of a range of teaching staff across all faculties within an institution. The article sheds light on how teachers measure student performance and engagement in their units, and the perceived benefits and barriers of using the early alert system to identify and manage at-risk students.},

 abstract = {Academic failure is a persistent challenge in education. Despite the limited available data, in this study, we focus on identifying at-risk students in a blended learning (BL) course. Several motivational variables are analyzed to determine their effect on student performance. We use a machine-learning classifier to compare two approaches: 1) The benchmark study, which uses data from the same academic year for both training and testing; and 2) a prospective study, which focuses on extrapolating a model trained on the previous fall semester to predict outcomes for the upcoming fall semester. We categorize the motivational variables, including time management and event-occurrence frequency. The window-expansion strategy is adopted to enhance performance through periodic evaluation to facilitate timely intervention. Consequently, the prospective approach is consistent with the benchmark results, thus demonstrating its generalizability across academic years and student populations. This approach is promising for identifying at-risk students in the BL course early. The Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) method emphasizes the importance of time-management variables, particularly study in time, for identifying at-risk students. This study enhances our understanding of early detection methods for at-risk students. By analyzing time-related behaviors, we establish a robust foundation for data-driven decisions to improve future BL implementations as well as support motivation and self-regulated learning practices.},

 abstract = {Learning analytics has matured significantly since its early days. The field has rapidly grown in terms of the reputation of its publication venues, established a vibrant community, and has demonstrated an increasing impact on policy and practice. However, the boundaries of the field are still being explored by many researchers in a bid to determine what differentiates a contribution in learning analytics from contributions in related fields, which also center around data in education. In this paper, we propose that instead of emphasizing the examination of differences, a healthy development of the field should focus on collaboration and be informed by the developments in related fields. Specifically, the paper presents a framework for analysis how contemporary fields focused on the study of data in education influence trends in learning analytics. The framework is focused on the methodological paradigms that each of the fields is primarily based on – i.e., essentialist, entatitive/reductionst, ontological/dialectical, and existentialist. The paper uses the proposed framework to analyze how learning analytics (ontological) is being methodologically influenced by recent trends in the fields of educational data mining (entatitive), quantitative ethnography (existentialist), and learning at scale (essentialist). Based on the results of the analysis, this paper identifies gaps in the literature that warrant future research.},

 abstract = {A proposal for generating automated personalised formative feedback in chemical engineering coursework assignments by means of MS Excel is introduced and exemplified in this work. Underpinned by the assessment of material and energy balances, this tool processes the students’ answers using an algorithm able to generate and provide formative feedback based on personalised scores for each of the hundreds of variables that can be encountered in a material and energy balance for a realistic, system-level manufacturing process. These personalised values can then be used as a ‘stage-gate’ in the student understanding to attempt the more challenging components of the coursework before the final summative submission. Two different case studies (namely, acetone manufacturing and LNG processing) are presented in this article, with personalised feedback helping students to increase their marks by 23.3 and 6.8 absolute marks on average (out of 100), respectively, as compared to their original formative marks. The use of this efficient tool (ca. 1 -second processing time per individual student submission) can assist the students’ learning process as it promotes targeted engagement for developing their knowledge and skills; and it has the potential to become particularly valuable in engineering courses characterised by low staff to student ratios in which providing useful, personalised feedback with a quick turnaround becomes a gigantic challenge.},

In contrast to previous findings, our results reveal that student drop-out is not necessarily correlated with low motivation, as students may drop out despite being highly motivated at the end of their learning journey. To design more effective student retention campaigns, educational decision-makers must consider the motivation level and target potential drop-outs with a low state of motivation. More specifically, our findings emphasize the need for early intervention to prevent students from dropping out, as it becomes challenging to stimulate motivation once it reaches its lowest state. By adopting our proposed methodology, decision-makers can gain a better understanding of the student drop-out process and make more informed student retention interventions.},

Although prior studies have generated single point estimates to quantify predictive efficacy, much less education research has examined variability in student performance predictions using nonparametric bootstrap algorithms in data pipelines. In this study, bootstrapping was applied to examine performance variability among five data mining methods (DMMs) and four filter preprocessing feature selection techniques for forecasting course grades for 3225 students enrolled in an undergraduate biology class. While the median area under the curve (AUC) values obtained from bootstrapping were significantly lower than the AUC point estimates obtained without resampling, DMMs and feature selection techniques impacted variability in different ways. The ensemble technique elastic net regression (GLMNET) significantly outperformed all other DMMs and exhibited the least amount of variability in the AUC. However, all filter feature selection techniques significantly increased variability in student success predictions, compared to when this step was omitted from the data pipeline. We discuss the potential benefits and drawbacks of incorporating bootstrapping into prediction pipelines to track, monitor, and forecast classroom performance, as well as highlight the risks of only examining point estimates.},

 abstract = {Following the COVID-19 lockdown around the world, including in Mauritius, higher education has temporarily shifted to online education through e-learning platforms for students to supplement their learning. During this time, most activities had to be adjusted to ensure that students were not penalized in their learning. Unlike formal supervised exams, online assessments were undertaken pending the return of formal exams after the pandemic. As a consequence, e-learning has been eye-opening in that it has fostered an open assessment system with new modes of assessment. The immediate question that arose was whether academic integrity was indeed embraced or not. In the new learning paradigm, all forms of assessment seemed less formalized. Dissertations, group assignments, coursework, and individual assignments as well as online exams had to be examined to ensure that each component of teaching evaluation should be linked to assurance quality in order to maintain the quality of teaching and learning. A survey by questionnaire was carried out among a hundred students from the Université des Mascareignes in Mauritius. The main conclusions indicated that each form of assessment should have its own quality assurance framework adapted while allowing a variety of assessments in the new learning system henceforth favored by the institution. Far from being skeptical about the effectiveness of open learning systems, it was seen that such a mechanism had significance in terms of quality assurance provided that the key levers are duly applied and respected.},

 abstract = {The traditional “one size fits all” education system has been largely criticized in recent years on the ground of its lacking the capacity to meet individual student needs. Global education systems are leaning towards a more personalized, student-centered approach. Innovations like Big Data, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have given the modern-day technology to accommodate the distinctive features of human beings - smart machines and computers have been built to understand individual-specific needs. This opens an avenue for “personalization” in the education sector. From, mushrooming of Education Technology (EdTech) start-ups to government funding in AI research, it is evident that the next generation educational reforms would take a quantum leap forward piloted by Big Data analysis and AI. The objective of this paper is to organize the vast literature on the use of AI for personalization of education and to shed light on the key themes by which an AI-driven approach makes structural modifications to the existing education system. To this effect, the paper employed a systematic review using a Human-In-The-Loop natural language processing model of past two years' literature (2019–2021) in English language from IEEE Xplore on countries China, India and the USA. This process yielded more than 2000 search results at first and these were eventually shortlisted to 353 relevant papers for in-depth analysis. Being the pioneers in EdTech innovations, insights from research done in these three countries provides valuable input for the development of global education systems and research. The findings bring forward AI's success in catering to specific learning requirements, learning habits, and learning abilities of students and guiding them into optimized learning paths across all three countries. Not just that, it is also evident from the literature that AI augments educational content, customizes it for any individual according to their needs, and raises the flag of caution for anticipated learning difficulties. This recalibrates the role of instructors as well as optimizes the teaching-learning environment for a better learning experience. The upward trajectory of educational development with AI opens a new horizon of personalized education for the future generation, but also comes with its challenges. Data privacy issues, availability of digital resources, and affordability constraints have been reported in the recent literature as impediments in the way of promoting such technologies for day-to-day practice.},

 abstract = {While researchers promote the interactive learning potential of digital tools, studies reveal that teachers adapt technology to existing practice instead of using the tools' potential for student active learning. Researchers also argue that formative assessment enhances students' learning, while studies find formative assessment difficult to implement. To investigate these paradoxes and better understand how teachers use digital tools in formative assessment and with what result, we conducted a systematic review of teachers' technology use in formative assessment practices in primary and secondary education. Systematic searches identified 22 relevant articles that are included in the review. We found unclear definitions of formative assessment across studies and document challenges teachers encounter when they use technology for formative assessment purposes. We conclude with three prerequisites for teachers' successful technology use in formative assessment practices: 1) clear definitions of formative assessment, 2) alignment between digital tools and pedagogical practice, and 3) data literacy to examine and interpret information and use this to improve students’ learning. The review also documents knowledge gaps in current research.},

Ninety-six blended and 85 online learners completed a formative assessment task, received feedback, and then resubmit the assessment for a summative grade. Overall, while there were differences between learning contexts, SRL, and performance, many variables were not significant predictors of performance. Online learners who were confident, managed their time well and regulated their efforts saw the greatest benefits, though these effects were small when viewed individually. Blended learners, to a lesser extent, also benefited from confidence and effort regulation.

 abstract = {Feedback is an essential component of scaffolding for learning. Feedback provides insights into the assistance of learners in terms of achieving learning goals and improving self-regulated skills. In online courses, feedback becomes even more critical since instructors and students are separated geographically and physically. In this context, feedback allows the instructor to customize learning content according to the students' needs. However, giving feedback is a challenging task for instructors, especially in contexts of large cohorts. As a result, several automatic feedback systems have been proposed to reduce the workload on the part of the instructor. Although these systems have started gaining research attention, there have been limited studies that systematically analyze the progress achieved so far as reported in the literature. Thus, this article presents a systematic literature review on automatic feedback generation in learning management systems. The main findings of this review are: (1) 65.07% of the studies demonstrate that automatic feedback increases student performance in activities; (2) 46.03% of the studies demonstrated that there is no evidence that automatic feedback eases instructors’ workload; (3) 82.53% of the studies showed that there is no evidence that manual feedback is more efficient than automatic feedback; and (4) the main method used for automatic feedback provision is the comparison with a desired answer in some subject (such as logic circuits or programming).},

Many researchers interested in these areas may wonder why there are two different communities, whether they are the same concept or not, and the differences between them, which is key information for designing their research and publication strategies. To address this, we conducted a systematic review of academic papers about the differences between LA and EDM following the Preferred Reporting Method for Systematic Reviews (PRISMA) guidelines. We selected 10 research works and identified 11 differences. Our conclusions are that, although both use the same data and share similar goals and interests, EDM and LA are different research communities with different origins and focuses, with their respective conferences and journals. However, there is active collaboration between the two communities and their members often tend to publish in both fields’ conferences and journals. Additionally, none of the differences are apparently large enough to conclude that LA and EDM follow different paths for improving the teaching-learning process, but rather the opposite. Following a common future line, it seems that the two “sister” communities are working together with the same perspective, along with some “cousin” communities such as AIED (Artificial Intelligence in Education), L@S (Learning at Scale), Learning Science (LS), etc. in the same area that could be called Educational Data Science (EDS).

In AI-mediated language learning, the technology's metacognitive importance enables students to learn with AI as a partner, encouraging independent critical thinking. Within Zimmerman's SRL model, AI as a mind tool is integrated for improving language students' strategic employment in a cyclical process. A systematic review, following PRISMA protocols, examines the intersection of AI and self-regulated language learning (SRLL) over 2000–2022. Findings highlight AI's evolving role, predominantly through algorithms and systems, aiming for micro and macro integration. Interactive AI has not fully engaged in two-way directions, despite a familiar process approach in reviewed studies. In the favored ESL/EFL research context, task-specific AI is utilized to encourage cyclical improvement with learner autonomy enhancement mainly among higher education students at intermediate level or above. Pedagogical values are possible when major SRL phases are fully practiced, even without highly autonomous AI. Future research is directed toward adaptive personalized technology by exploring the dynamic interplay between AI technologies and SRLL as educational practices under Education 4.0 principles.},

Results showed that when ICT-integrated mathematics remedial instruction was not implemented, students' scores in the posttest were not significantly higher; however, after implementing ICT-integrated mathematics remedial instruction, the grades in the posttest were significantly higher. Regarding students' intention to use ICT-integrated mathematics remedial instruction, the research model was developed from the technology acceptance model. This study analyzed data collected from questionnaires using the partial-least-squares structural equation modeling multivariate data analysis method. The results indicated that (1) perceived usefulness significantly affected attitude toward use and behavioral intention to use; (2) attitude toward use significantly affected behavioral intention to use; and (3) attitude toward use exhibited significant mediating effects between perceived usefulness and behavioral intention to use, indicating that perceived usefulness primarily affected students’ behavioral intention to use through attitude toward use. The results may facilitate the application of technology to implement mathematics remedial instruction.},

 abstract = {This research explored the typologies of self-regulated learners in an asynchronous online Chemistry I (OCI) course of an undergraduate active learning program. Student readiness and capability regarding self-regulated learning (SRL), the activity logs in the learning management system, and academic achievement were collected to investigate behavioral sequences of different typologies of learning self-regulation. Seventeen students who took OCI in the 2019 school year were recruited for the study. Through learning analytics for the 3965 behavioral codes, the study generated three key results. First, hierarchical cluster analysis classified two typologies of self-regulated online learners: High self-regulated learners (H-SRLs) and low self-regulated learners (L-SRLs). Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test further revealed a higher academic achievement in H-SRLs than that of the L-SRLs. Second, lag sequential analysis portrayed different behavioral sequences in the performance control phrase of SRL. H-SRLs tended to leverage proper learning skills like practice immediately after receiving assistance whereas L-SRLs exit immediately without taking further actions after learning new materials, revisited the syllabus, and checked course grades. Qualitative interviews further confirmed the relationship between different strategies used in the phase and the academic performance. L-SRLs were more likely to adopt passive learning strategies and even mismatched goals and strategies during online learning, while H-SRLs appeared otherwise. To support successful online learning experiences, the researchers suggest integrating workshops and resources into the online learning orientation that focus on the performance control of SRL. Moreover, AIED platform features also may support L-SRLs in performing proper learning strategies.},

Guided by Winne and Hadwin's COPES model (1998), SRL was operationalized at a coarse level with students' online log data and course assessment scores representing their SRL operations and products of SRL in the course, respectively. Results of mixed ANOVAs and chi-square tests of independence showed that the LA-based feedback enhanced students' completion rate of online learning activities and their study regularity. The treatment group exhibited superior performance in the final examination compared to the comparison group, providing evidence of the positive impact of LA-based feedback on students' course performance. The study represents an initial effort to utilize LA-based feedback to support students' SRL operations and course performance in an EFL context.},

Yet few studies have explored the effect of learning and assessment tasks on the engagement and performance of Chinese students who are undergoing a transition into the Western learning environment. We design two online review exercises, which are summative assessments with a formative aspect, for an introductory financial accounting subject and study the effect of these tasks on a group of business students enrolled in the course at an international joint venture university based in China. We find that the online review exercises increase student engagement. Students spent a significant amount of time preparing for the online review exercises both before making their initial attempt and between each attempt. Students undertook a variety of learning activities in completing the online review exercises and their understanding of the subject improved as a result of going through the process. Student performance in the midterm and final exams is positively related to their efforts in completing the online review exercises. The findings are of relevance to accounting educators in both the Western HEIs and traditional Chinese universities who are interested in enhancing the learning performance of Chinese business students.},

The purpose of this study was to examine the relations between academic delay, motivational beliefs, and academic achievement in an online science course. The sample included one hundred and sixty-eight undergraduate students. Leveraging learning analytics and using multilevel modeling, this study found that academic delay was composed of habitual and momentary components. Controlling for motivational beliefs, habitual delay was significantly more negative than momentary delay in relation to academic achievement. The relation between academic delay and academic achievement was moderated by motivational beliefs. The negative effect of momentary delay on academic achievement was dependent on academic self-efficacy, while the negative effect of habitual delay on academic achievement was dependent on emotional cost. These findings further confirm that academic delay in online learning environments is not necessarily harmful for college students. Simply focusing on academic delay without considering who is engaging in such behavior could be misleading for future intervention.},

 abstract = {The development of creativity is a major challenge for engineering education. Creativity not only affects originality and innovation but also increases the utility of products and ideas, thus yielding a competitive advantage in the market. Although studies have demonstrated that creativity can be practically assessed through student innovation or responses to creativity questionnaires, few studies have explored how creativity is developed. Therefore, this study developed a model for predicting creativity based on the discussion records of students during creative activities. The model was designed using the Chinese Knowledge Information Processing tokenization system, a term frequency–inverse document frequency method, and support vector machines. The experimental results revealed a model accuracy of 93 %, thus demonstrating the model’s feasibility for predicting creativity. Furthermore, the students’ key terms were obtained by using k-means clustering with the proposed model, thus yielding valuable supplementary information for exploring the development of creative ideas. These results revealed that data mining has substantial value in creativity education. Therefore, the proposed predictive model is suitable for predicting creativity in learning activities based on discussion records. It can support teachers’ assessment of student performance and provision of timely guidance and feedback to enhance creative thinking and stimulate imagination among engineering students.},

Group and individual learning were assessed weekly by evaluating the completeness of collaborative note-taking documents and subsequent individual assessments. Analysis suggested up to 23% of the variation in course performance could be attributed to between-group effects. Further, a series of 10 multilevel temporal models suggested no substantive effects in the first half of the course, though in the second half of the course, groups that co-created more complete course notes tended to exhibit improved average student performance. We speculate that the learning advantages afforded to student groups that produce more complete course notes may be delayed.

 abstract = {Online learning has been adopted rapidly by educational institutions and organizations. Despite its many advantages, including 24/7 access, high flexibility, rich content, and low cost, online learning suffers from high dropout rates that hamper pedagogical and economic goal outcomes. Enhanced student dropout prediction tools would help providers proactively detect students at risk of leaving and identify factors that they might address to help students continue their learning experience. Therefore, this study seeks to improve student dropout predictions, with three main contributions. First, it benchmarks a recently proposed logit leaf model (LLM) algorithm against eight other algorithms, using a real-life data set of 10,554 students of a global subscription-based online learning provider. The LLM outperforms all other methods in finding a balance between predictive performance and comprehensibility. Second, a new multilevel informative visualization of the LLM adds novel benefits, relative to a standard LLM visualization. Third, this research specifies the impacts of student demographics; classroom characteristics; and academic, cognitive, and behavioral engagement variables on student dropout. In reviewing LLM segments, these results show that different insights emerge for various student segments with different learning patterns. This notable result can be used to personalize student retention campaigns.},

Therefore, our study explored the ability of two versions of GPT models – i.e., GPT-3.5 (ChatGPT) and GPT-4 – to generate assessment feedback on students' writing assessment tasks, common in higher education, with open-ended topics for a data science-related course. We compared the feedback generated by GPT models (namely GPT-3.5 and GPT-4) with the feedback provided by human instructors in terms of readability, effectiveness (content containing effective feedback components), and reliability (correct assessment on student performance). Results showed that (1) both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 were able to generate more readable feedback with greater consistency than human instructors, (2) GPT-4 outperformed GPT-3.5 and human instructors in providing feedback containing information about effective feedback dimensions, including feeding-up, feeding-forward, process level, and self-regulation level, and (3) GPT-4 demonstrated higher reliability of feedback compared to GPT-3.5. Based on our findings, we discussed the potential opportunities and challenges of utilising GPT models in assessment feedback generation.},

 abstract = {Teacher feedback provided to learners in real-time is a crucial factor for their knowledge and skills acquisition. However, providing real-time feedback at an individual level is often infeasible, considering limited teaching resources. Fortunately, recent technological advancements have allowed for developing of various computer tutoring systems, which can support learners at any place and time by generating personalized feedback automatically. Such systems have emerged in various domains, tackle different educational tasks, and often are designed in very distinctive ways. Consequently, the knowledge in the field of automated feedback systems is rather scattered across different domains and applications, as we illustrate in this study. This paper aims to outline the state-of-the-art of recently developed systems for delivering automated feedback, and thus serves as a source of systematic information for educators, researchers in the educational domain and system developers. More specifically, the contribution of this study is twofold. Firstly, we offer an extensive literature review of the field. As a result of a rigorous selection process, consisting of 4 phases, a total of 109 automated feedback systems is selected for a detailed review and thoroughly classified against numerous dimensions. Secondly, based on a detailed analysis of the recent literature sources and following the design science research approach, a classification framework for automated feedback systems is developed. This framework is used to classify the selected systems, and thus give a detailed overview of the predominantly available educational technologies, the educational settings in which they are applied, the properties of automated feedback they deliver, and the approaches for their design and evaluation. Based on this analysis, several important observations and recommendations are put forward as an outcome of the study. In particular, our study outlines the current fragmentation of the field, discusses a need for a common reference framework, and calls for more personalized, data-driven and student-centered solutions to exploit a larger set of opportunities offered in this age of data.},

Student behaviour and performance were monitored via the Learning Management System (LMS) used in all courses. This paper presents an analysis of various metrics from the LMS and demonstrates a high level of engagement of the students committed to the courses and a high success rate for those students.

 abstract = {An approach to adding concurrency to an existing undergraduate course should integrate driving problems used in analogies, worked examples, and assignments; amplify the subject/topics of the existing course; and ensure that the addition does not have a negative impact on (a) conceptual focus, and (b) student learning, struggle, and engagement. When concurrency is added to a course covering object-based programming, five related design principles for meeting these, sometimes conflicting, requirements are: (a) analogies, worked examples, and assignments are all implementations of simulations of moving physical objects, (b) the user-interface components of the simulations are created automatically or implemented manually using the MVC design pattern, (c) assignment implementations are layered to follow the logical dependence among concepts, (d) the concurrency aspects of the functional components of the simulations are implemented using reusable loop and design patterns, and (e) students can experiment with concurrency extensions to implementations of worked examples and assignments. We followed these principles in multiple course offerings that added concurrency to two different courses on object-based programming. Our data-based evaluation of these offerings, using new inferencing algorithms, analyzed the number of posts and contributions to class discussion forums; the number of entries in class participation diaries; the number of times an automated test is run before it passes; and the percentage of attempts to implement different aspects of concurrency that yield no success. The results show that adding thread execution and creation, synchronization, and coordination has little or no significant effect on measures of engagement, learning, and struggle.},

 abstract = {University courses often employ “one-size-fits-all” approaches, disregarding the heterogeneity in students' cognitive and motivational characteristics. This intervention study reports on an individualized learning design for online teaching in higher education. In a randomized field experiment with N = 438 university students (57% female, mean age M = 20.96 years), we investigated the effects of the learning design on students' motivation (self-concept, self-efficacy, intrinsic and utility task values), on their performance, and, because our sample consisted of teacher students, on their professional development with regard to inclusive education. Employing structural equation modeling, we found that the intervention positively affected the self-concepts of effort avoidant students. The intervention also positively impacted students' attitudes and self-efficacy towards inclusive education, but had no effect on course performance, course-related self-efficacy and task values. Moreover, learning analytics data revealed in-depth information on students’ learning behavior. Results are discussed regarding possible intervention strategies to be implemented in future versions of the learning design.},

We detail what we know about how to increase student turnout, suggest ways to strengthen voter mobilization efforts through a broader civic education agenda, chart a path forward for future research, and offer recommendations for college administrators who seek to make voting a lifelong habit for their students. We also look beyond the student voting movement to argue for new forms of pedagogy that foster civic identity so that students think of themselves as voters who always vote, because voting is a necessary way to express themselves as engaged citizens.},

 abstract = {This paper introduces the concept of infrastructure into discussions on climate change and education. We focus on the links between the increased use of digital data and the central role of data infrastructures in education, and the energy infrastructure needed to support their growing use in schools and school systems. We elaborate a need for a greater accounting of the climate and related social costs of these interwoven digital and energy infrastructures of schooling. We suggest this is part of the ‘disposition’ of the infrastructures of schooling that should be weighed into decisions on whether and how to continue with digital technologies in schools. By acknowledging the climate and environmental incommensurability of digital infrastructures, education leaders and young people can more fully understand their dispositions and their costs. We propose three implications for education governance that entail greater consideration of the limits of current school climate change infrastructures such as ‘eco school’ programs and EdTech ‘AI for good’ initiatives, pushes for ‘computing within limits’ without substantial changes, and current school governance practices which unnecessarily rely on digital infrastructures. Instead, what is needed may be a reversal of the extensive use of digital infrastructures by schools and education governance bodies.},

A learner’s performance can be defined as how well students are learning in terms of knowledge and skills development and can be analyzed based on students’ outcomes and engagement in the course. We have consolidated the work carried out from 2011 to 2022 to improve learners’ performance using LA, describe criteria that define learners’ performance, discuss parameters that impact learners’ performance, and how predictive models can be created to forecast learners’ performance using these parameters. Results showed that the data collected from log files of the Learning Management System (LMS) had been used to get insights into the learner’s performance in online platforms and LA could bring incredible benefits in the field of the education sector, such as improvement of learners’ involvement with learning activities as well as learning outcomes, identification of students at risk, providing real-time feedback, and personalization of learning. Hence, we can say usage of LA significantly helps learners’ performance improvement in learning portals. But we can get better results if we augment data from log files of LMS with the learner’s personal data from his birth to the current moment, which is a bit challenging with respect to data collection i.e., huge and from multiple sources.},

 abstract = {Objective: This study examined the effects of offering proactive student-success coaching, informed by predictive analytics, on student academic performance and persistence. Specifically, this study investigated semester grade point average (GPA) and semester-to-semester persistence of community college students as outcomes. Methods: This study involved two stages of analysis. First, we used inverse probability of treatment weighting to create appropriately balanced samples of the students offered proactive assistance and students not offered proactive assistance to approximate a randomized control trial with observational data. Then, we applied regression analyses with weights and covariates to the balanced samples to estimate outcomes. Results: Using regression analyses with weights and covariates, we estimated few statistically significant results in sample subgroup models and no statistically significant results for whole-group samples. Generally, our analyses found that the offer of the intervention had no effect on students’ persistence and semester GPAs. Conclusions/Contributions: This study contributes empirical results to the emerging literature regarding student-success coaching, predictive analytics, and student-monitoring systems. The results demonstrate the necessity of performing rigorous analyses on these predictive-analytic systems and reveals ethical concerns that should be considered in designing interventions.},

 abstract = {During various learning activities, teachers and students need to clarify, explore and share their understanding of reading materials. For doing this, they must make explicit the mental representation constructed during the reading process. In this article, we propose an approach combining semantic annotations and semantic networks as formal means for elicitation, structuring, formalisation, analysis and sharing of teachers’ and students’ understanding of textual materials that they are asked to read in learning tasks. In the proposed approach, teachers can create learning tasks, in which students are asked to semantically annotate a text by associating portions of it to resources described in a Knowledge Base (KB) in accordance with a provided ontology. New instances can be created by students or teachers in the KB during the annotation process. We show how semantic networks can be used to visualise extracts of the resulting KB, and to help people organise their comprehension of texts. In addition, teachers can assess student evolution by analysing the semantic networks that each one produces during the reading and annotation process. This approach is implemented by using our annotation tool, integrated with a digital repository and a virtual learning environment. An empirical evaluation of the benefits of the proposed approach in a literature case study confirms that it facilitates information extraction, sharing and analysis, contributing to leverage teaching and learning.},

These results highlight the potential of data-driven techniques in informing educational stakeholders’ decision-making processes, enabling targeted interventions, and facilitating personalized learning strategies tailored to students’ needs. By identifying at-risk students early in the academic year, institutions can provide additional support to improve academic outcomes and retention rates. The study also discusses practical implications, including the development of pedagogical policies and guidelines based on early predictions, which can help educational institutions maintain strong academic outcomes and enhance their reputation for academic excellence.

Convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are specific types of these networks, are used effectively for complex problems such as image processing, computer vision and speech recognition. In this study, a student model was created using a CNN due to the complexity of the learning process, and the performance of the model was examined. The student modeling technique used was named LearnerPrints. The navigation data of the students in a learning management system were used to construct the model. Training and test data were used to analyze the performance of the model. The classification results showed that CNNs can be used effectively for student modeling. The modeling was based on the students’ achievement and used the students’ data from the learning management system.

 abstract = {A problem-based immersive virtual environment (IVE) about bushfire safety was developed as a learning tool for children aged 10–12. Its effectiveness was assessed in relation to children’s ability to determine how to be safer in a bushfire incident. A series of experiential activities were developed in the IVE with digital storytelling and two-stage embedded assessments providing children with an opportunity to engage with tasks and solve problems while receiving feedback on their performance. Changes from pre- to postsurvey results showed positive learning outcomes as evidenced by significant improvements in children’s knowledge of bushfire safety and confidence in their ability to contribute to decisions during a bushfire incident. The significant change in children’s knowledge as well as their performance at two-stage embedded assessments was independent of their gender, background knowledge and perceived ability in responding to bushfire hazards. This suggests that when appropriately designed and implemented within educational settings, immersive virtual learning tools can effectively engage children and enhance learning outcomes associated with bushfire safety. The paper also argues that such immersive problem-based learning can improve self-efficacy amongst children in relation to coping with a bushfire situation. Implications of the findings are also discussed.},

After that, based on the overall research content of the reviewed literature, a framework for learning analytics based on wearable devices is present, and its application process is summarized and analyzed for the reference of related researchers. At last, we summarize the limitations of existing studies and present several recommendations to further promote research and development in this field.},

 abstract = {Serious games are considered an effective method to engage students in programming education and have been increasingly used in classrooms. An important part of the learning process with serious games involves the presentation of the new concepts and the provided support to encounter student difficulties. Although the most common approach is the use of instructional text, it comes with some drawbacks. This paper proposes an alternative method for user support in serious games about programming which mitigates current problems and provides improved learning efficiency. An experiment was conducted (N = 291) to test textual instructions learning efficiency compared to in-game worked examples. Two randomly assigned groups used different types of support in a block-based game, developed for the study. Our implementation provided support through a non-player character who executed worked examples inside the game world. The analysis showed a significant statistical difference in score performance between the two supports on both novice and experienced students. The results point to increased learning efficiency by students, when in-game worked examples and problem-solving are combined. We further argue that the Cognitive load theory can provide adequate justification for the outcomes.},

 abstract = {Online learning communities are becoming increasingly popular as they are known to support collaborative dialogue and knowledge building. Previous studies have typically focused on small, closed learning communities from an individual, static, and aggregated perspective. This research aims to advance our understanding of open and large online learning networks by exploring and characterizing community level dynamics and communities of performance. To achieve this goal, we mined a large open online learning network of over 30,000 students and approximately one million posts. First, we analyzed overall community network development by building temporal social networks. Subsequently, we studied sub-community dynamics using community detection algorithms, and, following that, investigated the interaction between community dynamics and communities of performance using best colleague correlation and Kruskal-Wallis test. Results found that large open online learning communities begin with a very large network having numerous small sub-communities. These communities consist of students who are similar in performance with strong links. The overall network size gradually shrinks, as does the number of sub-communities, and these communities evolve over time for their membership formulation with students who are more different in performance with weaker ties. Theoretical, practical, and methodological implications are then discussed. This study pushed the online learning community research to examine large and open networks by taking a more community-based and dynamic view of investigation.},

However, the fit of game mechanisms is still uncertain. Thus, this study investigates the effect of achieving fit when implementing game mechanisms on learning outcomes by applying the well-known task-technology fit theory (TTF). TTF is frequently employed to improve fit between tasks to be completed and the technology applied. The findings indicate that achieving gamification fit can reduce the cognitive load of students and result in enhanced learning performance in terms of learning outcomes. Data collected from 266 participants were analyzed using the technique of the partial least squares to validate the developed research model. The findings of this study can aid educators and educational technology designers in identifying the design mechanisms and characteristics that can be used to ensure design fit on gamification platforms.},

This study investigates the relationship between psychology students’ perceived diversity climate and their learning outcomes in a gender-mixed computer-supported collaborative learning (CSCL) course in introductory psychology. Our main hypotheses were that the diversity climate—learning outcome relationships would be stronger for male (gender minority) than for female students (gender majority). Methods: This study used data from a large sample of university first-year students at a blended learning university (n = 1,172, 75% female) with three points of measurement in a 9-week CSCL assignment. Findings: Moderated-mediation regression analyses confirmed that students’ perceptions of the diversity climate in their CSCL group were significantly related to gains in online learning self-efficacy among male, but not female students. Furthermore, by increasing gains in self-efficacy, climate perceptions also translated into better quiz performance among male students. Contributions: This study shows that for men perceived diversity climate is a significant determinant of their individual learning outcomes. This calls for paying more attention to the minority perspectives of males in female-dominated psychological programs to better understand why this is the cas.},

 abstract = {When considering digital futures for universities it is the instrumentalising narratives developed by corporate ‘ed-tech’ which often drive the debate. These are narratives which, aligning tightly to marketisation, unbundling and other dominant ideological trends, describe a highly technologised, datafied and surveillant future for teaching. This future is often framed as an imperative, leaving university communities with the sense that a future is being designed for them over which they have relatively little control. This paper describes the theory, methods and outcomes of a project which set out to counter this tendency, using participative, co-design methods within a ‘top down’ policy initiative to envision an alternative future for digital education within our own institution. Our starting point was that universities need to get better at crafting their own, compelling counter-narratives concerning the future of technology in teaching, in order to assert the agency and presence of the academic and student bodies in the face of technological change. In working toward this, we drew on recent thinking in anticipation studies in education and developed an original methodology for participative futures work within universities. The paper reports on the outcomes of this project, and its implications for the sector more generally, arguing that university communities can work to define their own digital futures through an emphasis on collectivity, participation and hope.},

 abstract = {The study aimed to investigate the relationship between content, teaching, and LMS platform, and student achievement in online classes. To accomplish this, the study drew upon the transactional distance theory and the community of inquiry framework. Using log data from the LMS platform, the study analyzed the impact of student-faculty interaction, student-content interaction, and student-systems interaction on learning outcomes. The sample consisted of online classes offered in the Department of International Marketing at B University in Korea during the spring semester of 2022. The study specifically targeted classes with 40 or more students to ensure an adequate sample size. The researchers used parallelism tests to confirm the validity of the research model, followed by a goodness of fit test with an ordinal Logit model. The results indicated that all three factors of interaction (content, teaching, and platform) had a significant positive effect on learning outcomes, while student-Zoom interaction did not. The interaction between learners and content was found to be the most important predictor of learning achievement, suggesting that student engagement with course materials plays a crucial role in their academic success. The study’s findings have important implications for educators who are interested in improving online teaching and learning. The study recommends expanding the empirical analysis of the research model from the existing structural equation or multiple regression model to the ordinal logit model to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the impact of these factors on student achievement. Overall, the study highlights the importance of considering the complex interaction between content, teaching, and platform in designing and delivering effective online courses that promote student engagement and achievement.},

 abstract = {Social Media (SM)’s use as pedagogical tools in Higher Education (HE) institutions is gaining robust momentum among researchers from different disciplines. While most universities implemented Learning Management Systems (Blackboard Learn, Moodle, etc.) as essential instruments in their teaching and learning(T&L) methods, the adoption of SM platforms such as Facebook, YouTube, etc., as in-class educational and communication tools is still in its infancy. Despite the numerous available studies on SM’s adoption as T&L instruments in HE, little has been made to develop a standard framework for SM’s integration as effective educational tool in classroom environments. This paper followed a thematic review of 19 relevant studies to analyse and identify common practices and findings on SM’s inclusion as T&L tools in HE. Subsequently, the findings formed the basis in developing a conceptual framework for SM’s integration as pedagogical tools in HE classrooms. This framework introduces SM’s adoption process as a formal educational tool, the development of SM implementation processes, and assists in understanding the influence of SM on education environments. The research outlines major findings in current literature, thereby, providing valuable insights on SM’s use in education, besides forming the basis for future quantitative and qualitative researches in this area of study.},

 abstract = {Digital technology in education has become a staple of many contemporary classrooms. Educational technology offers many benefits, including access to knowledge, mobility, multiple means of engagement, accessibility, distance learning, as well as the ability to connect in unprecedented ways. There is a growing body of research that examines digital learning tools, online classroom environments, learning management systems and other technologies that are integrated into the learning process. Such research extends to analysing the positive impacts of online and blended learning; however, few studies explore the user preferences of the learners. Without assessment of the user preference, the benefits of learning through technology are often lessened. This research explores and analyses how user media preferences influence engagement and motivation in online learning. One hundred twenty-two KS3 (13-year-olds) secondary school were provided voluntary access to a purpose-built online learning resource that augmented their in-class Holocaust history curriculum with learning materials in audio, video and e-text. Data were collected through web analytics and user feedback forms. The analytical tools provided detailed quantitative data on user activity on the site, while the feedback forms yielded qualitative data on usefulness and enjoyment. Results provided insights on the usage trends and user preferences that influence engagement. These behavioural patterns reflect user motivation and learning preferences and can be utilised to personalise digital content delivery to increase engagement with online learning material.},

 abstract = {With the recent COVID-19 pandemic and disruption of campus-based education, the use of mobile social networking applications to supplement formal education has attracted a great deal of attention. Teachers do have opportunities to join students’ online groups to share, clarify, and exchange housekeeping information and course-related content with them. Teachers can, in particular, provide English as a foreign language (EFL) students with more sources of linguistic input, interaction, and feedback. Research investigating this potential, however, is still scarce in such contexts. The current study explores the likely affordances of teaching presence in students’ WhatsApp groups for designing, facilitating, and guiding cognitive and social processes conducive to their language learning. A mixed-method design was employed to collect both quantitative and qualitative data and information from English-major undergraduates (N = 111) and faculty teachers (N = 8) who joined the same WhatsApp groups for one academic semester at a major university in Oman. Descriptive and thematic analyses of data from a survey with both closed-ended and open-ended questions and semi-structured interviews indicate that the shared WhatsApp groups functioned as small close-knit communities where students were able to constantly access teachers for their assistance, feedback, and clarification of content. Despite these merits, however, the participating faculty believed that the presence of teachers in WhatsApp groups might have consequences for students’ tolerance of ambiguity, scaffolding, and autonomous language learning. The paper concludes by discussing several pedagogical implications and directions for future research.},

 abstract = {Many institutions of higher education systems worldwide are transitioning from face-to-face modality to e-learning as a means of solving issues of limited resources and access to quality education. One of the crucial prerequisites for the successful implementation of e-learning is a careful consideration of emerging technologies and the underlying pedagogy of how learning takes place using a virtual platform. In practice, however, this consideration is often a neglected aspect in developing countries’ context, and this neglect results in several challenges in academic setups. This study identifies and evaluates clusters of e-learning features and implementation strategies in use and challenges sought at the ET Online College located in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. The features of these strategies are briefly discussed, as well as how these strategies evolved during the implementation processes. The college’s e-learning components have achieved merits for quality by their primary users (online students, e-course instructors, and technology, instructional design, and curriculum experts), web designers and graphic designers, and administrators within the college. These also achieved acceptance nationally by the larger key stakeholders. The findings and recommendations of the study can be used as empirical evidence-base to help policymakers strategically think about the implementation of e-learning in the Ethiopian Higher Education institutions, and other similar contexts at large.},

 abstract = {Smart learning environment (SLE) modules are rapidly expanding with the advancement of technology. However, the concept is still new to many educational institutions in developing countries, with scant studies conducted using the African context. To avoid being left behind in the steps towards modernization, the qualitative study proposes the need to migrate from a traditional learning environment (TLE) to a SLE. Thirty-eight (38) teachers in Ghana who transitioned from TLE to a SLE were recruited to explore their pedagogical experiences in instructing in TLE (old classrooms) and SLE (new classrooms). Generally, teachers favoured SLE compared to TLE. Teachers were motivated to instruct in smart schools because of the affordances of smart technologies. They considered the ambience created in SLE as conducive to promoting their psychological well-being, facilitating their professional development, fostering good assessment strategies, and building twenty-first-century skills in learners needed in the labour market. However, a majority of the teachers perceived self-regulation and social interactions to be more effective in TLE. The key challenges in the SLE included network lag, limited funds to purchase data bundles, malfunction of learning management systems (LMS), and difficulty in designing a Smart App tailored to instructors’ and students’ interests. It is recommended that school administrators and policymakers continually revise SLE frameworks for a successful smart education. Future researchers can investigate how to promote personalized and adaptive learning in SLE and promising tools to assist instructors in technology-enhanced learning environments.},

Recommendation systems aid learners to select relevant courses and content based on their preferences, interest and learning goals from MOOC. Various factors are considered in course recommendation systems however little research has been done in recommending courses based on learning styles despite its significance laid down by various studies. Most studies have focused on content filtering matching with learners learning style instead from a course. This research study is oriented towards learning style-based course categorization using course content delivery information data from a MOOC platform. The Felder-Silverman learning style model (FSLSM) has been used to develop a course learning style support identification model. The effectiveness of the model developed is analyzed through an experimental study performed on real-time data due to absence of a standard data set for course contents and learning style relationships. The model threshold values are finetuned through the results obtained from the experimental. The application of the course learning style identification model is demonstrated by conducting test case studies consisting of users with different learning styles and recommending courses from a MOOC platform with matching learning style.},

 abstract = {Predictive uses of data are becoming widespread in institutional settings as actors seek to anticipate people and their activities. Predictive modeling is increasingly the subject of scholarly and public criticism. Less common, however, is scrutiny directed at the data that inform predictive models beyond concerns about homogenous training data or general epistemological critiques of data. In this paper, I draw from a qualitative case study set in higher education in the United States to investigate the making of data. Data analytics projects at universities have become more pervasive and intensive to better understand and anticipate undergraduate student bodies. Drawing from 12 months of ethnographic research at a large public university, I analyze the ways data personnel at the institution—data scientists, administrators, and programmers—sort student data into “attributes” and “behaviors,” where “attributes” are demographic data that students “can’t change.” “Behaviors,” in contrast, are data defined as reflective of what students can choose: attending and paying attention in class, studying on campus, among other data which personnel categorize as what students have control over. This discursive split enables the institution nudge students to make responsible choices according to behavior data that correlate with success in the predictive model. In discussing how personnel type, sort, stabilize, and nudge on behavior data, this paper examines the contingencies of data making processes and implications for the application of student data.},

For collaborative BL, self-regulated learning (SRL), self-efficacy and engagement are frequently referred to in BL studies and represent key elements of effective BL. Furthermore, the interaction of these elements correlates closely with the performance of students. There have been few research attempts to draw synergies and explore the relationship among these key elements. To address this gap, data were collected through a questionnaire and records on LMS from 125 students in a Chinese university. Descriptive analytics show that students fully recognize the positive effects of collaborative BL. Correlation analysis and regression analysis find that self-regulated learning (SRL) is significantly correlated with all factors except workload. It is also a significant predictor of behavioral engagement. Therefore, SRL proves to be central among the essential BL elements. Emotional engagement is significantly correlated to and interact with multiple key BL factors. Specifically, emotional engagement is a significant predictor of behavioral engagement. The findings offer insight into the interactions of key elements of BL and provide practical implications for improving BL learning design.},

Edge computing enables computing at the network’s edge and effectively avoids latencies while processing learners’ computational requests. The envisioned architecture was designed on the ETSI MEC ISG protocols and deployed on the university mobile cloud infrastructure. Additionally, a use case was designed, focusing the edge computing’s latency-avoiding ability, and executing it in a real-time environment involving sixteen students from an academic course. The execution results validated the architecture’s contribution, such as tasks executed in the local server, optimized learner privacy, reduced latencies, instant access, lowered bandwidth consumption, and continued tasks’ execution despite the failure of smart nodes. The result influences user acceptance and attracts designers to extend the architecture base focusing on machine learning algorithms (for learning analytics) and blockchain (to prevent malicious attacks) to improve the effectiveness of learning management system performance.},

Studies have shown that before introducing the technology to their pupils, educators should do a thorough assessment of the technology’s viability and possible acceptance in the classroom. However, not much is synthesized from the body of knowledge about the leadership and coupling of VR and AR in education, including its trends and direction of research in other domains. In this article, the bibliometric and content analysis has shown that interest in virtual reality and augmented reality has increased from 2018 to 2022 in the Web of Science database. The patterns formed from Vosviewer in the bibliometric analysis have also portrayed that Virtual reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) are used in many fields, including education, medicine, arts, engineering, business, and marketing. Other results from data mining showed the authors with the most publications in the field, their affiliated universities, and the source of publications. In the wake of the Covid-19 epidemic, these findings may also help improve educational opportunities for all students and the quality of instruction they receive. As implications, Virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) harness current technology to put digital content in the actual world, enabling consumers to have a more meaningful interaction with it on desktop or hand-held devices. This bibliometric research shows that animation, 3D graphics, and sound may replace more traditional ways of schooling in the future.},

Our objective was to identify and analyze the characteristics of educational practices that are being developed in higher education and to assess the value that technology brings to educational practice. We conducted a systematic review of academic papers published in scientific journals: a corpus of 1,207 articles from six journals included in indexed databases (JCR and SJR), selected using Google Scholar Metrics. According to the various records screened, the study we present is based on 49 articles, published between 2018 and 2019.

The study population was enrolled in an Economic Education Program that ran from January to June 2021, and consisted of 15 participants. Three core subjects were selected as the sample. This sampling considered the problems that many education stakeholders complained about, that is, the low professional competency of the study program during online learning. This is why the three subjects were chosen as the core subjects in achieving the main competencies for prospective economics teachers. Thus, PjBL was conducted on three subjects: Development Economics, Human Resource Economics, and Development Planning. After the assessment was carried out, the data showed that positive student learning experiences tended to be higher than negative ones, and P21 ability aspects were much higher than critical thinking and collaboration.},

 abstract = {Demand for online education has increased in recent decades. Uptake of postgraduate nursing education in this mode is on the rise, yet many students do not achieve completion. Student engagement is vital to success in online postgraduate nursing programs. Technology enables a more efficient means of monitoring engagement, yet limited literature is available on how the design of online postgraduate nursing programs impacts student engagement. This integrative review aims to identify barriers and facilitators to engaging in online postgraduate nursing programs. Four databases, including Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, Education Resources Information Center, Scopus, and Medline, were systematically searched to identify relevant literature published over the period 1990 to 2022. Fifteen papers met the inclusion criteria. Thematic analysis generated three themes: design and delivery, support and connectivity, and student factors and success. The findings of this review uncover the range of indiscriminate variables and experiences that students have with online learning, making engaging instructional design a complex process. Nursing faculty require time and resources to develop skills specific to delivering “distance” education without being distant to the students. This review concludes that online postgraduate nursing programs are not a panacea, with ethical issues identified for higher education providers.},

It seeks to understand how VTAs could be implemented in the classroom while ensuring student and teacher well-being, success, and happiness. Through interviews with fourteen different experts spanning industry, academia, and education, combined with extensive review of the existing literature and ecosystem of VTAs, research shows that VTAs are potentially a major aid in the context of exam review, after school tutoring, automated grading, and student performance reporting. However, they need to be created carefully with an attentive eye towards student support to ensure that the learning experience is not diminished. It must be clearly communicated to all stakeholders that the goal of a VTA is not to replace teachers, but rather to support them such that they can spend more time with students and less time on mundane tasks.},

 abstract = {OBJECTIVES Generative artificial intelligence (AI) models such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Google’s Bard have forced educators to consider how these tools will be efficiently utilized to improve medical education. This article investigates current literature on how generative AI is and could be used and implemented in undergraduate medical education (UME). METHODS A rapid review of the literature was performed utilizing a librarian-generated search strategy to identify articles published before June 30, 2023, in 6 databases (Pubmed, EMBASE.com, Scopus, ERIC via EBSCO, Computer Science Database via EBSCO, and CINAHL via EBSCO). Inclusion criteria were (1) a focus on osteopathic and/or allopathic UME and (2) a defined use or implementation strategy for generative AI. Two reviewers screened all articles, and data extraction was performed by 1 reviewer and confirmed by the other reviewer. RESULTS A total of 521 relevant articles were screened during this review. Forty-one articles underwent full-text review and data extraction. The majority of the articles were opinion pieces (9), case reports (8), letters to the editor (5), editorials (5), and commentaries (3) about the use of generative AI while 7 articles used qualitative and/or quantitative methods. The literature is best divided into 5 categories of uses for generative AI in UME: nonclinical learning assistant, content developer, virtual patient interaction, clinical decision-making tutor, and medical writing. The literature indicates generative AI tools’ greatest potential is for use as a virtual patient and clinical decision-making tutor. CONCLUSIONS While the possibilities proliferate for generative AI in UME, there remains a dearth of quantitative evidence of its use for improving learner outcomes. The majority of the literature opines the potential for utilization, but only 7 studies formally evaluated the results of using generative AI. Future research should focus on the effectiveness of incorporating generative AI into preclinical and clinical curricula in UME.},

 abstract = {While universities routinely use student data to monitor and predict student performance, there has been limited engagement with student and staff views, social and ethical issues, policy development, and ethical guidance. We reviewed peer-reviewed and grey-literature articles of 2007 to 2018 describing the perspectives of staff and students in tertiary education on the use of student-generated data in data analytics, including learning analytics. We used an ethics framework to categorize the findings. There was considerable variation but generally low awareness and understanding amongst students and staff about the nature and extent of data collection, data analytics, and use of predictive analytics. Staff and students identified potential benefits but also expressed concerns about misinterpretation of data, constant surveillance, poor transparency, inadequate support, and potential to impede active learning. This review supports the contention that consideration of ethical issues has failed to keep pace with the development of predictive analytics in the tertiary sector.},

 abstract = {The emergence of big data in educational contexts has led to new data-driven approaches to support informed decision making and efforts to improve educational effectiveness. Digital traces of student behavior promise more scalable and finer-grained understanding and support of learning processes, which were previously too costly to obtain with traditional data sources and methodologies. This synthetic review describes the affordances and applications of microlevel (e.g., clickstream data), mesolevel (e.g., text data), and macrolevel (e.g., institutional data) big data. For instance, clickstream data are often used to operationalize and understand knowledge, cognitive strategies, and behavioral processes in order to personalize and enhance instruction and learning. Corpora of student writing are often analyzed with natural language processing techniques to relate linguistic features to cognitive, social, behavioral, and affective processes. Institutional data are often used to improve student and administrational decision making through course guidance systems and early-warning systems. Furthermore, this chapter outlines current challenges of accessing, analyzing, and using big data. Such challenges include balancing data privacy and protection with data sharing and research, training researchers in educational data science methodologies, and navigating the tensions between explanation and prediction. We argue that addressing these challenges is worthwhile given the potential benefits of mining big data in education.},

 abstract = {Predicting students' academic performance is of paramount importance to educational institutions. If students' academic performance is predicted course-wise, semester-wise and year-wise then it will be helpful for students to a great extent. In this research article, we generate twenty nine dataset with the help of students' result analysis. Datasets 1 to 9 is the datasets of students' result in first attempt while datasets 10 to 19 represent datasets of students after passing all courses of semesters and datasets 20 to 29 is overall dataset of students' result analysis. To predict the course-wise, semester-wise and year-wise performance of students, we developed a framework titled as ECSYAPPS (Educational Course Semester Year-wise Academic Performance Prediction System) based on classification techniques and designed algorithm for analyzing students' performance in education sector. This ECSYAPPS predicts the course-wise, semester-wise and year-wise grade of students. Fifteen classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression (LR), Naive Bayes (NB), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Linear Support Vector Classification (LSVC), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Gradient Boosting (GB), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), Bagging, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Light Gradient-Boosting Machine (LightGBM), Categorical Boosting (CatBoost), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier (SGDC) are selected and applied on 29 datasets and compared on basis of performance parameters such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). These fifteen classification algorithms are under ten classifiers such as Linear Model, Naive Bayes, Tree, Support Vector Machine, Nearest Neighbors, Ensemble, xgboost, lightgbm, Discriminant Analysis and catboost. If the accuracy of two more classification algorithms for a dataset is same then in that case Precision, Recall, F1-score and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) are compared for deciding the best classification algorithm for the dataset. In this way, best classification algorithm is selected for each of 29 datasets. It is found that classifiers xgboost works best for eleven datasets while ensemble techniques Gradient Boosting and AdaBoost work best for two datasets and six datasets respectively among 29 datasets. Other classification algorithms such as Decision Tree, LightGBM, LDA, and KNN are noted to be best classification algorithm for two, four, three, and two datasets respectively. This framework is tested on new eight datasets related to students' result two methods such as K-Fold Cross-validation and Train-Validation-Test method. The results of this framework on new datasets shows that accuracy obtained on test dataset or validation dataset as compared to the accuracy obtained on old dataset is less than 6%. This framework will be helpful for students as well instructor. For students, it will help them to improve the performance of difficult courses from students'point of view in the examination while faculty can use this framework to improve pedagogical practices.},

The algorithm models social learning networks as a function of users knowledge seeking and knowledge disseminating tendencies across course topics and offers a means to optimize social learning networks by connecting users seeking and disseminating information on specific topics. We use the algorithm to analyze the social learning network manifest in the discussion format of a MOOC forum incorporating video lectures and problem assignments. As a measure of the degree that knowledge seekers and knowledge disseminators are connected in the network, we observe a very sparse network with few discussion participants and a limited range of topics. Hence, only small gains are available through optimization, since for a very sparse network, few connections can be made. The development of a metric for the analysis of social learning networks would provide instructors and researchers with a means to optimize online learning environments for empowering social learning. Finally, we discuss our findings with respect to the potential of self-optimizing discussion forums for supporting social learning online.},

Although research on SRL is expanding in recent years, much of the literature has relied on self-reporting tools to measure SRL. Online trace data analysis, an emerging approach, provides the promise of greater authenticity and convenience in measuring SRL as compared to self-reports. We conducted a systematic review of online trace data analysis that measured SRL in various learning platforms to address three research questions: “How did previous studies use online trace data as indicators of SRL?“, “What approaches are being used to interpret the online trace data?“, and “What are the challenges of using online trace data to measure SRL?“. We systematically searched seven bibliographic databases with specific inclusion and exclusion criteria. A total of 38 empirical studies were eventually examined. We leveraged the two most cited SRL models as theoretical basis and mapped the various online trace data into relevant SRL process to answer the first research question. Two commonly adopted approaches to interpret the online trace data were identified. Three key challenges pertaining to the use of trace data to measure SRL were identified: time segmentation, generalization, and validity. We discussed these challenges and the possible means to mitigate them. Finally, we propose a flowchart to guide future studies in conducting online trace data analysis in SRL research.},

 abstract = {Predicting academic performance using trace data from learning management systems is a primary research topic in educational data mining. An important application is the identification of students at risk of failing the course or dropping out. However, most approaches utilise past grades, which are not always available and capture little of the student's learning strategy. The end-to-end models we implement predict whether a student will pass a course using only navigational patterns in a multimedia system, with the advantage of not requiring past grades. We experiment on a dataset containing coarse-grained action logs of more than 100,000 students participating in hundreds of short course. We propose two approaches to improve the performance: a novel encoding scheme for trace data, which reflects the course structure while remaining flexible enough to accommodate previously unseen courses, and unsupervised embeddings obtained with an autoencoder. To provide insight into model behaviour, we incorporate an attention mechanism. Clustering the vector representations of student behaviour produced by the proposed methods shows that distinct learning strategies specific to low- and high-achievers are extracted.

 abstract = {With the increasing adoption of Learning Management Systems (LMS) in colleges and universities, research in exploring the interaction data captured by these systems is promising in developing a better learning environment and improving teaching practice. Most of these research efforts focused on course-level variables to predict student performance in specific courses. However, these research findings for individual courses are limited to develop beneficial pedagogical interventions at the student level because students often have multiple courses simultaneously. This paper argues that student-centric models will provide systematic insights into students' learning behavior to develop effective teaching practice. This study analyzed 1651 undergraduate student's data collected in Fall 2019 from computer science and information systems departments at a US university that actively uses Blackboard as an LMS. The experimental results demonstrated the prediction performance of student-centric models and explained the influence of various predictors related to login volumes, login regularity, login chronotypes, and demographics on predictive models. Our findings show that student prior performance and normalized student login volume across courses significantly impact student performance models. We also observe that regularity in student logins has a significant influence on low performing students and students from minority races. Based on these findings, the implications were discussed to develop potential teaching practices for these students. [For the full proceedings, see ED615472.]},

 abstract = {Recently, the Interactive-Constructive-Active-Passive (ICAP) framework has been gaining increasing prominence in cognitive and learning sciences. The ICAP theory asserts that students learn more deeply when they are cognitively engaged in generative and collaborative learning. Indeed, prior studies have established the value of the ICAP framework for predicting student learning. However, the framework has yet to become widely used by practitioners, possibly due to the lack of accessible resources for applying the framework instruction design. This study sought to fill that gap by implementing and validating the ICAP instructional rubric instrument to rate the design of college chemistry courses at a large public university in the southwest and exploring its relationships with several metrics of student performance via multiple regression analysis: a) level of participation; b) final exam grades; c) course grades; d) course retention; and e) course attrition. This study analyzed data from the university's learning management system and included student-level controls such as markers of prior academic performance (i.e., GPA and SAT scores) as well as student demographics. The findings of this study suggest that the ICAP framework may be a useful tool for instructors to improve course design. In addition, the ICAP framework's predictive claims on student deeper learning were further validated by the results of this study.

 abstract = {For researchers seeking to improve education, a common goal is to identify teaching practices that have causal benefits in classroom settings. To test whether an instructional practice exerts a causal influence on an outcome measure, the most straightforward and compelling method is to conduct an experiment. While experimentation is common in laboratory studies of learning, experimentation is increasingly rare in classroom settings, and to date, researchers have argued it is prohibitively expensive and difficult to conduct experiments on education in situ. To address this challenge, we present Terracotta (Tool for Education Research with RAndomized COnTrolled TriAls), an open-source web application that integrates with a learning management system to provide a comprehensive experimental research platform within an online class site. Terracotta automates randomization, informed consent, experimental manipulation of different versions of learning activities, and export of de-identified research data. Here we describe these features, and the results of a live classroom demonstration study using Terracotta, a preregistered replication of McDaniel et al. ("Journal of Applied Research in Memory and Cognition," 1(1), 18-26, 2012). Using Terracotta, we experimentally manipulated online review assignments so that consenting students alternated, on a weekly basis, between taking multiple-choice quizzes (retrieval practice) and reading answers to these quizzes (restudy). Students' performance on subsequent exams was significantly improved for items that had been in retrieval practice review assignments. This successful replication demonstrates that Terracotta can be used to experimentally manipulate consequential aspects of students' experiences in education settings.

 abstract = {Academic advising plays an important role in students' decision-making in higher education. Data-driven methods provide useful recommendations to students to help them with degree completion. Several course recommendation models have been proposed in the literature to recommend courses for the next semester. One aspect of the data that has yet to be explored is the suitability of the recommended courses taken together in a semester. Students may face more difficulty coping with the workload of courses if there is no relationship among courses taken within a semester. To address this problem, we propose to employ session-based approaches to recommend a set of courses for the next semester. In particular, we test two session-based recommendation models, CourseBEACON and CourseDREAM. Our experimental evaluation shows that session-based methods outperform existing popularity-based, sequential, and non-sequential recommendation approaches. Accurate course recommendation can lead to better student advising, which, in turn, can lead to better student performance, lower dropout rates, and better overall student experience and satisfaction.

 abstract = {This research explores the use of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) in Educational Data Mining (EDM) to improve the performance and explainability of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) models predicting at-risk students. Explainable predictions provide students and educators with more insight into at-risk indicators and causes, which facilitates instructional intervention guidance.&#xa0;Historically, low student retention has been prevalent across the globe as nations have implemented a wide range of interventions (e.g., policies, funding, and academic strategies) with only minimal improvements in recent years (Stolk et al., 2007). In the US, recent attrition rates indicate two out of five first-time freshman students will not graduate from the same four-year institution within six years (NCES, 2020). In response, emerging AI research leveraging recent advancements in Deep Learning has demonstrated high predictive accuracy for identifying at-risk students, which is useful for planning instructional interventions. However, research suggested a general trade-off between performance and explainability of predictive models (Arrieta et al., 2020; Gunning et al., 2019). Those that outperform, such as deep neural networks (DNN), are highly complex and considered black boxes (i.e., systems that are difficult to explain, interpret, and understand). The lack of model transparency/explainability results in shallow predictions with limited feedback prohibiting useful intervention guidance. Furthermore, concerns for trust and ethical use are raised for decision-making applications that involve humans, such as health, safety, and education. To address low student retention and the lack of interpretable models, this research explored the use of eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) in Educational Data Mining (EDM) to improve instruction and learning. More specifically, XAI has the potential to enhance the performance and explainability of AI/ML models predicting at-risk students. The scope of this study includes a hybrid research design comprising: (1) a systematic literature review of XAI and EDM applications in education; (2) the development of a theory-guided feature selection (TGFS) conceptual learning model; and (3) an EDM study exploring the efficacy of a TGFS XAI model. The EDM study implemented K-Means Classification for explorative (unsupervised) and predictive (supervised) analysis in addition to assessing Genetic Programming (GP), a type of XAI model, predictive performance, and explainability against common AI/ML models. Online student activity and performance data were collected from a learning management system (LMS) from a four-year higher education institution. Student data was anonymized and protected to ensure data privacy and security. Data was aggregated at weekly intervals to compute and assess the predictive performance (sensitivity, recall, and f-1 score) over time. Mean differences and effect sizes are reported at the 0.05 significance level. Reliability and validity are improved by implementing research best practices (J. Cohen, 1988; Field, 2018; He et al., 2016). [The dissertation citations contained here are published with the permission of ProQuest LLC. Further reproduction is prohibited without permission.

 abstract = {To meet the goal of understanding students' complex learning processes and maximizing their learning outcomes, the field of learning analytics delves into the myriad of data captured as students use computer assisted learning platforms. Although many platforms associated with learning analytics focus on students' performance, performance on learning related tasks is a limited measure of learning itself. In this chapter, the authors review research that leverages data collected in programs to understand specific learning processes and contribute to a robust vision of knowledge acquisition. In particular, they review work related to two important aspects of the learning process--students' problem-solving strategies and behavioral engagement--then provide an example of an effective math program that focuses on the learning process over correct or incorrect responses. Finally, they discuss ways in which the findings from this research can be incorporated into the development and improvement of computer assisted learning platforms, with the goal of maximizing students' learning outcomes.

 abstract = {Educational Data Mining (EDM) is an emerging field that aims to better understand students' behavior patterns and learning environments by employing statistical and machine learning methods to analyze large repositories of educational data. Analysis of variable data in the early stages of a course might be used to develop a comprehensive prediction model to prevent students' failure or dropout. This will assist instructors in intervening effectively. In this defense report, three major contributions in the field of educational data mining and learning analytics are presented. The first contribution is a framework to statistically compare different instructional modes and investigate their effects on students' academic performance. Our analysis is unique in the literature and is based on the "Rank Percentage" rather than students' course grades. The rank percentage allows us to make the academic scores more comparable. Previous studies have mainly focused on students' course grades to evaluate academic performance. A sample data set of around 500 students attending a Financial Engineering Course (IE201) is used to test the proposed approach. A total of four cohorts of students are considered, depending on the teaching modalities they attended: the traditional face-to-face (F2F) classroom, the transitional semester interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the two consecutive online semesters (asynchronous and synchronous). We aim to investigate the effect of the transition from F2F classes to online modes on different subgroups of students. Accordingly, we divide each student cohort into subgroups using criteria such as cumulative grade point average (GPA). We then utilize the Mann-Whitney U test for pair-wise comparisons between cohorts in each cumulative GPA subgroup. Our findings highlight that the differences between specific subgroups of students are significant. As a result of the transition to online learning, students with cumulative GPAs greater than 2.90 have been negatively affected. It is, however, hard to draw a firm conclusion for students with cumulative GPAs below 2.90. Our results encourage researchers to investigate the effectiveness of various teaching modes on subgroups of students when comparing populations with different instruction modes. The second contribution of this dissertation is a framework by which students' learning style features can be utilized to enhance their academic performance and detect at-risk students early in the course. A publicly available dataset called Open University Learning Analytics Dataset (OULAD) is used to test the proposed approach. We employ the Felder-Silverman Learning Style Model (FSLSM) as the basis for mapping learners' interaction with the Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) to learning style (LS) features. LSs extracted from the course's first and second quarters and the learners' demographic features are used to train different prediction models to classify the second quarter assessment results into satisfactory and not satisfactory classes. A grid search is then implemented to determine the optimal values of LS features in the second quarter that maximize students' academic performance. Comparisons between the actual and optimal values of LS features in the second quarter are made based on defined thresholds and divided the learners into "Supported" and "Not Supported." Finally, the Mann-Whitney U test is used to compare the second quarter assessment grade between Supported and Not Supported groups. The findings depict that the statistical differences are significant, i.e., students in the Supported group achieved better grades in the second quarter assessment compared to the Not Supported group. Adopting an individual's learning style to the appropriate educational intervention can significantly impact student performance. The final contribution is to propose an approach to personalizing learning resources based on students' learning styles in an online learning environment. A student's learning style affects their learning attitude, satisfaction level, and academic performance. So, to maintain learners' interest and enhance their academic performance, it is crucial to consider their learning styles when developing e-learning systems. Students' interactions with the online learning environment are captured in a large amount of data during the learning process. The collected data can be used to analyze learners' behavior to determine their learning styles. In the proposed approach, the learning style and demographic features are then utilized for training machine learning models to predict students' academic performance in each quarter of different courses. The most accurate prediction model for each quarter is then used to find learning style features that maximize students' pass rates. We statistically prove that students whose actual learning style features were close enough to the ones calculated by the approach achieved better grades. To improve students' academic performance each quarter, we suggest two strategies based on the learning style features calculated by the process.

 abstract = {Assessing students' performance in online learning could be executed not only by the traditional forms of summative assessments such as using essays, assignments, and a final exam, etc. but also by more formative assessment approaches such as interaction activities, forum posts, etc. However, it is difficult for teachers to monitor and assess students' learning activities using the log data. To provide teachers with a more comprehensive view of students' distinct learning behaviour patterns, and to supply personalized interventions and support to meet the specific needs of each learning group, this study focuses on how to automatically acquire learning logs from Manaba, a Japanese commercial LMS, and how to cluster students' learning activities using the k-means algorithm. Firstly, we developed a program using Python to scrape students' learning activity log information from the Manaba web pages. We collected 56446 lines of clickstreams log data from 121 students in two computer literacy hybrid classes in the fall semester of 2022 (2022/9-2023/1). Secondly, we convert the raw logs into a structured dataset with 33 features which represent each student's learning activities. Then we extract and select 15 features representing three perspectives: raw activity, time on task, and learning frequency. Thirdly, we grouped students' learning activity patterns with the three perspectives into 5 clusters by the k-means clustering algorithm. As a result, this study identified five distinct learning activity patterns depending on how much, how long and how often the students learned online. For example, cluster 1 seldom learned but spent time on learning whom we considered the disengaged or struggling students, and cluster 5 had more learning activities with little time on each activity whom we considered the well-self-regulated students. The results of this study contribute to how to monitor students' learning activity in online learning and how to assess and support student's learning by their learning activity patterns.

 abstract = {First-Year Engineering (FYE) programs are a critical part of engineering education, yet they are quite complex settings. Given the importance and complexity of FYE programs, research to better understand student learning and inform design and assessment in FYE programs is imperative. Therefore, this dissertation showcases various uses of data analytics and educational theory to support decision-making when designing and assessing FYE programs. Three case studies shape this dissertation work. Each study encompasses a variety of educational data sources, analytical methods, and decision-making tools to produce valuable findings for FYE classrooms. In addition, this dissertation also discusses the potential for incorporating data analytics into FYE programs. A more detailed description of the research methods, a summary of findings, and a list of resulting publications for each case study follows. The first case study investigated the relationship between two related Computational Thinking (CT) practices, data practices and computational problem-solving practices, in acquiring other CT competencies in a large FYE course setting. This study explored the following research questions: (1) What are the different student profiles that characterize their foundational CT practices at the beginning of the semester? and (2) Within these profiles, what are the progressions that students follow in the acquisition of advanced CT practices? To answer these questions, N-TARP Clustering, a novel machine learning algorithm, and sound statistical tools were used to analyze assessment data from the course at the learning objective level. Such a hybrid approach was needed due to the high-dimensionality and homogeneity characteristics of the assessment. It was found that early mastery of troubleshooting and debugging is linked to the successful acquisition of more complex CT competencies. This research was published in an article in the journal IEEEAccess. The second case study examined self-regulation components associated with students' successful acquisition of CT skills using students' reflections and assessment data. This research was grounded in three subprocesses of the Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) theory: strategic planning, access to feedback, and self-evaluation. This study responded to the following research question: What is the relationship between SRL subprocesses: access to feedback, self-evaluation, strategic planning, and the acquisition of CT skills in an FYE course? Results from a structural equation model, which reflects the complexity and multidimensionality of the analysis, provided evidence of the relevance of the three subprocesses in the acquisition of CT skills and highlighted the importance of self-assessment as key to success in the acquisition of programming skills. Furthermore, self-assessment was found to effectively represent the task strategy and access to feedback from the students. This analysis led to the understanding that even though the three SRL subprocesses are relevant for the student's success, self-evaluation serves as a catalyst between strategic planning and access to feedback. A resulting article from this case study will be submitted to the International Journal of Engineering Education in the future. Lastly, the third study aimed to predict the students' learning outcomes using data from the Learning Management System (LMS) in an FYE course. The following research questions were explored in this case study: (1) What type of LMS objects contain information to explain students' grades in a FYE course? (2) Is the inclusion of a human operator during the data transformation process significant to the analysis of learning outcomes? Two different sections of a large FYE course were used, one serving as a training data set and the other one as a testing data set. Two logistic regression models were trained. The first model corresponded to a common approach for building a predictive model, using the data from the LMS directly. The second model considered the specifics of the course by transforming the data from aggregate user interaction to more granular categories related to the content of the class. A comparison was made between the predictive measures, e.g., precision, accuracy, recall, and F1 score for both models. The findings from the transformed data set indicate that students' engagement with the career exploration curriculum was the strongest predictor of students' final grades in the course. This is a fascinating finding because the amount of weight the career assignments contributed to the overall course grade was relatively low. This study will be presented at the 2022 American Society of Engineering Education (ASEE) national conference in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

@article{ED641478,
 abstract = {Educational data mining focuses on exploring increasingly large-scale data from educational settings, such as Learning Management Systems (LMS), and developing computational methods to understand students' behaviors and learning settings better. There has been a multitude of research dedicated to studying the student learning process, leading to multiple commonly cited frameworks and theories that characterize students' learning behaviors. However, the most recent focus of interest argued that developing efficient models with actionable suggestions that help understand student learning behaviors and contribute to their academic outcomes is needed. Existing studies investigated various individual, emotional, and social factors related to student learning behaviors by analyzing fine-grained data samples collected by LMS at the student level but fail to incorporate the dynamics of learning behaviors and fail to examine the whole image of the student learning lives. For instance, most research in student learning behavior focuses on specific courses and related academic performance but did not consider that students always take multiple courses simultaneously. Therefore, the implications and knowledge from the static understanding of students' learning behavior in an isolated specific course may be limited to generate actionable strategies to help students. This dissertation was motivated to explore large-scale data, especially for examining the learning behavior's dynamics and developing student-centric models. The resulting knowledge has been recognized by publications in top-level international conferences in educational data mining and artificial intelligence in education. The first research attempt of my research introduced a new computational method based on psychological theories in affect dynamics to track dynamic student behaviors and developed a novel explanation method based on Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME). The second research attempt focused on developing computational models at the student level to predict their academic performance based on LMS data at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County. The findings from this work showed that student login volume and their prior performance significantly impact student performance. Additionally, this research focused on exploring causal relationships between student LMS behaviors and their academic performance. The causal analysis strengthened our findings in computational modeling by showing a significant cause-and-effect relationship between student login behaviors and their academic performance. The conclusions from this work will empower intervention techniques that improve student emotion regulation capabilities. The student-centric models developed in this study reported the positive impact of student login behaviors on their academic performance. This understanding will enable LMS developers and school administrators to design and develop interactive systems that deliver course content effectively.

 abstract = {Online education is fast growing due to its accessibility and scalability, but engineering has fallen behind other fields in adopting and researching the online educational format. Student course-level attrition is a significant issue in online courses. The goal of this dissertation is to better understand the factors that impact course level persistence decisions among online undergraduate engineering students. Three different research methodologies were employed for this study: a systematic literature review (SLR), learning analytics and data mining, and multi-level modeling. The SLR focuses on understanding the temporal trends and findings from research in online engineering education. A total of thirty-nine articles published between 2011 to 2020 met inclusion criteria, and the synthesis of these articles revealed five themes: content design and delivery, student engagement and interactions, assessment, feedback, and challenges in online engineering. Theoretical, methodological, and publication trends across the forty articles were also summarized. Data for the second study was compiled from 81 courses contained within three online, ABET-accredited undergraduate engineering degree programs at a large, public institution in the southwestern United States. The students' learning management system (LMS) interaction data was utilized to create features that represent the amount of time students spent on different course activities and how those times differed from "typical" interaction patterns among students in the same course. Association rule mining was used to develop rules that describe the behavior of students who completed the course (i.e., completers) and those who opted to withdraw (i.e., leavers). The best measure of student engagement was determined to be the mathematical difference between the percentages of completer and leaver rules met by each student. Finally, multi-level modeling was used to examine the impact of interpersonal interactions on online undergraduate engineering students' course-level persistence intentions. The data for this study was gathered from online courses during the 2019-2020 academic year. Students completed questionnaires about their course and related persistence intentions twelve times during their 7.5-week online course. Students' perceptions of the course LMS dialog, instructor practices, and peer support were found to significantly predict their course persistence intentions.

This study describes students' navigational behavior in an e-learning setting by processing the LA data obtained from Blackboard LMS. This is an attempt to understand the navigational behavior of students and the relationship with learning performance. The study was carried out with 88 learners from a Malaysian private university. The course sites' log data and students' performance were analyzed, and the results were as follows: 4 navigational behaviors played an important role in student's academic performance which are active days, total learning time, number of views, and days delayed in accessing the assessment. Active learning from Tuesdays to Thursdays had a significant positive effect on performance. It was found that the higher activities (total learning time, number of journals viewing) translate to better performance. Days delayed in attempting assessments had a significant but mixed effect on performance, depending on the type of assessment. However, the number of logins is insignificant. The findings of this study provide empirical evidence of the importance of self-discipline in online learning and provide instructors with a predictive measure as a call for early intervention to help online students.

 abstract = {Universities are now compelled to attend to metrics that (re)shape our conceptualisation of the student experience. New technologies such as learning analytics (LA) promise the ability to target personalised support to profiled 'at risk' students through mapping large-scale historic student engagement data such as attendance, library use, and virtual learning environment activity as well as demographic information and typical student outcomes. Yet serious ethical and implementation issues remain. Data-driven labelling of students as 'high risk', 'hard to reach' or 'vulnerable' creates conflict between promoting personal growth and human flourishing and treating people merely as data points. This article argues that universities must resist the assumption that numbers and algorithms alone can solve the 'problem' of student retention and performance; rather, LA work must be underpinned by a reconnection with the agreed values relating to the purpose of higher education, including democratic engagement, recognition of diverse and individual experience, and processes of becoming. Such a reconnection, this article contends, is possible when LA work is designed and implemented in genuine collaboration and partnership with students.},

 abstract = {This study uses the log data from Moodle learning management system for predicting student learning performance in the first third of a semester. Since the quality of the data has great influence on the accuracy of machine learning, five major data transmission methods are used to enhance data quality of log file in the data preprocessing stage. Furthermore, the modified FRBCS-CHI (fuzzy rule-based classification system using Chi's technique) algorithm, based on the weighted consequence, is proposed to improve the prediction accuracy of classification. Thereafter, the confusion matrix with two dimensions is employed to illustrate the prediction results, such as false positives, false negatives, true positives, and true negatives, which are further used to produce the parameters of prediction performance, including the precision rate, the recall rate, and the F-measure. From the results of experiment, the proposed modified FRBCS-CHI method will have higher prediction accuracy than the original FRBCS-CHI method.},

 abstract = {The measurement of student performance during their progress through university study provides academic leadership with critical information on each student's likelihood of success. Academics have traditionally used their interactions with individual students through class activities and interim assessments to identify those "at risk" of failure/withdrawal. However, modern university environments, offering easy on-line availability of course material, may see reduced lecture/tutorial attendance, making such identification more challenging. Modern data mining and machine learning techniques provide increasingly accurate predictions of student examination assessment marks, although these approaches have focussed upon large student populations and wide ranges of data attributes per student. However, many university modules comprise relatively small student cohorts, with institutional protocols limiting the student attributes available for analysis. It appears that very little research attention has been devoted to this area of analysis and prediction. We describe an experiment conducted on a final-year university module student cohort of 23, where individual student data are limited to lecture/tutorial attendance, virtual learning environment accesses and intermediate assessments. We found potential for predicting individual student interim and final assessment marks in small student cohorts with very limited attributes and that these predictions could be useful to support module leaders in identifying students potentially "at risk."},

 abstract = {Prediction of student performance is one of the most important subjects of educational data mining. Artificial neural networks are seen to be an effective tool in predicting student performance in e-learning environments. In the studies carried out with artificial neural networks, performance predictions based on student scores are generally made, but students' use of learning management system is not focused. In this study, performances of 3518 university students, who studying and actively participating in a learning management system, were tried to be predicted by artificial neural networks in terms of gender, content score, time spent on the content, number of entries to content, homework score, number of attendance to live sessions, total time spent in live sessions, number of attendance to archived courses and total time spent in archived courses variables. Since it is difficult to interpret how much input variables in artificial neural networks contribute to predicting output variables, these networks are called black boxes. Also, in this study the amount of contribution of input variables on the prediction of output variable was also examined. The artificial neural network created as a result of the study makes a prediction with an accuracy of 80.47%. Finally, it was found that the variables of number of attendance to the live classes, the number of attendance to archived courses and the time spent in the content contributed most to the prediction of the output variable.},

 abstract = {Higher education institutes are increasingly turning their attention to web-based learning management systems. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether data collected from LMS can be used to predict student performance in classrooms that use LMS to supplement face-to-face teaching. Data was collected from eight courses spread across two semesters at a private university in Lebanon. Event history analysis was used to investigate whether the probability of logging in was related to the gender and grade of the students. Results indicate that students with higher grades login more frequently to the LMS, that females login more frequently than males, and that student login activity increases as the semester progresses. As a result, this study shows that login activity can be used to predict the academic performance of students. These findings suggest that educators in traditional face-to-face classes can benefit from educational data mining techniques that are applied to the data collected by learning management systems in order to monitor student performance.},

 abstract = {E-learning platforms and processes face several challenges, among which is the idea of personalizing the e-learning experience and to keep students motivated and engaged. This work is part of a larger study that aims to tackle these two challenges using a variety of machine learning techniques. To that end, this paper proposes the use of k-means algorithm to cluster students based on 12 engagement metrics divided into two categories: interaction-related and effort-related. Quantitative analysis is performed to identify the students that are not engaged who may need help. Three different clustering models are considered: two-level, three-level, and five-level. The considered dataset is the students' event log of a second-year undergraduate Science course from a North American university that was given in a blended format. The event log is transformed using MATLAB to generate a new dataset representing the considered metrics. Experimental results' analysis shows that among the considered interaction-related and effort-related metrics, the number of logins and the average duration to submit assignments are the most representative of the students' engagement level. Furthermore, using the silhouette coefficient as a performance metric, it is shown that the two-level model offers the best performance in terms of cluster separation. However, the three-level model has a similar performance while better identifying students with low engagement levels.},

 abstract = {Learning management systems (LMSs) are ubiquitous components of the academic technology experience for learners across a wide variety of instructional contexts. Learners' interactions within an LMS are often contingent upon how instructors architect a module, course, or program of study. Patterns related to these learner interactions, often referred to as learning analytics implementation (LAI), can be represented by combining system-level LMS data with course-level design decisions to inform more granular insights into learner behaviour. The purpose of this paper is to use the LAI framework, specifically the principles of coordination and comparison (Wise & Vytasek, 2017), to examine how learner interaction patterns associated with LMS-use variables correspond to deliberate learning design decisions and course outcomes for a group of courses in the same undergraduate writing program. Visualizations of learner activity exhibited similar patterns of learner engagement across courses, corroborating the observation that design decisions heavily influence learner behaviour. Predictive analyses demonstrated strong influence of LMS use on final grades while accounting for course instructor. That is, while page views were not related to final grade, the length of discussion entries was often predictive. These results suggest that students who practised writing more -- the main learning objective of this course -- had higher final grades, regardless of variations in instructor and semester.},

 abstract = {Precision education is now recognized as a new challenge of applying artificial intelligence, machine learning, and learning analytics to improve both learning performance and teaching quality. To promote precision education, digital learning platforms have been widely used to collect educational records of students' behavior, performance, and other types of interaction. On the other hand, the increasing volume of students' learning behavioral data in virtual learning environments provides opportunities for mining data on these students' learning patterns. Accordingly, identifying students' online learning patterns on various digital learning platforms has drawn the interest of the learning analytics and educational data mining research communities. In this study, the authors applied data analytics methods to examine the learning patterns of students using an ebook system for one semester in an undergraduate course. The authors used a clustering approach to identify subgroups of students with different learning patterns. Several subgroups were identified, and the students' learning patterns in each subgroup were determined accordingly. In addition, the association between these students' learning patterns and their learning outcomes from the course was investigated. The findings of this study provide educators opportunities to predict students' learning outcomes by analyzing their online learning behaviors and providing timely intervention for improving their learning experience, which achieves one of the goals of learning analytics as part of precision education.},

 abstract = {This study compared student engagement and performance in both open educational resources (OER) (n[open textbook users fall 2018] = 72) and traditional textbook (n[traditional textbook users fall 2017] = 66) classes. Data were drawn from the Learning Management System (LMS). Results show (1) final grades in the OER class were on a par with the traditional textbook class, and (2) OER equalize student engagement and performance by narrowing the dispersions of page views, on-time assignment submissions (OTAS), attendance, and final grades. (3) OER increased attendance and lessened excessive dependence on LMS course materials recorded in the traditional class. (4) The indirect effect of attendance on final grades was stronger than the direct effect of OTAS in the OER class. Attendance provided the opportunity for the instructor and students to be on the "same page," which helps students better assimilate course content and comprehend lectures. (5) The availability of textbooks appears to be a factor influencing student course success. However, it remains unknown how much of the variance was explained by OER. It is apparent that OER are more important than ever in elevating overall student academic success.},

 abstract = {Awareness of students' learning status, and maintaining students' focus and attention during class are important issues in classroom management. Several observation instruments have been designed for human observers to document students' engagement in class, but the processes are time-consuming and laborious. Recently, with the development of artificial intelligent technologies, artificial intelligence in education (AIED) has become an important research topic. Several studies have applied image recognition technologies to determine students' learning status. However, little research has employed both sensor technology and image recognition technology in learning status analysis. Moreover, it remains unknown if learning status analysis is accurate enough to substitute for human observers. Furthermore, no feedback has been provided individually to students to manage their learning status by maintaining their attention in class. In this paper, a learning status management system in an intelligent classroom is proposed. Several types of information about students were detected and collected by both sensor technology and image recognition technology, and a Bayesian classification network was employed to inference the students' learning status. Moreover, the system includes a feedback mechanism, which not only provides the results of the just-in-time learning status analysis to teachers, but also notifies students who are detected as being unfocused in class. Two experiments were conducted to verify the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed system. Results showed that the learning status analysis highly corresponded to the observation of human beings, and the students were more attentive in class.},

 abstract = {The online homework system WeBWorK has been successfully used at several hundred colleges and universities. Despite its popularity, the WeBWorK system does not provide detailed metrics of student performance to instructors. In this article, we illustrate how an analysis of the log files of the WeBWorK system can provide information such as the amount of time students spend on WeBWorK assignments and how long they persist on problems. We estimate the time spent on an assignment by combining log file events into sessions of student activity. The validity of this method is confirmed by cross referencing with another time estimate obtained from a learning management system. As an application of these performance metrics, we contrast the behaviour of students with WeBWorK scores less than 50% with the remainder of the class in a first year Calculus course. This reveals that on average, the students who perform poorly on their homework start later, have shorter activity sessions, and are less persistent when solving problems. We conclude by discussing the implications of WeBWorK analytics for instructional practices and for the future of learning analytics in undergraduate mathematics education.},

Based on a theoretical framework adapted from Community of Inquiry (CoI) framework by Garrison et al. (2000), the data were segregated into three groups for analysis: Student Engagement, Course Content and Teacher Input. The data analysis revealed a positive correlation between Student Engagement and Teacher Input, and interestingly, a negative correlation between Student Engagement and Course Content when a certain threshold was exceeded. The findings of the study offer useful suggestions for future course design, and pedagogical approaches teachers can adopt to foster student engagement.},

The study was conducted in an English for academic purposes (EAP) course at a Hong Kong university that had already implemented blended learning for several years.

 abstract = {One of the main current challenges in Educational Data Mining and Learning Analytics is the portability or transferability of predictive models obtained for a particular course so that they can be applied to other different courses. To handle this challenge, one of the foremost problems is the models' excessive dependence on the low-level attributes used to train them, which reduces the models' portability. To solve this issue, the use of high-level attributes with more semantic meaning, such as ontologies, may be very useful. Along this line, we propose the utilization of an ontology that uses a taxonomy of actions that summarises students' interactions with the Moodle learning management system. We compare the results of this proposed approach against our previous results when we used low-level raw attributes obtained directly from Moodle logs. The results indicate that the use of the proposed ontology improves the portability of the models in terms of predictive accuracy. The main contribution of this paper is to show that the ontological models obtained in one source course can be applied to other different target courses with similar usage levels without losing prediction accuracy.},

In fully online mode, students cannot track their performance level, their progress in the course, and their performances compared to the rest of the class. This paper presents research work conducted at the University of Colombo School of Computing (UCSC), Sri Lanka, to solve the above problems and facilitate students learning in fully online and blended learning environments using Learning Analytics. The research objective is to design and create a Technology Enhanced Learning Analytics (TELA) dashboard for improving students' motivation, engagement, and grades. The Design Science research strategy was followed to achieve the objectives of the research. Initially, a literature survey was conducted analyzing features and limitations in current Learning Analytic dashboards. Then, current Learning Analytic plugins for Moodle were studied to identify their drawbacks. Two surveys with 136 undergraduate students and interviews with 12 lecturers were conducted to determine required features of the TELA system. The system was designed as a Moodle Plugin. Finally, an evaluation of the system was done with third-year undergraduate students of the UCSC. The results showed that the TELA dashboard can improve students' motivation, engagement, and grades. As a result of the system, students could track their current progress and performance compared to the peers, which helps to improve their motivation to engage more in the course. Also, the increased engagement in the course enhances the student's self-confidence since the student can see continuous improvement of his/her progress and performance which in turn improves the student's grades.},

 abstract = {One of the main problems encountered in the online learning process is the low or absence of students' engagement. They may face problems with behavioral engagement, cognitive engagement, emotional engagement in online learning environments. It is thought that the problems related to students' engagements can be overcome with personalized metacognitive feedback support based on learning analytics. In this research, the effect of personalized metacognitive feedback support based on learning analytics in online learning for recommendation and guidance was investigated on student engagement. The research was designed in conformity with experimental design, and it was performed on 68 first graders at a university in Turkey. The procedure was conducted within the scope of the Computing II Course based on online learning. The participants were randomly apportioned to experimental and control groups. Students in the experimental group were provided with personalized metacognitive feedback support based on learning analytics for recommendation and guidance. This support was not given to the control group. The personalized metacognitive feedback support used in this research consists of two basic components. These: (a) Learning analytics reports created with data obtained from students' weekly learning management system usage; and (b) The second component of the feedback messages is the recommendations messages prepared personalized for each participant based on learning analytics reports. The data of the study was obtained by the students' engagement scale which is used as pretest and posttest. The findings of the study revealed that the experimental group students' engagement was higher than the control group. Based on the research findings, it was seen that providing personalized metacognitive feedback based on learning analytics to students in online learning would improve students' engagement. Therefore, it can be said that providing personalized metacognitive feedback based on learning analytics in online learning is a useful approach. This research has a novel and unique value in examining the effect of personalized metacognitive feedback based on learning analytics on students' engagement. In line with the findings obtained from the research, various suggestions were made for educators, administrators, and researchers.},

 abstract = {Blended learning pedagogical practices supported by learning management systems have become an important part of higher education curricula. In most cases, these blended curricula are evaluated through multimodal formative assessments. Although assessments can strongly affect student outcomes, research on the topic is limited. In this paper, we adopted a learning analytics approach to explore student engagement with formative assessments and the power of these assessments to predict student outcomes in an English for Academic Purposes courses in a Hong Kong university. The study retrieved the data logs from 7,815 students and used the data to analyze student engagement with the formative assessments. The results suggested that the students put effort into completing the assessments. The degree to which assessments predict learning outcomes depend on students' level of subject knowledge and their understanding of the relevance of the assessments. This study showed that learning analytics provided reliable evidence for understanding students' engagement and identifying at-risk students. Therefore, learning analytics research has the potential to inform pedagogical practice.},

This study predicts student engagement at an early phase of a Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) course by analyzing data collected from consecutive years. The prediction model is developed using machine learning techniques applied to a subset of Open University Learning Analytics Dataset, provided by Open University (OU), Britain. The investigated data belongs to 7,775 students who attended social science courses for consecutive assessment years. The experiments are conducted with a reduced feature set to predict whether the students are highly or lowly engaged in the courses. The attributes indicating students' interaction with the VLE, their scores, and final results are the most contributing variables for the predictive analysis. Based on these variables, a reduced feature vector is constructed. The baseline used in the study is the linear regression model. The model's best results showed 95% accurate, 95% precise, and 98% relevant results with the Random Forest classification algorithm. Early prediction's relevant features are a subset of click activities, which provided a functional interface between the students and the VLE.},

 abstract = {This study examines how student and instructor participation in online discussions impacts students' course performance. The context for the study is university introductory online mathematics/statistics courses, which typically have much higher failure rates than their face-to-face counterparts. Using text-mining techniques, we analyze online discussion data automatically collected by a Learning Management System across five years from 2869 students in 72 online courses, who collectively contributed 20,884 posts. These semi-automated techniques enable a broader and more scalable view of participation behaviors by investigating: (1) student posting and non-posting behaviors (called online speaking and listening, respectively), (2) the textual content of posts, and (3) instructors' strategies for structuring discussions. Multilevel modeling results show that online listening behaviors significantly predict students' course performance. Further, students' posts that built on other contributions or applied new knowledge have the highest predictive value in terms of course performance. Finally, the instructors' use of open-ended prompts is the only variable positively and significantly links to students' course performance. Links to theory, instructional practice, and educational data mining are discussed.},

 abstract = {This paper describes the design, implementation and research of the Cyber Sleuth Science Lab (CSSL), an innovative educational program and supporting virtual learning environment, that combines pedagogical theory, gender inclusive instruction strategies, scientific principles/practices, gamification methods, computational thinking, and real-world problem solving. This program provides underrepresented youth, especially girls, with digital forensic knowledge, skills and career pathways, challenging them to explore complex social issues related to technology and to become cyber sleuths using real-world digital forensic methods and tools to solve investigative scenarios. Students also learn about related careers while improving their cyber street smarts. The CSSL incorporates additional "outside of the computer" activities to strengthen students' engagement such as structured in-classroom discussions, mock trials, and in-person interactions with practitioner role models. The CSSL was piloted in various forms to assess the suitability for in-school and out-of-school settings, and the students predominantly represented racial minorities. Research in this project relied on a mixed methods approach for data collection and analysis, including qualitative and quantitative methods, reinforced using learning analytics generated from the students clicking through the interface and interacting with the system. Analysis of gathered data indicate that the virtual learning environment developed in this project is highly effective for teaching digital forensic knowledge, skills, and abilities that are directly applicable in the workplace. Furthermore, the strategies for gender inclusive STEM instruction implemented in CSSL are effective for engaging girls without being harmful to boys' engagement. Learning STEM through digital forensic science taps into girls' motivations to address real-world problems that have direct relevance to their lives, and to protect and serve their community. After participating in the educational program, girls expressed a significantly greater increase in interest, relative to boys, in learning more about careers related to digital forensics and cybersecurity.},

 abstract = {Purpose: This study aims to investigate the feasibility of developing general predictive models for using the learning management system (LMS) data to predict student performances in various courses. The authors focused on examining three practical but important questions: are there a common set of student activity variables that predict student performance in different courses? Which machine-learning classifiers tend to perform consistently well across different courses? Can the authors develop a general model for use in multiple courses to predict student performance based on LMS data? Design/methodology/approach: Three mandatory undergraduate courses with large class sizes were selected from three different faculties at a large Western Canadian University, namely, faculties of science, engineering and education. Course-specific models for these three courses were built and compared using data from two semesters, one for model building and the other for generalizability testing. Findings: The investigation has led the authors to conclude that it is not desirable to develop a general model in predicting course failure across variable courses. However, for the science course, the predictive model, which was built on data from one semester, was able to identify about 70% of students who failed the course and 70% of students who passed the course in another semester with only LMS data extracted from the first four weeks. Originality/value: The results of this study are promising as they show the usability of LMS for early prediction of student course failure, which has the potential to provide students with timely feedback and support in higher education institutions.},

 abstract = {Background: Formative assessments are vital for supporting learning and performance but are also considered to increase the workload of teachers. As self-assessments in higher education are increasingly facilitated via digital learning environments allowing to offer direct feedback and tracking students' digital learning behaviour these constraints might be reduced. Yet, learning analytics do not make sufficient use of data on assessments. Aims: This exploratory case study uses learning analytics methods for investigating students' engagement with self-assessments and how this relates to performance in the final exam and self-reported self-testing strategies. Materials & Methods: The research study has been conducted at a European university in a twelve-weeks course of a Bachelor's program in Economic and Business Education including n[subscript enroll] = 159 participants. During the semester, students were offered nine self-assessments each including three to eight tasks plus one mid-term and one exam-preparation self-assessment including all prior self-assessments tasks. The self-assessment interaction data for each student included: the results of the last self-assessment attempt, the number of processed self-assessment tasks, and the time spent on the last self-assessment attempt, the total self-assessment attempts, and the first as well as last access of each self-assessment. Data analytics included unsupervised machine learning and process mining approaches. Results: Findings indicate that students use the self-assessments predominantly before summative assessments. Two distinct clusters based on engagement with self-assessments could be identified and engagement was positively related to performance in the final exam. The findings from learning analytics data were also indicated by students' self-reported use of self-testing strategies. Discussion: With the help of multiple data from self-reports, formal exams, and a learning analytics system, the findings provided multiple perspectives on the use of self-assessments and their relationships with course performance. These findings call for applying assessment analytics and related frameworks in learning analytics as well as providing learners with related adaptive feedback. Conclusion: Future research might investigate different (self-report) variables for clustering, other student cohorts or self-assessment forms.},

 abstract = {As universities around the world have begun to use learning management systems (LMSs), more learning data have become available to gain deeper insights into students' learning processes and make data-driven decisions to improve student learning. With the availability of rich data extracted from the LMS, researchers have turned much of their attention to learning analytics (LA) applications using educational data mining techniques. Numerous LA models have been proposed to predict student achievement in university courses. To design predictive LA models, researchers often follow a data-driven approach that prioritizes prediction accuracy while sacrificing theoretical links to learning theory and its pedagogical implications. In this study, we argue that instead of complex variables (e.g., event logs, clickstream data, timestamps of learning activities), data extracted from online formative assessments should be the starting point for building predictive LA models. Using the LMS data from multiple offerings of an asynchronous undergraduate course, we analysed the utility of online formative assessments in predicting students' final course performance. Our findings showed that the features extracted from online formative assessments (e.g., completion, timestamps and scores) served as strong and significant predictors of students' final course performance. Scores from online formative assessments were consistently the strongest predictor of student performance across the three sections of the course. The number of clicks in the LMS and the time difference between first access and due dates of formative assessments were also significant predictors. Overall, our findings emphasize the need for online formative assessments to build predictive LA models informed by theory and learning design.},

 abstract = {Technological advances have significantly affected education, leading to the creation of online learning platforms such as virtual learning environments and massive open online courses. While these platforms offer a variety of features, none of them incorporates a module that accurately predicts students' academic performance and commitment. Consequently, it is crucial to design machine learning (ML) methods that predict student performance and identify at-risk students as early as possible. Graph representations of student data provide new insights into this area. This paper describes a simple but highly accurate technique for converting tabulated data into graphs. We employ distance measures (Euclidean and cosine) to calculate the similarities between students' data and construct a graph. We extract graph topological features (GF) to enhance our data. This allows us to capture structural correlations among the data and gain deeper insights than isolated data analysis. The initial dataset (DS) and GF can be used alone or jointly to improve the predictive power of the ML method. The proposed method is tested on an educational dataset and returns superior results. The use of DS alone is compared with the use of DS+GF in the classification of students into three classes: "failed", "at risk", and "good". The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) reaches 0.948 using DS, compared with 0.964 for DS+GF. The accuracy in the case of DS+GF varies from 84.5 to 87.3%. Adding GF improves the performance by 2.019% in terms of AUC and 3.261% in terms of accuracy. Moreover, by incorporating graph topological features through a graph convolutional network (GCN), the prediction performance can be enhanced by 0.5% in terms of accuracy and 0.9% in terms of AUC under the cosine distance matrix. With the Euclidean distance matrix, adding the GCN improves the prediction accuracy by 3.7% and the AUC by 2.4%. By adding graph embedding features to ML models, at-risk students can be identified with 87.4% accuracy and 0.97 AUC. The proposed solution provides a tool for the early detection of at-risk students. This will benefit universities and enhance their prediction performance, improving both effectiveness and reputation.},

 abstract = {Video clickstream behaviors such as pause, forward, and backward offer great potential for educational data mining and learning analytics since students exhibit a significant amount of these behaviors in online courses. The purpose of this study is to investigate the predictive relationship between video clickstream behaviors and students' test performance with two consecutive experiments. The first experiment was performed as an exploratory study with 22 university students using a single test performance measure and basic statistical techniques. The second experiment was performed as a conclusive study with 16 students using repeated measures and comprehensive data mining techniques. The findings show that a positive correlation exists between the total number of clicks and students' test performance. Those students who performed a high number of clicks, slow backward speed or doing backwards or pauses achieved better test performance than those who performed a lower number of clicks, or who used fast-backward or fast-forward. In addition, students' test performance could be predicted using video clickstream data with a good level of accuracy (Root Mean Squared Error Percentage (%RMSE) ranged between 15 and 20). Furthermore, the mean of backward speed, number of pauses, and number/percentage of backwards were found to be the most important indicators in predicting students' test performance. These findings may help educators or researchers identify students who are at risk of failure. Finally, the study provides design suggestions based on the findings for the preparation of video-based lectures.},

 abstract = {Apart from good instructional design and delivery, effective intervention is another key to strengthen student academic performance. However, intervention has been recognized as a great challenge. Most instructors struggle to identify at-risk students, determine a proper intervention approach, trace and evaluate whether the intervention works. This process requires extensive effort and commitment, which is impractical especially for large classes with few instructors. This paper proposes a platform, namely "i-Ntervene," that integrates Learning Management System (LMS) automatic code grader, and learning analytics features which can empower systematic learning intervention for large programming classes. The platform supports instructor-pace courses on both Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) and traditional classroom setting. The platform iteratively assesses student engagement levels through learning activity gaps. It also analyzes subject understanding from programming question practices to identify at-risk students and suggests aspects of intervention based on their lagging in these areas. Students' post-intervention data are traced and evaluated quantitatively to determine effective intervention approaches. This evaluation method aligns with the evidence-based research design. The developed i-Ntervene prototype was tested on a Java programming course with 253 first-year university students during the COVID-19 pandemic in VLE. The result was satisfactory, as the instructors were able to perform and evaluate 12 interventions throughout a semester. For this experimental course, the platform revealed that the approach of sending extrinsic motivation emails had more impact in promoting learning behavior compared to other types of messages. It also showed that providing tutorial sessions was not an effective approach to improving students' subject understanding in complex algorithmic topics. i-Ntervene allows instructors to flexibly trial potential interventions to discover the optimal approach for their course settings which should boost student's learning outcomes in long term.},

Then, we randomly assigned a portion of the students predicted to perform poorly to a science of learning to learn intervention where they were taught SRL study strategies. Learning outcome and log data (257 K events) were collected from n = 226 students. We used a complex systems framework to model the differences in SRL including the amount, interrelatedness, density and regularity of engagement captured in digital trace data (ie, logs). Differences were compared between students who were predicted to: (1) perform poorly (control, n = 48); (2) perform poorly and received intervention (treatment, n = 95); and (3) perform well (not flagged, n = 83). Results indicated that the regularity of students' engagement was predictive of course grade, and that the intervention group exhibited increased regularity in engagement over the control group immediately after the intervention and maintained that increase over the course of the semester. We discuss the implications of these findings in relation to the future of artificial intelligence and potential uses for monitoring student learning in online environments.},

The process of supporting the instructors and supervisors in monitoring students in order to upkeep them and combine training programs to get the best outcomes. It decreases the official warning signs and inefficient students' expulsions. Therefore, analysis of students' performance on various academic tests is critical for future skill development. Despite the fact that existing performance prediction systems based on Deep Learning (DL) technologies such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) have outperformed Machine Learning (ML) -based systems in the prediction task, there are still a few issues. Ignorance of relevant features, analysis limitations to the existing amount of data points, and ambiguity in student records are only a few of these issues. This research proposes a novel Student Academic Performance Predicting (SAPP) system to address these issues and enhance prediction accuracy. It has a better architecture that uses a combination of 4-layer stacked Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network, Random Forest (RF), and Gradient Boosting (GB) techniques to predict students' pass or fail outcomes. Additionally, the proposed SAPP system is compared to existing prediction systems using publicly accessible student OULAD dataset with an addition of self-curated emotional dataset. The performance of SAPP system is measured using Accuracy, Precision, F-measure, and Recall parameters. The results of proposed algorithm (LSTM + RF + B) is compared with LSTM + RF, LSTM + B and end to end DL models such as ANN, LSTM, RNN, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and most commonly utilized ML models in the literature such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), Naive Bayes (NB) and RF. The proposed SAPP system gained approximately 96% prediction accuracy that is comparatively higher than existing systems.},

Similar to gamification, personalized learning analytics dashboards can enhance student engagement. Objectives: This study explores the student experiences and academic achievements using a gamified dashboard in a large, introductory STEM course. Methods: We examined two groups of students enrolled in different sections of a one-semester-long physical geology course with a total enrollment of 223 students. The only difference between the groups was that one had access to the dashboard. The data collection included students' assignments, overall performances, and exam scores. Students in both sections completed a Science Literacy Concept Inventory survey at the beginning and end of the term. Additionally, students completed an end-of-term survey containing open-ended questions on their experience and interactions with specific elements. Results: Students shared mostly positive comments about their experience with the dashboard, and the final grade of students with access to the dashboard was 13% higher, on average, compared to their peers in the non-dashboard section. Conclusion: With low costs and little time invested, gamified dashboards could have a significant impact on student performance in large STEM lecture courses.},

 abstract = {Digital advances in the learning space have changed the contours of student engagement as well as how it is measured. Learning management systems and other learning technologies now provide information about student behaviors with course materials in the form of learning analytics. In the context of a large, integrated and interdisciplinary Core curriculum course in a graduate school of public health, this study undertook a pilot randomized controlled trial testing the effect of providing a "behavioral nudge" in the form of digital images containing specific information derived from learning analytics about past student behaviors and performance. The study found that student engagement varied significantly from week to week, but nudges linking coursework completion to assessment grade performance did not significantly change student engagement. While the a priori hypotheses of this pilot trial were not upheld, this study yielded significant findings that can guide future efforts to increase student engagement. Future work should include a robust qualitative assessment of student motivations, testing of nudges that tap into these motivations and a richer examination of student learning behaviors over time using stochastic analyses of data from the learning management system.},

 abstract = {Learning analytics (LA) is considered a promising field of study as it's helping to improve learning and the context in which it occurs. A learner's performance can be defined as how well students are learning in terms of knowledge and skills development and can be analyzed based on students' outcomes and engagement in the course. We have consolidated the work carried out from 2011 to 2022 to improve learners' performance using LA, describe criteria that define learners' performance, discuss parameters that impact learners' performance, and how predictive models can be created to forecast learners' performance using these parameters. Results showed that the data collected from log files of the Learning Management System (LMS) had been used to get insights into the learner's performance in online platforms and LA could bring incredible benefits in the field of the education sector, such as improvement of learners' involvement with learning activities as well as learning outcomes, identification of students at risk, providing real-time feedback, and personalization of learning. Hence, we can say usage of LA significantly helps learners' performance improvement in learning portals. But we can get better results if we augment data from log files of LMS with the learner's personal data from his birth to the current moment, which is a bit challenging with respect to data collection i.e., huge and from multiple sources.},

 abstract = {Students' academic performance prediction is one of the most important applications of Educational Data Mining (EDM) that helps to improve the quality of the education process. The attainment of student outcomes in an Outcome-based Education (OBE) system adds invaluable rewards to facilitate corrective measures to the learning processes. Furthermore, the explosive increase of e-learning platforms generates a large volume of data that demands the extraction of useful information using up-to-date techniques. Keeping this view in mind and to check the impact of various features on student outcomes during online classes, we have analyzed two sets of datasets; the Kalboard 360 dataset (a larger dataset) that contains academic, demographic as well as behavioral features which have been observed and recorded during the classes held and a local Institute dataset that does not acquire behavioral features. To achieve this, we have selected a few machine learning algorithms such as Decision Tree (J48), Naïve Bayes (NB), Random Forest (RF), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) to classify the students, along with a few filter-based feature selection methods like Info gain, gain ratio, and correlation features have been applied to select the key attributes. Finally, we have fine-tuned the learning parameters of MLP called "Opt-MLP" to get an optimized output and compared it with other classification models. Our experimental results conclude that Opt-MLP proves its superiority over other classification models by predicting an accuracy of 87.14% without the feature selection (WOFS) and 90.74% accuracy with the feature selection (WFS) method for data set 1 and an accuracy of 79.37% without feature selection and 97.08% with feature selection for dataset 2. But, when the students' behavioral feature is considered along with other features, the RF model provides 100% accuracy justifying that students' behavior during class hours has a great impact on attaining the students' outcomes.},

 abstract = {Purpose: Digital learning systems are crucial for education and data collected can analyse students learning performances to improve support. The purpose of this study is to design and build an asynchronous hardware and software system that can store data on a local device until able to share. It was developed for staff and students at university who are using the limited internet access in areas such as remote Northern Territory. This system can asynchronously link the users' devices and the central server at the university using unstable internet. Design/methodology/approach: A Learning Box has been build based on minicomputer and a web learning management system (LMS). This study presents different options to create such a system and discusses various approaches for data syncing. The structure of the final setup is a Moodle (Modular Object Oriented Developmental Learning Environment) LMS on a Raspberry Pi which provides a Wi-Fi hotspot. The authors worked with lecturers from X University who work in remote Northern Territory regions to test this and provide feedback. This study also considered suitable data collection and techniques that can be used to analyse the available data to support learning analysis by the staff. This research focuses on building an asynchronous hardware and software system that can store data on a local device until able to share. It was developed for staff and students at university who are using the limited internet access in areas such as remote Northern Territory. This system can asynchronously link the users' devices and the central server at the university using unstable internet. Digital learning systems are crucial for education, and data collected can analyse students learning performances to improve support. Findings: The resultant system has been tested in various scenarios to ensure it is robust when students' submissions are collected. Furthermore, issues around student familiarity and ability to use online systems have been considered due to early feedback. Research limitations/implications: Monitoring asynchronous collaborative learning systems through analytics can assist students learning in their own time. Learning Hubs can be easily set up and maintained using micro-computers now easily available. A phone interface is sufficient for learning when video and audio submissions are supported in the LMS. Practical implications: This study shows digital learning can be implemented in an offline environment by using a Raspberry Pi as LMS server. Offline collaborative learning in remote communities can be achieved by applying asynchronized data syncing techniques. Also asynchronized data syncing can be reliably achieved by using change logs and incremental syncing technique. Social implications: Focus on audio and video submission allows engagement in higher education by students with lower literacy but higher practice skills. Curriculum that clearly supports the level of learning required for a job needs to be developed, and the assumption that literacy is part of the skilled job in the workplace needs to be removed. Originality/value: To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first remote asynchronous collaborative LMS environment that has been implemented. This provides the hardware and software for opportunities to share learning remotely. Material to support low literacy students is also included.},

 abstract = {Virtual learning environments give students more autonomy over their learning than traditional face-to-face classes and require that students adapt the ways they consume and assimilate new information. One theory of this process is self-regulated learning, which is illustrated in Efklides' Metacognitive and Affective model of Self-Regulated Learning (MASRL). MASRL represents the interplay between cognition, metacognition, and affect, both within a learner and between a learner and a task. This study uses learning analytics to operationalize Efklides' MASRL model in order to investigate the extent to which a combination of cognitive, metacognitive, and affective variables explains students' learning outcomes. This research was conducted at a private American university with 119 undergraduate students enrolled in four sections of an online or hybrid Calculus I course in fall 2020 and spring 2021. Five cognitive variables were defined and measured according to the Cognitive Operational framework for Analytics (COPA). Three metacognitive variables measured students' engagement with the course, and three affective variables measured students' affective states, as evidenced by digital traces in the LMS. Learning outcomes in this study were measured by students' final course grades. Binary logistic regression revealed that two cognitive, one metacognitive, and two affective variables were significant in explaining whether students' learning outcomes would be above or below the median. The confusion matrix and the area under the Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve showed high accuracy and usefulness for this regression model. The implications of these findings for online/hybrid learners and Efklides' MASRL model are subsequently explored.},

 abstract = {Learning Analytics Dashboards (LADs) are gaining popularity as a platform for providing students with insights into their learning behaviour patterns in online environments. Existing LAD studies are mainly centred on displaying students' online behaviours with simplistic descriptive insights. Only a few studies have integrated predictive components, while none possess the ability to explain how the predictive models work and how they have arrived at specific conclusions for a given student. A further gap exists within existing LADs with respect to prescriptive analytics that generate data-driven feedback to students on how to adjust their learning behaviour. The LAD in this study attempts to address this gap and integrates a full spectrum of current analytics technologies for sense-making while anchoring them within theoretical educational frameworks. This study's LAD (SensEnablr) was evaluated for its effectiveness in impacting learning in a student cohort at a tertiary institution. Our findings demonstrate that student engagement with learning technologies and course resources increased significantly immediately following interactions with the dashboard. Meanwhile, results showed that the dashboard boosted the respondents' learning motivation levels and that the novel analytics insights drawn from predictive and prescriptive analytics were beneficial to their learning. This study, therefore, has implications for future research when investigating student outcomes and optimizing student learning using LAD technologies.},

Grade lists are the only necessary ingredient. Networks of courses will be constructed where the edges are populations of students that took both connected course nodes. Using idealized experiments and two real-world data sets, we show that the model, even though simple in its set-up, can constrain the properties of courses very well, as long as some basic requirements in the data set are met: (1) significant overlap in student populations, and thus information exchange through the network; (2) non-zero variance in the grades for a given course; and (3) some correlation between grades for different courses. The model can then be used to evaluate a curriculum, a course, or even subsets of students for a very wide variety of applications, ranging from program accreditation to exam fraud detection. We publicly release the code with examples that fully recreate the results presented here.},

This DBR-based, human-centred design process resulted in a dashboard that supported teachers in addressing their students' learning needs. To develop the dashboard features that could support teachers, we found that a design refinement process that drew on the insights of teachers with varying teaching experience, philosophies and teaching contexts strengthened the resulting outcome. The versatile nature of the approach, in terms of student learning outcomes, makes it useful for HCLA design efforts across diverse K-12 educational contexts.},

This has taken place because engagement enables students to perform physical and mental, goal-directed, and purpose-driven activities. Unfortunately, keeping students emotionally engaged during Emergency Remote Teaching (ERT) remains under-researched. Therefore, this study focused on scrutinizing how teachers maintained the students' emotional engagement during Emergency Remote Teaching, especially in the Indonesian English as a foreign language (EFL) context. English Education Department teachers at a state-owned university in Indonesia were involved as the research participants. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with two teachers during the data collection. The data were analyzed with Thematic Analysis (TA) (Braun & Clarke, 2006). The findings reported six main themes, namely (1) implementing proper teaching materials and instructional platforms during emergency remote teaching, (2) actualizing tolerance-based learning activities, (3) performing self-adaptation to technology-enhanced language teaching, (4) deploying contextualized teaching methods during emergency remote teaching, (5) applying eclectic instructional media during emergency remote teaching, and (6) utilizing constructive and humanizing online learning monitoring. Practically, TESOL practitioners, students, and policymakers can benefit from this study to realize how to maintain students' emotional engagement while performing teaching and learning activities during ERT.},

 abstract = {To prevent students from learning risks and improve teachers' teaching quality, it is of great significance to provide accurate early warning of learning performance to students by analyzing their interactions through an e-learning system. In existing research, the correlations between learning risks and students' changing cognitive abilities or learning states are still underexplored, and the personalized early warning is unavailable for students at different levels. To accurately identify the possible learning risks faced by students at different levels, this article proposes a personalized early warning approach to learning performance for college students via cognitive ability and learning state modeling. In this approach, students' learning process data and historical performance data are analyzed to track students' cognitive abilities in the whole learning process, and model their learning states from four dimensions, i.e., learning quality, learning engagement, latent learning state, and historical learning state. Then, the Adaboost algorithm is used to predict students' learning performance, and an evaluation rule with five levels is designed to dynamically provide multilevel personalized early warning to students. Finally, the comparative experiments based on real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach could effectively predict all students' learning performance, and provide accurate early warning services to them.},

 abstract = {In a higher education context, students are expected to take charge of their learning by deciding "what" to learn and "how" to learn. While the learning analytics (LA) community has seen increasing research on the "how" to learn part (i.e., researching methods for supporting students in their learning journey), the "what" to learn part is still underinvestigated. We present a case study of curriculum analytics and its application to a dataset of 243 students of the bachelor's program in the broad discipline of health sciences to explore the effects of course choices on students' academic performance. Using curriculum metrics such as grading stringency, course temporal position, and duration, we investigated how course choices differed between high- and low-performing students using both temporal and sequential analysis methods. We found that high-performing students were likely to pick an elective course of low difficulty. It appeared that these students were more strategic in terms of their course choices than their low-performing peers. Generally, low-performing students seemed to have made suboptimal choices when selecting elective courses; e.g., when they picked an elective course of high difficulty, they were less likely to pick a following course of low difficulty. The findings of this study have design implications for researchers, program directors, and coordinators, because they can use the results to (i) update the course sequencing, (ii) guide students about course choices based on their current GPA (such as through course recommendation dashboards), (iii) identify bottleneck courses, and (iv) assist higher education institutions in planning a more balanced course roadmap to help students manage their workload effectively.},

 abstract = {Monitoring students' academic progress is vital for ensuring timely completion of their studies and supporting at-risk students. Educational Data Mining (EDM) utilizes machine learning and feature selection to gain insights into student performance. However, many feature selection algorithms lack performance forecasting systems, limiting their ability to predict future academic success accurately. To address this, we propose FeatureX, a hybrid approach aiming to select high-performing features that impact student quality and reduce dropout rates. FeatureX integrates filter-based and wrapper-based methods to identify relevant features for predicting student performance. This approach enhances educational experiences by optimizing resource allocation and support services. Additionally, the Confidence-Weighted Fusion Voting Classifier (CWFVC) Algorithm supplements feature selection with performance forecasting capabilities, improving accuracy by combining diverse machine learning classifiers. The research evaluates FeatureX using Decision Trees, Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks. Performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, measure FeatureX's effectiveness. Results show that FeatureX achieves the highest accuracy with a subset of ten features, effectively identifying influential predictors. The CWFVC Algorithm further enhances performance forecasting accuracy, enabling timely identification of at-risk students and reducing dropout rates to foster inclusive education. Our research addresses the demand for data-driven approaches in education, offering an innovative method for predicting student performance and enhancing educational outcomes for diverse students. FeatureX and the CWFVC Algorithm provide valuable tools for educators and administrators to optimize resources, tailor support services, and create a more inclusive learning environment. Leveraging EDM and performance forecasting, educational institutions can proactively support students and promote academic success, contributing to an equitable and effective educational system.},

 abstract = {This study uses self-determination theory to examine the effect of gamification on the students' behavioral, emotional, and cognitive engagement in online discussion forums by providing more instructor badges than automatic badges and using a quasi-experimental one-group pretest-posttest design. Behavioral engagement was measured using the number of posts and replies; emotional engagement was measured using perceived relatedness; and cogitative engagement was measured by the quality of the post/reply's content. Sixty participants used the developed online discussion website and held two 3-day discussion sessions (non-gamified and gamified) with different topics. The data were collected using user logs (number of posts and replies), questionnaire responses (perceived relatedness), and assessment rubrics (scores on the post/reply content), analyzed using the one-way repeated measures analysis of variance. The results revealed that gamification affected emotional engagement, which was influenced by the "like" feature, which made it easier for participants to appreciate others' activities. However, this feature also decreased the number of replies (behavioral engagement) because the students perceived "liking" as an easier way to appreciate other posts/replies instead of writing a reply. The number of posts also decreased since participants' motivation in the second session tended to focus on the quality of the content caused by the badge list page, which guides the expected best content from the participant. This study can provide guidance to universities in implementing gamification in LMS.},

The goal of this research is to examine factors that influence students' academic performance as well as their level of participation in blended learning environments. A comprehensive study was conducted with 330 interested participants from the prestigious government polytechnics of the state of Karnataka in order to achieve this goal. Our data acquisition approach relied on the administration of a meticulously crafted survey questionnaire. The conceptual framework underpinning this study seamlessly integrates Transactional Distance Theory (TDT) principles with valuable insights derived from prior research. The Welch test and one-way ANOVA (Analysis of Variance) are two statistical approaches that we used selectively to reinforce our research which produced surprising results. These findings underscore the pivotal role played by certain specific factors. The geographical location of learners and the medium through which they pursue their studies have emerged as critical determinants significantly influencing academic performance. Aspects like the frequency of login activities and active engagement in forum discussions have been found to exert a positive influence on learners' academic performance. In contrast, the duration of sleep did not show a significant impact on performance. These insights bear tangible implications for teachers and policymakers who are dedicated to the enhancement of the quality of BL programs with the ultimate goal of enriching the overall educational experience.},

 abstract = {In higher education, academic advising is crucial to students' decision-making. Data-driven models can benefit students in making informed decisions by providing insightful recommendations for completing their degrees. To suggest courses for the upcoming semester, various course recommendation models have been proposed in the literature using different data mining techniques and machine learning algorithms utilizing different data types. One important aspect of the data is that usually, courses taken together in a semester fit well with each other. If there is no correlation between the co-taken courses, students may find it more difficult to handle the workload. Based on this insight, we propose using session-based approaches to recommend a set of well-suited courses for the upcoming semester. We test three session-based course recommendation models, two based on neural networks (CourseBEACON and CourseDREAM) and one on tensor factorization (TF-CoC). Additionally, we propose a post-processing approach to adjust the recommendation scores of any base course recommender to promote related courses. Using metrics capturing different aspects of the recommendation quality, our experimental evaluation shows that session-based methods outperform existing popularity-based, association-based, similarity-based, factorization-based, neural networks-based, and Markov chain-based recommendation approaches. Effective course recommendations can result in improved student advising, which, in turn, can improve student performance, decrease dropout rates, and a more positive overall student experience and satisfaction.},

 abstract = {Educational institutions and users involved in the whole learning process frequently have concerns about the storage and processing of sensitive data and essential apps in the cloud. Security and privacy issues have emerged as a major challenge, limiting cloud computing’s implementation in educational environments. Several users have yet to meet this security challenge, which is linked to the system’s multi-tenancy nature and the outsourcing of resources and data. This study proposes a secure framework for protecting cloud-based educational systems from hacking using a unique encryption technique, as well as a deep learning-based classification for cloud attack detection. Initially, we preprocess the data and extract features using a gray-level covariance matrix (GLCM). Next, we propose a classification based on multiple convolutional neural networks (M−CNN) to detect attacks in the cloud environment. Finally, we propose a modified digital signature algorithm (MDSA) for data encryption and decryption. The proposed technique achieved high security rates, with an accuracy of 97.7%, sensitivity of 96%, specificity of 94.3%, precision of 99.6%, and recall of 97%. Comparative evaluations showed that the proposed mechanism outperformed other encryption techniques. This novel model enhances the security of cloud-based educational systems and promotes users’ confidence in such platforms.},

 abstract = {Simply placing learners in computer-supported collaborative learning environments cannot result in successful collaborative learning. To investigate how collaborative learning happens through online communication, studying learners' interactions is of crucial importance. Accordingly, the present quantitative ethnographic study used an epistemic network analysis (ENA) approach to investigate social and cognitive presence in students' interactions based on the community of inquiry (CoI) framework. To do so, students’ interactions via an online annotation tool called Nowcomment in a computer-assisted language learning course (CALL) were collected and examined. The data was coded based on the social presence indicators and cognitive presence phases of CoI. ENA was used to visualize the relationships between social indicators and cognitive phases for all the students, for high and low score students, and at the beginning and end of the course. The results indicated that among social presence indicators, the affective category had the weakest, and the interactive had the strongest relationships with cognitive phases, especially exploration, and integration. There were connections between social indicators and cognitive phases of, triggering and exploration for high score students, and exploration and integration for low scores. Additionally, the present study did not show any improvement toward resolution, the last phase of cognitive development.},

The study aimed to characterize learners according to their learning patterns and to identify indicators that predict students' success in an online environment. Specifically, we focused on the role of a central factor affecting success in online courses: self-regulated learning and learner engagement. To this end, we used a mixed methods approach that combines semi-structured interviews and statistical analysis. We applied two logistic regression models and a decision tree algorithm and found two parameters that can predict completion of the course: the submission status of an optional assignment and the students' cumulative video opening pattern (SCOP). Recommendations for institutions and lecturers regarding the benefits of implementing these models to identify self-regulated learning patterns in online courses and to design future effective interventions are discussed. Regarding students, we emphasize the importance of time management and how choices they make with respect to their learning process affect their potential for success.},

 abstract = {This review discusses Moodle quizzes and their potential usefulness for formative assessment of academic writing. Moodle quizzes offer a wide variety of possibilities for the development of formative writing assessment. This is due to the impressive repertoire of choices with regard to specific tasks and to quiz design options available in Moodle. The key strength of Moodle quizzes, as used for formative assessment, is in supporting a sustained engagement with learning and offering multi-layered tutor feedback functionalities. However, Moodle quizzes come short of accommodating some of the essential features of formative writing assessment, such as peer review/feedback and a dialogic nature of student-tutor interactions. While the development of Moodle quizzes may require time and effort, in particular as related to navigating quiz design settings and understanding Moodle-specific and often counterintuitive language use, Moodle quizzes can prove valuable not only for formative assessment of academic writing, but also for giving reassurance to students that writing provision offered to them at universities is tailored to their specific needs and academic aspirations.},

This quantitative study analyzed four years of institutional data cumulating in 72,441 course enrollments of 23,610 students in 433 courses during summer terms at a large public research university. Multi-level logistic regression models indicated that characteristics including gender, in-state residency, admission test scores, previous online course enrollment, and course size, among others, can influence student enrollment by course modality. Multi-way fixed effects linear regression models indicated that student grades were slightly lower in online courses compared to face-to-face courses.

However, previous studies did not distinguish between the different learning modes of the four-stage experiential learning cycle (i.e., concrete experience, reflective observation, abstract conceptualization, and active experimentation). With our study, we contribute a deeper understanding of how the unique opportunities of virtual reality can afford each of the four experiential learning modes. We conducted three design thinking workshops with interdisciplinary teams of students and lecturers. These workshops resulted in three low-fidelity virtual reality prototypes which were evaluated and refined in three student focus groups. Based on these results, we identify design elements for virtual reality applications that afford an holistic experiential learning process in higher education. We discuss the implications of our results for the selection, design, and use of educational virtual reality applications.},

 abstract = {Text-based open-ended questions in academic formative and summative assessments help students become deep learners and prepare them to understand concepts for a subsequent conceptual assessment. However, grading text-based questions, especially in large (>50 enrolled students) courses, is tedious and time-consuming for instructors. Text processing models continue progressing with the rapid development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools and Natural Language Processing (NLP) algorithms. Especially after breakthroughs in Large Language Models (LLM), there is immense potential to automate rapid assessment and feedback of text-based responses in education. This systematic review adopts a scientific and reproducible literature search strategy based on the PRISMA process using explicit inclusion and exclusion criteria to study text-based automatic assessment systems in post-secondary education, screening 838 papers and synthesizing 93 studies. To understand how text-based automatic assessment systems have been developed and applied in education in recent years, three research questions are considered: 1) What types of automated assessment systems can be identified using input, output, and processing framework? 2) What are the educational focus and research motivations of studies with automated assessment systems? 3) What are the reported research outcomes in automated assessment systems and the next steps for educational applications? All included studies are summarized and categorized according to a proposed comprehensive framework, including the input and output of the system, research motivation, and research outcomes, aiming to answer the research questions accordingly. Additionally, the typical studies of automated assessment systems, research methods, and application domains in these studies are investigated and summarized. This systematic review provides an overview of recent educational applications of text-based assessment systems for understanding the latest AI/NLP developments assisting in text-based assessments in higher education. Findings will particularly benefit researchers and educators incorporating LLMs such as ChatGPT into their educational activities.},

 abstract = {The traditional education model is undergoing tremendous changes, and network education has gradually developed and matured. This paper first gives an overview of the development history of the clarinet and the structure of the clarinet and then starts with the performance of the clarinet. This paper analyses and solves the situations that students are prone to encounter in teaching and expresses some opinions on the teaching of performance methods; also gives a brief overview of the psychology of going on stage. Combined with the above, some discussions are made on the teaching of performance methods. Performance requires not only skills but also music. Performance summarizes the characteristics and styles of music in various periods from the classical period to the century, and then discusses how the performer forms his performance style; the performance style is the re-creation and re-creation of the performer based on being loyal to the author's intention. This article compares and studies the performance of the clarinet before the 20th century and the performance of the clarinet today, and deeply explores the reasons why the clarinet performance method has formed the current performance method after a long evolution. The experimental results prove that virtual reality technology has made positive attempts and breakthroughs in the field of clarinet music art teaching. It has created an environment of “self-learning”, and the traditional learning method of “teaching to promote learning” has been replaced by learners through their learning. Interaction with the information environment to obtain a new learning method of knowledge and skills, the optimized local matrix decomposition recommendation algorithm can greatly improve problems such as expensive musical instruments and lessons, scarce teachers, and lack of facilities, making the traditional clarinet Music arts teaching more diverse.},

This paper describes the effect of the FT methodology on the students' academic performance when it was applied to the laboratory practice in two subjects, Physics and Electricity, of a technical degree. The laboratory and final grades of these subjects were compared in four consecutive years. The characteristics of all four years were quite similar, except that the traditional teaching method (TM) was used in two, while FT was applied in the other two. The statistical analysis shows that the academic results of the students were better in both subjects under FT than those obtained using TM, and that the difference was statistically significant.},

Moreover, this work evaluates the use of this tool to support decision-making of actual advisers in two different higher education institutions (University A, University B), compared with more traditional procedures and tools. Results indicate that LADA enables expert advisers to evaluate significantly more scenarios (Median = 2), especially for high advising difficulty cases with students that failed many courses (MedianA=3,MedianB=2.5), in a not-significantly different amount of time. For inexperienced advisers, LADA is perceived as a valuable tool for more accurate and efficient decision-making, as they were able to make informed decisions in a similar amount of time compared to the experts. These results are encouraging for further developments in the field.},

Previous research uncovered a rich set of domain-specific and generic cognitive and metacognitive strategies students use when they learn to program. The processes that problem-solving experts demonstrate are very similar to those studied by self-regulated learning researchers. This study proposes Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) process types derived from the SRL phases indicators developed from log data captured from students' interaction with the instructional scaffold for programming assignments in LMS. The process types were defined from theoretical and pragmatic perspectives, with the aim to indicate concrete interventions for improving problemsolving skills. We have observed and quantified students' use of the SRL processes of distinct types in the series of five problem-solving assignments. We have also observed the progression of SRL processes used by each student in the assignments. Our modelling showed that students with domain knowledge at the same level achieve higher assignment marks when they demonstrate SRL processes at the higher level; importantly, students with the lowest programming skills benefit the most.},

 abstract = {The growing popularity of e-learning platforms, such as learning management systems, has foregrounded the role of self-regulated learning (SRL) in student success. In many e-learning environments, students typically complete learning assignments outside of school hours with little or no instructor support, which requires students to be highly self-regulated. The current study used trace data from a Moodle platform to examine both the temporal pattern of students' SRL behaviors and changes in high- and low-performing students' SRL behaviors following a formative in-course exam. This study employed repeated-measures ANOVA, multivariate ANOVA, Fuzzy miner, and pMineR on 122,167 event logs from 527 undergraduate students. Findings revealed that students engaged in a loosely sequenced recursive SRL cycle. Following the formative assessment, each group made different adjustments to their SRL processes. High-performing students exhibited more SRL behaviors and developed more structured and interconnected SRL patterns. Low-performing students displayed a smaller increase in SRL behaviors while maintaining their established SRL patterns. Findings from this study could provide a more in-depth theoretical understanding of the nature of SRL cycles. Furthermore, students’ adjustment of SRL patterns in response to assessment may be informative for practitioners to assist students in enhancing their SRL through formative feedback.},

Specifically, the application aims at tracking and reducing learners’ misconceptions and easing teachers’ corrections of homework. To achieve this goal, the proposed software uses text processing, collaborative filtering, and teacher collaboration in a wiki-like environment. While the software has not been implemented as a whole, its main components have been implemented and evaluated in several case studies. These studies point to the realizability and effectiveness of the approach.},

 abstract = {Research on the relationship between the digital traces of students in Learning Management Systems (LMS) and their academic performance has traditionally been an area of interest in the field of learning analytics. Aiming at achieving high interpretability and generalizability, this study reviews past research, defines a new categorization scheme for interactions in LMS and investigates the relationships between clickstream data of students’ activity and course performance, measured as final grade. The results of the multiple regression analysis of Moodle log data collected from three courses of diverse nature using various classifications of interactions suggest that the new categorization, the CILC (Classification of Interactions based on the Learning Cycle), improves the explanatory power when compared to previous classifications. The analysis suggests that the predictive ability of the models could depend on the delivery mode, with predictions improving as the delivery mode transitions from face-to-face learning to online learning. This finding highlights the need for context-specific considerations about the learning process. Compared to previous research, the analysis also reveals nuances that suggest that the relationships may depend on the instructional design. Finally, the findings also seem to support the notion that increased data quantity and quality may improve predictive models. In summary, the study contributes with valuable insights into the interplay between LMS interactions, course delivery mode, instructional design, and academic performance, and advocates for a balanced exploration of white-box and black-box modeling approaches in learning analytics research.},

Whilst they provided substantial insights, most of these studies have been implemented in single-course or small-scale settings. There are only a few studies that are large-scale and institutional-wide adaptations of LA and have explored the stakeholders' perspectives (i.e., teachers, students, researchers, management) and involvement with LA. This study reports on one such large-scale and long-term implementation of Predictive Learning Analytics (PLA) spanning a period of 4 years at a distance learning university. OU Analyse (OUA) is the PLA system used in this study, providing predictive insights to teachers about students and their chance of passing a course. Over the last 4 years, OUA has been accessed by 1159 unique teachers and reached 23,180 students in 231 undergraduate online courses. The aim of this study is twofold: (a) to reflect on the macro-level of adoption by detailing usage, challenges, and factors facilitating adoption at an organisational level, and (b) to detail the micro-level of adoption, that is the teachers' perspectives about OUA. Amongst the factors shown to be critical to the scalable PLA implementation were: Faculty's engagement with OUA, teachers as “champions”, evidence generation and dissemination, digital literacy, and conceptions about teaching online.},

We aimed to identify (a) factors that explain the degree of using PLA in the teaching practice and (b) the impact of an intervention - sending email reminders to teachers - on facilitating systematic engagement with PLA. Findings suggested that, amongst the factors facilitating engagement with PLA were performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and social influence. Amongst the factors inhibiting engagement with PLA were performance expectancy and facilitated conditions that were related to training and a lack of understanding of predictive data. Implications for the adoption and use of PLA in higher education are discussed.},

Introducing it in secondary schools is challenging due to potential cognitive overload and the complexity of the skills required. This study evaluates the effectiveness of a Learning Management System (LMS) using Cognitive Load Theory for improving entrepreneurial skills among secondary students in Hong Kong. In the study, 280 students from 16 schools completed the LMS intervention. Through a series of t-tests, ANCOVAs, and multilevel models, we examined the effects of an LMS on students' entrepreneurial attributes and aspirations. The results indicated that the LMS enhances students' perceptions of entrepreneurial concepts. However, the effectiveness of the LMS was influenced by two key factors: the level of student engagement with the system and their previous entrepreneurial experiences. Higher engagement with the LMS and more extensive prior entrepreneurial experiences were found to significantly boost students' entrepreneurial attributes and aspirations. The outcomes indicate that by organizing content to minimize cognitive overload, the LMS facilitated the development of sophisticated cognitive schemas essential for entrepreneurial thinking.},

To cater to the diverse abilities of students, this paper explored the use of flipped learning as a teaching approach in an introductory economics course. We investigated the effectiveness of 40 pre-lecture videos covering basic concepts and 27 post-lecture tutorial videos focusing on practice in improving students' exam outcomes, especially for beginners in economics who may require more support from instructors than other students. We collected data about video engagement and students' grades in progress assessments. Surveys were conducted to gather students’ feedback regarding the usefulness of the videos on their learning. The findings showed that beginners engaged more with those videos, spent more time watching them compared to non-beginners. Furthermore, the study observed an improvement in beginners' exam performance, with their average grade increasing as a percentage of the average of non-beginners. These findings hold significance for instructors aiming to offer personalized assistance to students with varying levels of prior knowledge, thereby advancing educational practices in the field of economics.},

 abstract = {The open learner model (OLM) represents the knowledge or skill levels of learners in various ways, encouraging learners to actively participate in thinking about and crafting their own learning. Despite the important roles that OLMs play in higher education to support the learning process and self-regulated learning (SRL) in particular, there are few studies systematically reviewing OLM technology in higher education, and investigating their potential to foster self-regulated learning. Therefore, we carried out a systematic review of a 30-year sample of OLM studies in higher education and identified 64 articles that study the use of OLMs in supporting SRL. Our findings show that OLMs have been mainly used to support learners' cognition and a bit less metacognition and motivation; however, emotional support has been rarely provided. The most supported ones are Appraisal and Performance phases; Preparation of learning is enhanced by OLMs not so often. Although learners can edit or negotiate with their learning model in advanced ways, a simple inspectable OLM is more preferred. Reliance on unobservable nodes is less favored in modeling techniques in OLMs because such methods are highly dependent on expert authoring, thereby time-intensive and costly. Comparison and color-coding are two most-used features in OLMs, where the comparison feature is often used for enhancing learners’ engagement and motivation.},

 abstract = {Purpose
This study explores collaborative technology's effectiveness in facilitating learning in a hybrid (synchronous face-to-face and asynchronous virtual) context. In particular, the study explores the critical role of students' feeling-at-ease, including its drivers and impact on their perception of the technology.
Design/methodology/approach
The study included a classroom intervention in which a collaborative technology, i.e. VoiceThread, was implemented in a hybrid learning context. Online surveys, which included quantitative and qualitative components, were administered at the start and end of the semester to capture student perceptions and experiences with the technology.
Findings
Students who felt more at ease assessed the collaborative technology more positively. While extraversion was marginally associated with initial feeling at ease, technology anxiety was not. When using the technology to post content, students who felt more at ease preferred using audio or video over text. Students' perception of the importance of technology in facilitating their learning was a key mediator in the relationship between feeling less at ease and future intention to use the collaborative technology.
Originality/value
The paper investigates the implementation of a collaborative technology in a hybrid learning context, highlighting the critical role of feeling at ease in impacting its acceptance.},

In response, educational institutions have rapidly expanded their virtual course offerings and assessment methods. One significant challenge in the realm of online education is the effective assessment of student involvement, engagement, and attentiveness during virtual classes. To address this challenge, we introduce a specialized system tailored to identifying and comprehending the complex range of student behaviors exhibited during online classes. Our system takes into account the diverse contexts and individual considerations that shape students' responses to the online learning environment. It employs user authentication through facial recognition technology and seamlessly integrates vital components, including facial detection, hand tracking, mobile phone detection, and pose estimation modules. Leveraging these components, we extract high-level features to construct a comprehensive dataset for training machine-learning models designed to detect students' attention levels during online classes. After evaluating six prominent machine learning algorithms, we have selected the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithm, which demonstrated an impressive 99.75% accuracy on the test data. Finally, the system generates a comprehensive anonymous report on the level of attentiveness of students, accessible through a dedicated webpage that includes a summary of the behavior of students throughout online classes, providing valuable insights for personalized interventions and enhanced online learning experiences.},

 abstract = {Cognitive diagnostics is a pivotal area within educational data mining, focusing on deciphering students’ cognitive status via their academic performance. Traditionally, cognitive diagnostic models (CDMs) have evolved from manually designed probabilistic graphical models to sophisticated automated learning models employing neural networks. Despite their enhanced fitting capabilities, contemporary neuro-cognitive diagnostic models frequently overlook critical process information from students and suffer from reduced interpretability. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a neuro-cognitive diagnostic model that integrates multidimensional features (MFNCD) by incorporating students’ response time as process information. This approach facilitates the simultaneous modeling of students’ response accuracy and response speed using neural networks, thereby enhancing both the fitting capability and precision of the method. Furthermore, a multi-channel attention mechanism is employed to effectively capture the complex interactions between students and exercise characteristics, simulating the process of students answering questions and thereby improving the model's interpretability. Validated on four diverse datasets, MFNCD model demonstrates superior accuracy compared to other state-of-the-art (SOAT) baseline models. Additionally, our experiments confirm significant correlations between cognitive attributes, revealing interesting educational patterns, such as a positive correlation between speed and ability, and between ability and accuracy. These findings provide deeper insights into learning patterns that incorporate multidimensional features and suggest potential pathways for targeted educational interventions.},

It was hypothesized that participants would judge less well-established items more slowly, and conversely that entrenched items, whether target-like or not, would be judged more quickly. 20 learners at two proficiency levels judged audio recordings of themselves reformulating errors they had made in small-group conversations. Items had been categorized according to reformulation accuracy and fluency, and the analysis investigated whether judgment accuracy and speed mirrored these categories. Results indicate clear parallels in reformulation and judgment accuracy, but a weak relationship between fluency of production and recognition. The categorization of errors occurring in both production and recognition, perhaps representing “attempts” at meaning-making (Edge, 1989; Willis, 2003), is proposed as the focus of future pedagogical research investigation.

Results indicate that student performance is enhanced by the number of completed adaptive assignments, which captures learner-content interaction and adaptive learning. However, the amount of time spent studying was negatively associated with performance.

The results of an experiment on 80 students with different personality types are presented. The analysis of the results showed that the emotional state of the students, who used the developed decision support system in teaching, became much better. After training, the level of knowledge of students, who used the developed decision support system, became higher.},

 abstract = {As society and technology advance to meet Industry 4.0 requirements, the educational system has also undergone many transformative changes in the past decade. Education is regarded as one of the most important tools for developing individuals, families, businesses, and the economy. New digital technologies are making a great revolution by transforming all aspects of education in teaching, learning, assessment, and feedback. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to the proliferation of digital education and its replacement of traditional education in the educational system. The developments in artificial intelligence (AI) are indispensable in all sectors, including education. AI-integrated learning helps management, teachers, students, parents, and other stakeholders gain insight into their performance to impact the process positively. This chapter aims to throw light on the emerging need and technologies used for digital education and to examine the role of AI in education with examples from the perspectives of teaching, learning, and assessment in the new normal. The application of AI in education and its effectiveness is explored through six publicly available datasets along with strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, challenges, and the future of digital education. This chapter discusses several examples and benefits of AI applications that enhance the educational experience and also emphasizes the need to align it with technology and curriculum to achieve the intended learning outcomes.},

 abstract = {Learners in computer- or mobile-assisted collaborative learning environments could remain anonymous or unfamiliar, as educators might not provide explicit socializing activities with the assumption that effective interactions could happen naturally in these situations. However, from the perspectives of social presence, it was hypothesized that for learners who were unfamiliar to their peers in online collaborative learning environments, performing explicit socializing activities prior to learning phases would help them have better learning performance, experience lower levels of working memory load, and experience higher levels of social presence than performing implicit socializing activities. This research was conducted to test the hypotheses with 60 participants. The results showed that providing explicit socializing activities to unfamiliar learners in mobile-assisted collaborative learning environments increased the level of social presence, facilitated their acquisition of complex cognitive skills such as EFL argument essay writing skills, and reduced the level of cognitive load in learning. These results are discussed in light of human cognitive architecture and the social presence theory.},

Nevertheless, only a few studies have investigated the behavioral patterns of high-scoring (HS) and low-scoring (LS) students to facilitate predictions during peer assessment (PA). Therefore, we performed learning analytics to explore the behavioral patterns of HS and LS students in 52 university students from affective, cognitive, and metacognitive perspectives as these students engage in online PAs. The results indicated that on the affective dimension, HS students tended to exhibit negative affection while LS students tended to display positive affection. On the cognitive dimension, HS students demonstrated more intricate transformations compared to the LS students. Regarding the metacognitive dimension, LS students more likely reflected upon and accepted the reviews provided by others than the HS. Additionally, the findings also revealed that HS students were supported by focused social networks and overall stable activity engagement, whereas the LS students were less engaged at the beginning of the activity but had evolving social networks and were more engaged in the later stages of the activity. These findings offer valuable insights for educators in effectively predicting student performance based on behavioral patterns while providing new perspectives to support instructional decision-making processes.},

In this study, a design-based research (DBR) approach was used to develop teacher-facilitated tactics for SVVR-supported learning based on virtual inquiry fieldwork in formal senior secondary geography education in Hong Kong. Over a period of 2 academic years, we engaged with nine teachers (from nine schools across the upper, middle, and lower academic bands in Hong Kong) and their Grade-10 classes, which comprised a total of 504 students. In addition to reporting and discussing the pedagogical effectiveness of the teacher facilitation practices designed, enacted, analysed, and refined in the iterative DBR process, this paper presents the teacher facilitation principles deduced from these practices. Overall, the findings and implications of this DBR are academically and practically relevant for researchers and educational practitioners who seek to utilise SVVR for educational purposes and strive to enhance its pedagogical effectiveness.},

 abstract = {Predictive modelling of academic success and retention has been a key research theme in Learning Analytics. While the initial work on predictive modelling was focused on the development of general predictive models, portable across different learning settings, later studies demonstrated the drawbacks of not considering the specificities of course design and disciplinary context. This study builds on the methods and findings of related earlier studies to further explore factors predictive of learners' academic success in blended learning. In doing so, it differentiates itself by (i) relying on a larger and homogeneous course sample (15 courses, 50 course offerings in total), and (ii) considering both internal and external conditions as factors affecting the learning process. We apply mixed effect linear regression models, to examine: i) to what extent indicators of students' online learning behaviour can explain the variability in the final grades, and ii) to what extent that variability is attributable to the course and students' internal conditions, not captured by the logged data. Having examined different types of behaviour indicators (e.g., indicators of the overall activity level, those indicative of regularity of study, etc), we found little difference, if any, in their predictive power. Our results further indicate that a low proportion of variance is explained by the behaviour-based indicators, while a significant portion of variability stems from the learners' internal conditions. Hence, when variability in external conditions is largely controlled for (the same institution, discipline, and nominal pedagogical model), students’ internal state is the key predictor of their course performance.},

Yet, even though these contemporary learning systems are useful educational platforms that meet students’ needs, there is still a low number of implemented systems designed to address the concerns and problems faced by many students. Based on this perspective, a systematic mapping of the literature on AI-enabled adaptive learning systems was performed in this work. A total of 147 studies published between 2014 and 2020 were analysed. The major findings and contributions of this paper include the identification of the types of AI-enabled learning interventions used, a visualisation of the co-occurrences of authors associated with major research themes in AI-enabled learning systems and a review of common analytical methods and related techniques utilised in such learning systems. This mapping can serve as a guide for future studies on how to better design AI-enabled learning systems to solve specific learning problems and improve users’ learning experiences.},

To identify the main characteristics of SLA, gaps and future opportunities for this emerging approach, we systematically identified and analyzed 36 SLA-related studies conducted between 2011 and 2020. We focus on SLA implementation and methodological characteristics, educational focus, and the studies’ theoretical perspectives. The results show the predominance of SLA in formal and fully online settings with social network analysis (SNA) a dominant analytical technique. Most SLA studies aimed to understand students’ learning processes and applied the social constructivist perspective as a lens to interpret students’ learning behaviors. However, (i) few studies involve teachers in developing SLA tools, and rarely share SLA visualizations with teachers to support teaching decisions; (ii) some SLA studies are atheoretical; and (iii) the number of SLA studies integrating more than one analytical approach remains limited. Moreover, (iv) few studies leveraged innovative network approaches (e.g., epistemic network analysis, multimodal network analysis), and (v) studies rarely focused on temporal patterns of students’ interactions to assess how students’ social and knowledge networks evolve over time. Based on the findings and the gaps identified, we present methodological, theoretical and practical recommendations for conducting research and creating tools that can advance the field of SLA.},

The findings demonstrated that the experience of LS-oriented, digitallymediated writing instruction facilitated the writing teachers’ firsthand exploration of digital spaces and promoted their digitallymediated teaching competence through peer reflection, team coaching, and project-based practices. Additionally, the experience enhanced their pedagogical flexibility, confidence, and autonomy for adapting writing instruction to virtual platforms, assisted them in developing technology-mediated writing lesson plan, task design, and assessment rubric, engaged them in a small community of L2 writing teachers as digital materials co-producers, and helped them use digital tools to meet learners’ context-specific writing needs.

 abstract = {There is a huge and growing amount of data that is already captured in the many, diverse digital tools that support learning. Additionally, learning data is often inaccessible to teachers or served in a manner that fails to support or inform their teaching and design practice. We need systematic, learner-centred ways for teachers to design learning data that supports them. Drawing on decades of Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED) research, we show how to make use of important AIED concepts: (1) learner models; (2) Open Learner Models (OLMs); (3) scrutability and (4) Ontologies. We show how these concepts can be used in the design of OLMs, interfaces that enable a learner to see and interact with an externalised representation of their learning progress. We extend this important work by demonstrating how OLMs can also drive a learner-centred design process of learning data. We draw on the work of Biggs on constructive alignment (Biggs, 1996, 1999, 2011), which has been so influential in education. Like Biggs, we propose a way for teachers to design the learning data in their subjects and we illustrate the approach with case studies. We show how teachers can use this approach today, essentially integrating the design of learning data along with the learning design for their subjects. We outline a research agenda for designing the collection of richer learning data. There are three core contributions of this paper. First, we present the terms OLM, learner model, scrutability and ontologies, as thinking tools for systematic design of learning data. Second, we show how to integrate this into the design and refinement of a subject. Finally, we present a research agenda for making this process both easier and more powerful.},

The results showed that high achievers' attitudes towards programming positively related to their flow experience, which further positively associated with their programming intentions. In addition, teacher support moderated the relationship between high achievers’ attitudes and their flow experience; such that when teacher support increased, the flow experience was weaker for those with comparatively higher positive attitudes.

However, little is known about how individual differences in motivational factors, such as achievement goals, relate to how students learn within multimedia environments that include instructional videos and generative strategies. Therefore, in this study, we explored how achievement goals predicted undergraduate students’ behaviors when learning with instructional videos that required students to answer practice questions between videos, as well as how those activities predicted subsequent unit exam performance one week later. Additionally, we tested the best measurement models for modeling achievement goals between traditional confirmatory factor analysis and bifactor confirmatory factor analysis. The bifactor model fit our data best and was used for all subsequent analyses. Results indicated that stronger mastery goal endorsement predicted performance on the practice questions in the multimedia learning environment, which in turn positively predicted unit exam performance. In addition, students’ time spent watching videos positively predicted practice question performance. Taken together, this research emphasizes the availing role of adaptive motivations, like mastery goals, in learning from instructional videos that prompt the use of generative learning strategies.},

 abstract = {The Faculty of Mechanical Engineering, Czech Technical University in Prague (FME) faces a significant student drop-out in the first-year bachelor programme, which is an actual problem for many higher education institutions. Metacognitive processes play a vital role in self-regulated learning. Students become active participants in their learning, and one critical aspect of higher education studies is planning and time management. The exam taking behaviour is in the context of the FME manifestation of the time management skills of each student; thus, the exam-taking patterns may help identify at-risk students. To evaluate the importance of exam behaviour patterns, we conducted three experiments. Identification of students passing or failing the first study year has been conducted using four different machine learning models. The exam taking behaviour patterns increase the prediction F-measure significantly for the class of failing students (approximately 0.3 increase). Moreover, the approach based on student behaviour enabled us to identify the critical exam-taking patterns, which further helps the lecturers identify at-risk students and improve their time management skills and chances to pass the first academic year.},

 abstract = {In recent years, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has been a leader in the global adoption of AI and online schooling. Despite using the traditional educational structure, military colleges have embraced this new technology. This research analyzed the present adoption rate, difficulties, and solutions for implementing an AI-based online education system. The results demonstrate that digital technology has a tangible impact on all facets of higher education if it is supported by the institution. The results also indicate that the organization plays a crucial role in the integration of digital technology into teaching and learning, and that an examination of the materiality already present in the Collaborative Technical Education (CTE) organization is necessary for comprehending the potential effects of new digital technology. Finally, this paper addressed how AI can make e-learning more interesting, efficient, and tailored to each individual learner, all of which contribute to better learning outcomes and wider access to technical education. The details of how artificial intelligence can be used to promote diversity and equity in the classroom are laid out. To motivate educators to create mixed-reality artifacts and conduct further research to support collaborative educational environments, this article discusses current works and visualizes the current state of the field.},

 abstract = {Current data sources used for the prediction of student outcomes average about 55% accuracy and require a significant amount of input data and time for researchers and educators to produce predictive models of student outcomes. The aim of this study is to examine how neurocognitive data collected via functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) may be used to create predictive models of student outcomes with greater speed and accuracy when using a synthetic adaptive learning environment (SALEs). Specifically, this study examines the utility of using neurocognitive data to develop student response prediction on a science content test. Participants were recruited from schools located in the United States (n = 40). Participants in the study engaged in three conditions: no content, video and virtual reality. The lesson video and virtual reality lesson provides an explanation of deoxyribonucleic acid replication. Observed neurocognitive responses were collected during each condition and used to predict the success of student responses on an assessment. On average the predicative accuracy of this approach is 85% and occur within 300 ms. Predictive error rates are less than 15%. Results of this study provides evidence to support the use of neurocognitive data for adaption of digitally presented content and how machine learning approaches and artificial intelligence may be used to classify student data in real-time as students engage with content. Results also illustrate good accuracy and capture of moment-to- moment fluctuations of cognition in real-time. These findings may help the development of artificially intelligent tutors and improve student-based learning analytics.},

The study leveraged data and text mining techniques to examine five years of online discussion data automatically collected by a Learning Management System from 72 introductory online mathematics courses involving over 2800 instructors and students who collectively contributed over 22,000 posts. A classification and regression tree (CART) analysis of instructor strategies revealed four instructor participation variables (open-ended discussion, grading, discussion setting, elaborated feedback) that impacted student course performance and nine that did not. Further, students in courses where instructors used open-ended discussion prompts and graded posts had higher average final course grades. An examination of how instructor discussion strategies influenced student participation found that subgroups of students with lower average final course grades tended to engage in less online speaking and listening, while also contributing more posts categorized as social interactions and fewer related to course content. Students in subgroups with higher average final course grades tended to engage in more online listening and contributed more posts coded as higher in knowledge construction.},

SQL and relational databases are traditional topics in many AIS classes and are frequently taught with established technologies such as Microsoft Access. With the onset of newer data analytics tools, educators are faced with the challenge of incorporating emerging technologies while still covering basic foundational concepts. In this paper, we position SQL as the mental model for learning the data preparation and data blending features of a popular analytics tool, Alteryx. We split the traditional SQL content from our course into four increments that increase in complexity. For each increment, we use a multi-step approach to first develop students’ mental model of the SQL query code and then apply the mental model to the new environment of Alteryx. For each increment, students solve the same set of problems in SQL and Alteryx, so that the understanding of SQL eases the transition to Alteryx, and the practice in Alteryx reinforces the understanding of SQL.},

 abstract = {The current study examines both student self-regulated learning (SRL) and teacher orchestration in a virtual learning environment (VLE), with respect to student achievement. The study used SRL indicators derived from the log data on how students used the VLE system, survey data on how teachers made use of the VLE for Algebra instruction, as well as formative and summative Algebra assessment scores. The sample included 6,174 students being taught by 93 teachers in 49 schools in the 2018–2019 academic year. Multilevel structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis revealed the relationship between SRL indicators and student achievement. We found a positive relationship between student SRL and student achievements. Specifically, three SRL indicators, “Watched Recommended Videos”, “Watched Videos” and “Answered Quizzes after Watching a Video”, were significantly associated with student achievement. We did not observe direct associations between teacher orchestration and student achievement, but we found an indirect association between teacher orchestration and student achievement via one SRL indicator, “Watched Recommended Videos”. The results show that a positive relationship between EOC scores and student reviewing incorrect questions increased as the use of instructional videos by the teacher increased. This study supports the critical role of SRL and indicates that teachers should have flexibility in adapting learning activities for online learning.},

 abstract = {Educational data mining and learning analytics, although experiencing an upsurge in exploration and use, continue to elude precise definition; the two terms are often interchangeably used. This could be owing to the fact that the two fields exhibit common thematic elements. One avenue to provide clarity, uniformity, and consistency around the two fields, is to identify similarities and differences in topics between the two evolving fields. This paper conducted a topic modeling analysis of articles related to educational data mining and learning analytics to reveal thematic features of the two fields. Specifically, we employed structural topic modeling to identify the topics of the two fields from the abstracts. We apply structural topic modeling on N=192 articles for educational data mining and N=489 articles for learning analytics. We infer five-topic models for both educational data mining and learning analytics. We find that while there appears to be disciplinary differences in terms of research focus, there is little support for a clear distinction between the two disciplines, beyond their different lineage. The trend points to a convergence within the field of educational research on the applications of advanced statistical learning techniques to extract actionable insights from large data streams for optimizing teaching and learning. Both fields have converged on an increasing focus on student behaviors over the last five years.},

Recent efforts have used clickstream data to create timely, fine-grained, and comprehensive measures of self-regulated learning (SRL) in online courses in an attempt to shed light on the process of SRL and to improve the identification of students who lack SRL skills and are at risk of low achievement. However, key questions remain: to what extent do these clickstream measures correspond to traditional self-reported measures about specific SRL constructs? Do these clickstream measures provide more information than existing self-reported measures in predicting course performance? This study used the clickstream data collected from a learning management system to measure two aspects of SRL: time management and effort regulation. We found that the clickstream measures were significantly associated with students' self-reported time management and effort regulation after the course. In addition, these clickstream measures significantly improved predictions of students' performance in the current and subsequent courses over predictions based on self-reported measures alone. These results provide evidence for the validity of the clickstream measures and guide the use of clickstream data to understand the process of SRL and identify students who might not be well served by taking classes online.},

To test the effect of the analytics and verify the proposed mechanism, we conducted an experiment in an online undergraduate course in which students were randomly assigned to receive theoretically inert questions (control condition), attribution questions (active control condition), and the analytics with attribution questions (treatment condition).

Previous research efforts have not sufficiently explored students perceptions around the commitment and adequacy of effort spent on software engineering projects, their project performance and skills that are developed during course projects. This gap in skills awareness includes those that are necessary, anticipated and learned, and the challenges to student project success, which may predict project performance. Such insights could inform curricula design, theory and practice, in terms of improving post-study software development success. We conducted a survey involving undergraduate across four universities in New Zealand and Cyprus to explore these issues, where extensive deductive and inductive analyses were performed. Among our findings we observe that students’ commitment of effort on software engineering project seems appropriate. Students are more satisfied with their team’s collaboration performance than technical contributions, but we found that junior students seemed to struggle with teamwork. Further, we observe that the software students developed were of higher quality if they had worked in project teams previously, had stronger technical skills and were involved in timely meetings. This study singles out mechanisms for informing good estimation of effort, mentoring technical competencies and suitable coaching for enhancing project success and student learning.},

 abstract = {The purpose of learning analytics is to promote student success in the classroom. To implement the framework of learning analytics, researchers have adopted machine learning methodologies to identify at-risk students at an early stage. In theory, machine learning is a mathematical algorithm that improves automation through experience. The experience is the data collected from online learning platforms, and in general, the data contain various features such as the number of times that a student accesses the learning material each week. Relevant studies have demonstrated extremely high accuracy in identifying at-risk students using identification models trained by machine learning. However, numerous details and data challenges have been overlooked in prior studies, calling into question the accuracy of past contributions. In this study, we focused on one type of data challenge: data imbalance. The data imbalance problems in education are usually the result of teachers’ grading policy. To highlight the seriousness of this issue, we collected data from 12 blended learning courses and summarized 3 types of grading policies: discrimination, stringency, and leniency. We then provided evidence that the leniency strategy causes the illusion of high accuracy of at-risk student identification. Finally, we verified a robust method to address the effectiveness of the leniency strategy, and using these results, we summarized the characteristics of students who tend to be misidentified by machine learning methodology.},

Based on 34 studies, 25 qualitative assessment methods have been identified and captured in a newly-developed typology. Results show that (1) the majority of qualitative methods to assess intercultural competence were writing-based and ‘expressive’ in nature; (2) the assessment results were mainly analysed in a ‘thematic’ or ‘scalar’ manner; and (3) very little assessment took place among STEM majors.

To improve quality assurance in the design of learning objects, this paper proposes systemically analyzing the user experience of new learning objects. This involves not only considering student feedback, but also integrating other perspectives into a continuous feedback loop, through a participatory design approach. The proposed framework was tested during the implementation of a flipped classroom initiative in a large Chilean university over a period of six months, involving 6 content designers, 3 teachers, 2 teaching assistants and 98 students. We observe how elements of feedback are integrated through a systemic assessment, where the end result (the learning object) is contrasted with the elements that guided its creation (the design guidelines). In this way, the roles of designer and user are complemented so as to identify design gaps early on in the process of creating a solution. This study adds to the current literature by relating design guidelines with the principles of instruction during the design process in order to ensure the overall quality of the learning objects.},

 abstract = {The impact of the fourth industrial revolution (4IR) has been experienced to varying degrees, with far-reaching implications in various domains, including economies, industries, education, transportation, and governance. Although there is consensus on the benefits and drawbacks of the fourth industrial revolution, the implications on the technical and vocational education and training (TVET) programme in South Africa are well documented. The study aimed to enhance knowledge in the field and added to the debates on the implications of 4IR on the TVET programme in South Africa. Through the Human Capital Theory (HCT) lens, the study sought to comprehend how to match the demands of 4IR with the TVET programme in South Africa. The study's objectives were to investigate the implications of the 4IR on the TVET programme and to determine how the TVET programme can appropriately prepare graduates in South Africa for the workplace. A constructivist paradigm sheltered the study through a qualitative approach and a phenomenological design. Purposive sampling was applied to select eight participants, comprising six TVET college lecturers, a TVET college placement manager, and a Department of Higher Education and Training (DHET) senior official. Semi-structured interviews were conducted to gain rich and meaningful responses from respondents. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, coded, themed, and analysed through thematic analysis with the aid of Atlas. Ti. The study's results reveal various implications for the TVET programme. Implications include updating TVET curricula and syllabi, promoting the TVET sector and labour industry collaboration, accepting 4IR technology as a learning tool, and increasing TVET lecturer capacity. The skills that were identified as essential for various industries in the 4IR era include creativity, computer skills, and problem-solving skills, which are cross-functional. These findings contribute to the theoretical knowledge of how the TVET programme can be positioned in the context of the 4IR. The study will assist stakeholders such as the labour market, quality assurance public entities, qualifications authorities, researchers, economic actors, and the TVET sector to sufficiently equip TVET graduates for the workplace in the 4IR era.},

 abstract = {Mastery assessments are used in many digital learning environments to control learning progression and support low-achieving students relearning important content. But research on personalized feedback following a mastery assessment is scarce and yielded ambiguous effects. Therefore, this study seeks to contribute to this area of research by investigating the effect of two different feedback messages in short online courses for German and English language grammar and spelling in secondary classrooms (grades 6–10). The study compares a reward-based feedback message to a self-referenced feedback message. The reward-based message indicates if the learner reaches the mastery criterion and how many points the learning app awarded for completing the test. The self-referenced feedback message applies motivation theory to strengthen students' internal attribution of causes for the test performance. The web-app MasteryX (www.masteryx.de) randomly assigned students to either the reward-based or the self-referenced feedback message. The study sampled 620 students (309 female, 311 male) in 53 classrooms from 27 secondary schools. It analyzed the effect of the two types of feedback messages on the level of test-retest-sequences (n = 2450). Results indicate small though significant positive effects of the self-referenced feedback message on subsequent learning behavior (reading elaborated item feedback, training behavior). However, a multilevel regression model showed small to medium effects of the reward-based feedback message on the higher course levels' follow-up mastery assessment score. The findings emphasize the complexity of designing personalized feedback strategies in online learning environments with mastery assessments.},

 abstract = {Digital learning technologies offer many opportunities to personalize instruction and learning in K-12 and higher education. In the last ten years, a growing body of research described personalized feedback implementations and investigated their effects on educational outcomes. Building on personalized education and adaptive learning systems models, this review provides an analytic framework to summarize key features of personalized feedback implementations and main empirical results. The systematic literature search resulted in 39 studies published in the last ten years. We found that scholars developed and investigated personalized feedback on the microscale, mesoscale, and macroscale of digital learning environments. However, the adaptive sources (To what is feedback adapted?) are mainly restricted to the current knowledge level and learning behavior data. Other interesting data sources for feedback adaptation remain underresearched, e.g., emotional state measures, progress measures, learning goals, or personality traits. Only a minority of the reviewed studies provided an empirical or theoretical rationale for assigning feedback messages to different types of students. Most studies report positive or at least mixed or neutral effects of personalized feedback on educational outcomes. This review discusses several implications for future directions in research on digitalized and personalized feedback. This study also adds to previous literature reviews on automatic and adaptive feedback that did not clearly distinguish task-adaptiveness and student-adaptiveness in digital feedback examples.},

 abstract = {Technology is ubiquitous in the modern world; to harness its educational potential in the quest to introduce environments that are flexible and differentiate for individual student learning needs, the strategic use of the complex array of tools is required. Engagement with this challenge has the potential to lead to the provision of interfaces that allow students to access these resources and become independent learners. It is therefore important to identify and evaluate the features of such interfaces to calibrate and respond to individual student needs. In this context, the quality of differentiated support for learning, referred to as scaffolding, is established as paramount to the design and structure of online environments. In this study, the instructional design referred to as predict, observe, explain and evaluate (POEE), informed by constructivist theories of learning, to implement multiple scaffolding strategies is described. The POEE scaffolding strategy was applied in the creation of two inquiry learning modules. Student engagement with these inquiry modules in a self-directed online environment was explored to identify critical elements of the scaffolding. The findings of this study, based on students' interactions and engagement with the learning modules, enabled the conceptualisation of a multimodal scaffolding strategy for self-directed inquiry. We propose that the recommendations from the implementation of these scaffolded learning modules can represent exemplars illustrative of an enriched instructional design paradigm to support students’ independent study in blended environments.},

 abstract = {The exponential growth of data in the field of education has created a pressing demand for a robust system capable of analyzing this vast amount of information, empowering decision-makers to enhance academic efficiency. By accurately identifying student eligibility for specific courses at the outset, a multitude of challenges, such as dropouts and poor performance, can be effectively mitigated or even prevented. This paper presents a Decision Support System (DSS) that leverages a hybrid data mining model to analyze educational data and unveil concealed patterns and rules. The DSS aims to support decision-makers in enhancing the operational effectiveness of academic institutions by enabling accurate determination of student eligibility for specific courses. To ensure robust analysis, diverse supervised algorithms were implemented, comparative evaluations were conducted, and association rule and unsupervised algorithms were employed to extract hidden patterns. In a case study involving graduates pursuing Master's degrees in Iran, the hybrid model effectively identifies Bachelor's degree majors that exhibit higher likelihoods of success in the targeted course and uncovers additional factors that significantly impact academic performance. The research outcomes highlight the considerable potential of the hybrid model in facilitating informed scholarship decisions and fostering overall institutional efficiency. Furthermore, the proposed DSS could be deployed with various educational datasets, potentially empowering decision-makers with valuable insights to distinguish between successful and unsuccessful students early in the course. This could contribute to optimizing educational outcomes and informing evidence-based policy-making.},

The rapid shift to digital education during and after COVID-19 has presented challenges for university faculty to grapple with new e-learning technologies. A qualitative research design was used to develop deep insights into upcoming e-learning trends. Data were collected from a sample of 70 teachers (35 males and 35 females) through a random sampling from the university faculty in the capital territory of Pakistan. The data collected through semi-structured interviews was analyzed qualitatively for thematic analysis using a fuzzy inference system on MATLAB, resulting in a system accuracy of 92% and a miss rate of 8%. The study identified important e-learning trends such as artificial intelligence, video-based learning, social collaboration, mobile learning, gamification, and micro-learning, emphasizing their potential for engagement and outcomes. The implementation of these strategies can significantly impact the education system, particularly on learning systems. The findings underscore the importance of universities focusing on strategic planning and faculty development. Moreover, institutes that adopt ethical policies can transform the academic environment and establish innovative structures that benefit both teachers' work and foster students' engagement, ultimately leading to improved efficiency and effectiveness. The study's findings are crucial for shaping the future of e-learning and its potential impact on the education system.},

 abstract = {Educational institutions need to formulate a well-established data-driven plan to get long-term value from their learning analytics (LA) strategy. By tracking learners’ digital traces and measuring learners’ performance, institutions can discern consequential learning trends via use of predictive models to enhance their instructional services. However, questions remain on how the proposed LA system is suitable, meaningful, and justifiable. In this concept paper, we examine generalizability and transparency of the internals of predictive models, alongside the ethical challenges in using learners’ data for building predictive capabilities. Model generalizability or transferability is hindered by inadequate feature representation, small and imbalanced datasets, concept drift, and contextually un-related domains. Additional challenges relate to trustworthiness and social acceptance of these models since algorithmic-driven models are difficult to interpret by themselves. Further, ethical dilemmas are faced in engaging with learners’ data while developing and deploying LA systems at an institutional level. We propose methodologies for apprehending these challenges by establishing efforts for managing transferability and transparency, and further assessing the ethical standing on justifiable use of the LA strategy. This study showcases underlying relationships that exist between constructs pertaining to learners’ data and the predictive model. We suggest the use of appropriate evaluation techniques and setting up research ethics protocols, since without proper controls in place, the model outcome would not be portable, transferable, trustworthy, or admissible as a responsible outcome. This concept paper has theoretical and practical implications for future inquiry in the burgeoning field of learning analytics.},

The study employs the Value Creation framework to analyze the types and value of co-created learning and explores these results to draw inferences as to the effects of CoP participation on the learners' identities, which were continuously being reformulated. The resulting CoP interactions indicated a strong immediate learning value. These also generated new insights (potential value) and familiarized learners with the characteristics of the real-world practice. The effective transfer of knowledge into the academic practice was confirmed by the significant improvements in student performances (applied & realized value).

The survey was distributed among 1773 teachers. Based on the responses of 194 university teachers, we identify differences related to responsibility, equity, and knowledge about artificial intelligence. Our quantitative data exhibited that in Case A and Case C, the respondents ranked to a higher degree that universities should use artificial intelligence tools and systems to achieve equitable outcomes. Data revealed no statistically significant associations among the respondents with regard to background variables in Case A. However, Case B and Case C disclosed statistically significant associations concerning gender, age, faculty, and academic position among the participants. Moreover, we identify teachers’ fears and scepticism about artificial intelligence in higher education, concerns about fairness and responsibility, and lack of knowledge about artificial intelligence and resources to engage with artificial intelligence in teaching practices.},

This experience combines the ICLHE (Integrating Content and Language in Higher Education) and the COIL approaches (Collaborative Online International Learning). The study has been conducted through a mixed methods perspective based on two questionnaires, distributed to all participating students before and after the project, together with follow-up semi-structured interviews to four students. Students were asked about their expectations (before) and perceptions (after) from the VBP project, respectively. Results support the view that this project applying a COIL approach may help students to consolidate their master's degree training and gain self-confidence when applying their knowledge in a real experience. The combination of these two approaches, ICLHE and COIL, seem to benefit students since they have used everything learnt and feel that the master's degree contents are widely implemented in the VBP project. However, results also reveal that students' expectations were higher than their final perceptions, which leads to pedagogical implications at the local and global level.},

Nevertheless, lack of feedback support has caused students to struggle in developing their reflective thinking skills. Despite the abundance of literature related to feedback practices, the notion of how feedback should be tailored and creatively delivered requires further research. Hence, this study aims to ascertain about how the provision of specific feedback through questioning approach can trigger specific reflective thinking skills using innovative analytical analysis technique, that is, association rules mining. An explorative case study qualitative design was employed and the study was conducted for 14 weeks. Six case-based activities that reflect real-world scenarios were created for students to critically discuss and solve in the blogging environment. Association rules data mining technique was utilised on qualitative data of reflections on both course and individual blogs, to model how feedback through questioning may influence the direction of reflective thinking skills. The findings revealed 16 important association rules and from that only Limited Focal, Open Focal, Brainstorming and Application types of feedback were discovered to lead to important reflective thinking skills development. It was also found that students’ reflective discussion cannot simply move beyond reportive/descriptive thinking and decision-making, despite being pressed by higher level feedback. The overall findings of this study also have implications towards parties like students, instructors, and syllabus and materials designers in terms of how to creatively develop and teach reflective thinking skills via the feedback through questioning approach in educational blogging environments.},

An m-learning use case was executed to evaluate the architecture's performance efficiency in a university facility. The implementation results show reduced latencies and quick response time. The architecture handles data locally on-site, lowers demand on radio access bandwidth, increases confidential data privacy, and continues the application execution even the network is disrupted. The architecture is open to redesign, reconfigure, and integrate with other computing paradigms. IoT-based m-learning use cases should be considered by reflecting learners' scaling of resource needs.

 abstract = {Background and purpose
Journal article critiques are frequently used to teach literature evaluation to pharmacy students. Peer review is one method to improve students' competency regarding journal article critiques. The objective of this manuscript is to describe implementation of electronic peer review of journal article critique drafts and explore students' intrinsic motivation to participate in the peer-review process. Influence of students' motivation to participate in peer review on their self-competence regarding journal article critiques was also explored.
Educational activity and setting
Second-year pharmacy students participated in three in-class, electronic, anonymous peer-review sessions for written journal article critique drafts. Students were invited to complete a 16-item survey instrument based on self-determination theory. Modified Intrinsic Motivation Inventory and Perceived Competence Scales assessed student interest in and perceived value of the peer-review sessions and their self-competence regarding journal article critiques.
Findings
The survey response rate was 99% (146/148). Based on a Likert scale of 1 (not at all true) to 7 (very true), students demonstrated moderate interest in the peer-review sessions (M = 3.86), viewed them as valuable (M = 5.25), and had a moderate level of self-competence regarding journal article critiques (M = 3.74). Additionally, interest and perceived value of the peer-review sessions significantly influenced self-competence in completing journal article critiques.
Summary
An anonymous, electronic peer-review system provides an efficient method for in-class peer review of draft assignments. Implementing strategies to increase student interest in peer review may increase their motivation for participation and ultimately improve self-competence regarding literature evaluation.},

We consider class imbalance problem, which means that models will be biased to yield good results on the majority of class examples and poor results on the minority of class examples. In that case, model prediction is inaccurate, which means that the false negative rate is high. To reinforce better prediction performance, a cost-sensitive technique is used in the loss function, which considers the various misclassification costs for false negatives and false positives.

The estimated effect size (Hedge's g) was positive, although not significantly different from zero and the confidence interval [-0.13, 0.25], suggesting that overall differences between blended and conventional classroom learning are small, and, at best, very small negative or moderate positive effects are plausible. This means that despite a reduction in classroom time between 30 and 79 per cent, equivalent learning outcomes were found.

 abstract = {The research reported in this paper addresses the problem of assessing higher-order thinking skills, such as reflective and creative thinking, within the context of virtual learning environments. Assessment of these skills requires process-based observations and evaluation, as the output-based methods have been found to be insufficient. Virtual learning environments offer a wealth of data on the process, which makes them good candidates for process-based evaluation, but the existing assessment methods in these environments have shortcomings, such as reliance on large data sets, inability to offer specific feedback on actions, and the lack of consideration for how actions are integrated into bigger tasks. Demonstrating and confirming the ability of three-dimensional virtual learning environments to work with process metrics for assessment, we propose and evaluate the use of motifs as an assessment tool. Motifs are short and meaningful combination of metrics. Combining time-ordered motifs with a similarity analysis between expert and learner data, our proposed approach can potentially offer feedback on specific actions that the learner takes, as opposed to single output-based feedback. It can do so without the use of large training datasets due to reliance on expert data and similarity analysis. Through a user study, we found out that such a motif-based approach can be effective in the assessment of higher-order thinking skills while addressing the identified shortcomings of previous work. We also address the limited research on similarity-based analysis methods, compare their effectiveness, and show that utilizing different similarity measures for different tasks may be a more effective approach. Our proposed method facilitates and encourages the involvement of instructors and course designers through the definition of motifs and expert problem-solving paths.},

 abstract = {The recent Covid-19 pandemic made universities rethink their traditional educational models, shifting, in some cases, to pure online or hybrid models. Hybrid settings usually involve onsite (i.e., in the classroom) and online (e.g., in a different classroom, at home) students simultaneously under the instruction of the same teacher. However, while these models provide more flexibility to students, hybridity poses additional challenges for the specific case of collaborative learning, likely increasing the teachers' orchestration load and potentially hampering fruitful interactions among learners. In order to gather empirical evidence on the impact of hybridity in collaborative learning, this paper reports a study conducted in a hybrid classroom where a Jigsaw collaborative pattern was implemented with the Engageli software. The study involved 2 teachers and 67 students enrolled in a computer science undergraduate course. Teachers' post-interviews, questionnaires and an epistemic network analysis (ENA) were used to produce study findings. Results show that teachers reported a medium-to-high orchestration load for implementing and setting up the collaborative activities in the hybrid classroom. Among the factors that contributed most to such load, teachers highlighted the creation and live management of groups and collaborative documents. Additionally, the ENA showed that teachers put much effort on monitoring group interactions and solving technical issues. Finally, we observed relevant differences on students' perceptions (e.g., satisfaction with the attention received by the teachers) based on the cohort sizes and on the students’ attendance modality (onsite vs. online).},

 abstract = {Self-regulated learning (SRL) is an essential skill for achieving one's learning goals, particularly in Digital Learning Environments (DLEs) where system support is often limited compared to traditional classroom settings. However, research has found that learners often struggle to adapt their behaviour to the self-regulatory demands of DLEs. Furthermore, existing SRL analysis tools have limited utility for real-time or individualized prescriptive support of a learner's SRL strategy during a study session. In response to these challenges, we propose a novel approach using reinforcement learning as a framework to optimize the sequence of SRL processes for a learning task. This framework allows us to model and optimize the SRL strategy as a sequential decision-making problem, where each decision corresponds to an SRL process. The goal is to find an optimal sequence of decisions that maximizes performance in learning outcomes such as assessment score or learning gains. We compare the performance of our reinforcement learning framework with other sequential machine learning tools, such as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks and Genetic Algorithms (GA). The results of our study show that our reinforcement learning model outperforms GA and LSTM models in optimizing SRL strategy. The contributions of this work can facilitate the development of a tool which can detect sub-optimal SRL strategy in real-time and enable individualized SRL focused scaffolding.},

 abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a physical shutdown of all types of educational institutes worldwide due to which the education delivery has now shifted to an “online only” exclusivity model. In this perspective, perceived usability of the online learning platforms that are currently being used is an important aspect, especially due to the absence of any physical classes. In this work Microsoft Teams is used as the reference platform for which the perceived usability is evaluated. For the evaluation purpose a dual strategy is followed by using the System Usability Scale (SUS), which is a Human Computer Interaction (HCI) based approach, and the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), which is an Information Systems (IS) based approach. Although both these instruments are popular in their respective domains, yet they have not been considered simultaneously in one work for the purpose of usability evaluation. By doing so, this work attempts to streamline and unify the process of usability evaluation. Results that are obtained from a large-scale survey of university students show the similarity and equivalency between the two methodologies, with the Perceived Ease of Use (PEOU) construct of TAM having greater similarity with SUS. Moreover, this work also considers the digital-divide aspect (mobile vs. web environment) that is prevalent particularly in developing countries like India, and whether it has any effect on the perceived usability. Results show that the consumption platform does not have any effect on the usability aspect.},

 abstract = {Post-pandemic student performance prediction has gained considerable attention within the academic community. Educational institutions worldwide have adopted blended learning approaches for delivering education and assessments. In this study, we harnessed data from the ‘Offee’ assessment platform based in Mumbai, India, spanning from September 2020 to October 2022. This dataset allows us to analyze the real impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on examinations. To tackle the challenges posed by high-dimensional data, we employed feature selection techniques to retain only the most significant features for predicting student performance. Specifically, we assessed the effectiveness of two decision tree-based methods, J48 classifier and Random Forest, in conjunction with the ranker search method using wrapper subset evaluation. The resulting feature set was then utilized to train and test a Support Vector Machine model for predicting student performance. Our findings reveal that both J48 and Random Forest feature selection methods yield impressive precision accuracy rates for student performance prediction, achieving 93.14% and 86.24%, respectively. In contrast, using the dataset without feature selection resulted in lower precision accuracy, standing at 79.9%, and consumed more time during model training and development. In summary, this study underscores the significance of feature selection in enhancing the accuracy of student performance prediction compared to utilizing the dataset without such feature curation.},

 abstract = {Many research studies confirmed that the application of machine learning methods for predicting students at risk of academic failure can be beneficial for improving student performance in higher education institutions. Simultaneously, these studies emphasised the importance of the input data quality, its precise pre-processing and thoroughly selected features on final performance metrics of the applied classification algorithms. However, the stand-alone application of well-known classification algorithms still has performance limitations, which can be outperformed using ensembles of classifiers. Therefore, this paper aims to evaluate the overall contribution of the selected ensemble methods to the early prediction of students at risk of dropping out of learning courses. All phases of CRISP-DM methodology are described in this study to explain the complexity of the problem of the practical adoption of voting-based heterogeneous ensemble methods in the case of data obtained from the course of the university learning management system compared to traditional classification algorithms enhanced by ensemble learning with AdaBoost and XGBoost methods. As a result, the study confirmed that the features which characterise the students’ performance and their interactions in the course can be considered the most significant for the identification of the students at risk of dropping out. Moreover, in the case of advanced ensemble algorithms, the overall accuracy, recall, precision, and f1 score were improved by 2-4%. The proposed method has demonstrated exceptional performance. Finally, the paper summarises the findings and their implications for effective prediction.},

This research study will help the learners learn complex concepts quickly with different activities like flipped classrooms, online quizzes, learning by doing, and a virtual laboratory. This research is carried out to address the difficulties of learners and cover all the domains of learning, including knowledge, Skill, and Attitude. The fuzzy logic method has recently been applied in education to overcome these restrictions. While employing the fuzzy logic approach to evaluate student achievement, qualifications are assessed qualitatively rather than quantitatively. This research study applies Fuzzy Logic in the first stage, Factor Analysis (FA), and Machine Learning (ML) techniques in the second stage to discover essential factors associated with the effective use of Active Learning Strategies (ALS) in the Learning Management System (LMS) of information technology course learners. Fuzzy logic and neural network topology can be coupled using ANFIS, an adaptable network. FA is performed to find the critical factors for successful learners. The study compares the performance of five supervised machine learning algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Discriminant Analysis, and Support Vector Machine. These classifiers are evaluated to determine their suitability and model fit in the context of the research. In this study, real-time data is collected from B.Tech Information Technology learners. The following prediction models achieved high accuracy before FA analysis: Naive Bayes (90 %), Support Vector Machine (89 %), Discriminant Analysis (88 %), Decision Tree (86 %), and K-Nearest Neighbors (82 %). Naive Bayes gives the best accuracy, with 90 %. Following factor analysis (FA), the accuracy achieved by various classifiers is as follows: Naive Bayes - 92 %, K-Nearest Neighbors - 92 %, Support Vector Machine - 90 %, Discriminant Analysis - 89 %, and Decision Tree - 88 %. Among these, Naive Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbors exhibit the highest accuracy of 92 %.},

Therefore, this research examines the development and evaluation of ontology-based recommender systems. The study also discusses technical ontology use and the recommendation process. We identified multidisciplinary ontology-based recommender systems in 28 journal articles. These systems combined ontology with artificial intelligence, computing technology, education, education psychology, and social sciences. Student models and learning objects remain the primary ontology use, followed by feedback, assessments, and context data. Currently, the most popular recommendation item is the learning object, but learning path, feedback, and learning device could be the future considerations. This recommendation process is reciprocal and can be initiated either by the system or students. Standard ontology languages are commonly used, but standards for student profiles and learning object metadata are rarely adopted. Moreover, ontology-based recommender systems seldom use the methodology of building ontologies and hardly use other ontology methodologies. Similarly, none of the primary studies described ontology evaluation methodologies, but the systems are evaluated by nonreal students, algorithmic performance tests, statistics, questionnaires, and qualitative observations. In conclusion, the findings support the implementation of ontology methodologies and the integration of ontology-based recommendations into existing learning technologies. The study also promotes the use of recommender systems in social science and humanities courses, non-higher education, and open learning environments.},

 abstract = {Researchers and many educators agree that the ability to self-regulate learning is important for academic success. Yet, many students struggle to anticipate learning difficulties and adjust accordingly. Further, despite theorizing that self-regulated learning involves adaptation across learning cycles, few researchers have examined students’ evaluative judgments, their implications for students’ behavior in a subsequent learning cycle, or their effects on achievement. Utilizing data from a large, introductory college biology course, we examined how struggling students’ evaluative judgments made after a first unit exam predicted changes in learning behaviors as well as how those changes predicted performance on a subsequent exam. We used natural language processing to analyze data from a reflective essay written after a first unit exam, identifying language that reflected evaluation of prior studying and plans to adapt learning. Then, we utilized digital traces of learning behaviors to measure students’ actual adaptation of their use of learning resources. Results from a path analysis revealed students’ evaluations predicted how extensively they discussed plans to adapt their learning process. Plans to adapt described in written reflections predicted an increase in the frequency of desirable learning behaviors, which in turn predicted higher subsequent exam scores, after controlling for previous exam performance. These findings provide empirical evidence of multiple theorized self-regulated learning processes, including how evaluations of learning at the end of a learning cycle can inform planning and behavior changes in a subsequent learning cycle, and that increases in the enactment of effective learning strategies predict improved performance in complex learning tasks.},

 abstract = {Adaptive learning, which aims to give each learner engaging, effective learning experiences, is one method of offering modified education. Adaptive learning seeks to consider the student's unique characteristics by personalizing the learning course materials and evaluation procedures. To determine the student's preferred learning strategies, we first ascertain their attributes utilizing VAK learning styles. In this study, we developed an integrated model to classify learners based on their learning activity clicks by combining machine learning algorithms like K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) and Logistic regression (LR) with semantic association, which is used to help us map learning activity with VAK learning style. This enables us to classify learners, determine their preferred methods of learning, and offer the most suitable; as a result, we were able to group pupils according to their learning styles and provide the best evaluation technique or strategies. To assess the effectiveness of the suggested model, several tests were executed on the actual dataset (Open University Learning Analytics Dataset, or OULAD). According to studies, using a Random Forest algorithm, the suggested model can predict which evaluation strategy or strategies will be most effective for each student and can classify individuals with the highest degree of accuracy—98%.},

 abstract = {An affective state of a learner in E-learning has gained enormous interest. The prediction of the emotional state of a learner can enhance the outcome of learning by including designated mediation. Many techniques are developed for anticipating emotional states using video, audio, and bio-sensors. Still, examining video, and audio will not confirm secretiveness and is exposed to security issues. Here the creator devises a fusion technique, to be specific Squirrel Search and Rider optimization-grounded Deep LSTM for affect prediction. The Deep LSTM is trained to exercise the new fusion SS-ROA. Then, the SS-ROA-grounded Deep LSTM classifies the states like frustration, confusion, engagement, wrathfulness, and so on. It is based on the interaction log data of the E-learner. In conclusion, the course and student ID, predicted state, test marks, and course completion status are taken as result information to find out the correlations. The new algorithm gives the best performance in comparison to other present methods with the highest prediction accurateness of 0.962 and the most noteworthy connection of 0.379 respectively. After discovering affective states, students may get the advantage of getting real comments from a teacher for improving one's performance during learning. However, such systems should also give feedback about the learner's affective state or passion because it greatly affects the student's encouragement toward better learning.},

 abstract = {Educational institutions continually strive to improve the services they offer, their aim is to have the best possible teaching staff, increase the quality of teaching and the academic performance of their students. A knowledge of the factors that affect student learning could help universities and study centres adjust their curricula and teaching methods to the needs of their students. One of the first measures employed by teaching institutions was to create Virtual Learning Environments (VLEs). This type of environment makes it possible to attract a larger number of students because it enables them to study from wherever they are in the world, meaning that the student’s location is no longer a constraint. Moreover, VLEs facilitate access to teaching resources, they make it easier to monitor the activity of the teaching staff and of the interactions between students and teachers. Thus, online environments make it possible to assess the factors that cause the students’ academic performance to increase or decrease. To understand the factors that influence the university learning process, this paper applies a series of automatic learning techniques to a public dataset, including tree-based models and different types of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). Having applied these techniques to the dataset, the number of times students have accessed the resources made available on VLE platforms has been identified as a key factor affecting student performance. This factor has been analysed by conducting a real case study which has involved 120 students doing a masters degree over a VLE platform. Concretely, the case study participants were masters degree students in areas related to computer engineering at the University of Salamanca.},

 abstract = {Recently, educational stakeholders have seen an accelerated move to online learning within which the ability to correspond effectively depends on good writing skills. Language learners are increasingly being asked to navigate new digital genres, such as academic blogs and discussion boards, without access to empirically-based descriptions of corresponding genre conventions. Furthermore, researchers have utilized multiple methods for assessing writing within this genre, ranging from full credit for completion to rubrics based on complexity, accuracy, and fluency. A genre-based approach to writing assessment would suggest identifying key features of academic blogs, and in turn, utilizing those descriptions to guide learners in improving their writing performance. For this project, six knowledgeable individuals reviewed the academic blog posts written by 148 English as a foreign language university students in response to a prompt on the pros and cons of using technology for language learning. The reviewers sorted the posts into six groups in order of merit, and they described each post with short phrases. This data informed the creation of a blog-specific analytic rubric containing five categories around which the reviewers assessed learners’ written performance: task fulfillment and relevancy, content, organization and balance, genre specific features (i.e., use of emojis and hyperlinks), and language use.},

 abstract = {This article presents institutional case studies of technology use in language and literacy instruction at two rural high schools based on almost two months of classroom observations as well as interviews with teachers, administrators, and students. The first school presented faced a number of funding issues and clearly lacked in terms of access—the teachers regularly expressed frustration with district leadership and lamented their ability to have students do more computer-based literacy work. The second school presented had a very different issue—through a series of grants, they had secured computers for every student in their English classes but teachers had varying level of training on how to incorporate them in learning and consequently, the computers were often used in reductive ways. This research provides a perspective that shows the limitations of large-scale comparisons, emphasizing how local contextual factors (such as school leadership and teacher training) can shape both access and use. It also shows how access is only one piece of the picture—without sufficient teacher training and support, available technology may help perpetuate reductive educational practices in language and literacy instruction .},

Data from students' mid-term and end-of-term questionnaires, as well as teachers' journals, were collected in the Spring, and follow-up teacher interviews were carried out in Fall 2020. Results indicate that students' overall stress levels diminished from beginning to end of the academic term but that individual experiences were extremely varied. While some students enjoyed the increased autonomy and self-paced learning opportunities of the online format, others felt distressed in this less directed modality and emphasized the negative effect of reduced social interactions on their levels of engagement. Only few students mentioned technological difficulties as a central challenge in their learning process, but many believed that they had learned less than in traditional face-to-face courses. Instructors’ views differed in this respect, as they considered that the reduced group-size of synchronous Zoom sessions allowed them to hear more of each student, which they saw as evidence of increased student talk as compared to the usual whole-class face-to-face sessions. This more intimate virtual set-up also increased a sense of proximity between teachers and students.},

Participants included 160 business students at local universities. The results indicated that students' motivation to use face-to-face learning had a great impact on their satisfaction, but this had only a marginal effect on their academic performance. On the other hand, students' motivation to use online learning significantly influences their learning satisfaction and, in turn, has a strong impact on their academic performance. As for the blended learning model, students’ motivation to use this mode of learning positively impacted their learning satisfaction. However, students of this mode had relatively lower academic performance compared to other modes of learning.},

 abstract = {In higher education, providing personalized feedback and support to students is a significant challenge. Early warning systems can help by identifying both at-risk and high-performing students, allowing for timely interventions and enhanced learning opportunities. In our study, we used a year's worth of data from an information management school to build predictive models for two binary classification problems: identifying at-risk students and high-performing students. We employed traditional machine learning classifiers and long-short term memory units (LSTM), testing them at various stages of course completion. The best performance was achieved using all course data, with an AUC of 0.756 for at-risk students and 78.2% accuracy for high-performing students using Random Forest and Extremely Randomized Trees, respectively. We found that early prediction was possible as early as 25% course completion. Although LSTM showed inferior performance, it offered practical advantages for early prediction. Our findings suggest that static LMS logs can be reliable indicators of student success early in a course, and a course-agnostic time-dependent representation of the number of clicks can offer a worthwhile tradeoff between predictive performance and simplicity in implementation in some instances. These findings have important implications as they suggest the potential for automated early warning systems that can help educators identify students of interest and allocate resources where they are most needed. However, implementing these systems in real-time requires clear protocols and responsible policies. Further research should explore the generalizability of findings across different contexts and continuously evaluate their real-world effectiveness.},

 abstract = {Student engagement has a trajectory (a timeline) that unfolds over time and can be shaped by different factors including learners’ motivation, school conditions, and the nature of learning tasks. Such factors may result in either a stable, declining or fluctuating engagement trajectory. While research on online engagement is abundant, most authors have examined student engagement in a single course or two. Little research has been devoted to studying online longitudinal engagement, i.e., the evolution of student engagement over a full educational program. This learning analytics study examines the engagement states (sequences, successions, stability, and transitions) of 106 students in 1396 course enrollments over a full program. All data of students enrolled in the academic year 2014–2015, and their subsequent data in 2015–2016, 2016–2017, and 2017–2018 (15 courses) were collected. The engagement states were clustered using Hidden Markov Models (HMM) to uncover the hidden engagement trajectories which resulted in a mostly-engaged (33% of students), an intermediate (39.6%), and a troubled (27.4%) trajectory. The mostly-engaged trajectory was stable with infrequent changes, scored the highest, and was less likely to drop out. The troubled trajectory showed early disengagement, frequent dropouts and scored the lowest grades. The results of our study show how to identify early program disengagement (activities within the third decile) and when students may drop out (first year and early second year).},

Existing research has mostly focused on a single course or two, while longitudinal studies remain scarce.

We use a large dataset of online traces from 135 students who completed 10 successive courses (i.e., 1350 course enrollments) in a higher education program. The methods used in this study have shown the feasibility of using trace data recorded by learning management systems to unobtrusively trace and model the longitudinal learning strategies across a program. We identified three program-level strategy trajectories: a stable and intense trajectory related to deep learning where students used diverse strategies and scored the highest grades; a fluctuating interactive trajectory, where students focused on course requirements, scored average grades, and were relatively fluctuating; and a light trajectory related to surface learning where students invested the least effort, scored the lowest grades, and had a relatively stable pathway. Students who were intensely active were more likely to transfer the intense strategies and therefore, they were expected to require less support or guidance. Students focusing on course requirements were not as effective self-regulators as they seemed and possibly required early guidance and support from teachers. Students with consistent light strategies or low effort needed proactive guidance and support.},

Our study addresses such a gap and investigates how engagement evolves or changes over time, using a person-centered approach to identify for whom the changes happen and when. We take advantage of a novel and innovative multistate Markov model to identify what variables influence such transitions and with what magnitude, i.e., to answer the why. We use a large data set of 1428 enrollments in six courses (238 students). The findings show that online engagement changes differently —across students— and at different magnitudes —according to different instructional variables and previous engagement states. Cognitively engaging instructions helped cognitively engaged students stay engaged while negatively affecting disengaged students. Lectures —a resource that requires less mental energy— helped improve disengaged students. Such differential effects point to the different ways interventions can be applied to different groups, and how different groups may be supported. A balanced, carefully tailored approach is needed to design, intervene, or support students' engagement that takes into account the diversity of engagement states as well as the varied response magnitudes that intervention may incur across diverse students’ profiles.},

Utilizing the data from 139 interventions and 375 effect sizes, we found (a) a strong effect of learning computer programming per se (Hedges’ g‾ = 0.81, 95% CI [0.42, 1.21]), (b) moderate to large effect sizes of visualization (g‾ = 0.44, 95% CI [0.29, 0.58]) and physicality interventions (g‾ = 0.72, 95% CI [0.23, 1.21]), and (c) moderate to large effect sizes for studies focusing on dominant instructional approaches (g‾s = 0.49–1.02). Moderator analyses indicated that the effect sizes differed only marginally between the instructional approaches and conditions—however, collaboration in metacognition instruction, problem solving instruction outside of regular lessons, short-term interventions focusing on physicality, and interventions focusing on visualization through Scratch were especially effective.

After systematic search and filtering from a search pool of 3038 studies published between 2016 and 2021, we selected 38 articles for detailed meta-analysis. Our findings reveal that 71% of the reviewed studies are journal articles, 50% studies focus on learning analytics, and the majority of the studies employ quantitative approaches. The results from this systematic review suggest that XR technologies have received least attention to date in computing education (amongst the emerging technologies considered for the review) and there is a lack of frameworks for design, evaluation and use of emerging technologies in higher education. The findings of this review will be beneficial for researchers and educators to obtain an in-depth understanding of the main areas of application of emerging technologies in higher education computing education, an inventory of emerging technology tools used for assessment and feedback, effectiveness indicators, and evaluation approaches that have been used. For evidence-based guidance on future assessment and feedback practices using emerging technologies, we also present a brief research agenda, drawing attention to the need to trial more XR, focus on formative assessment and feedback practices, better understand impact of human-centric issues and take more thoughtful consideration of ethics in the use of emerging technologies in computing education.},

 abstract = {The new theory of education suggests that learner should be in the center of the learning process and the instructor playing an advising and facilitating role. Building smart learning environments supported by e-learning platforms is an important area of research. The rapid and continuous development of technology that has brought new learning skills for students forces the educational system to enter into a new era. This change is further justified by some unprecedented events that force students to learn remotely. QLearn is an e-learning platform developed as a web based application which provides quizzes for students enrolled at Advanced Programming Methods course from Babeş Bolyai University (Romania) as part of their formative and summative assessment. The existing set of quizzes has been proposed by students throughout the last three iterations of the course in a collaborative manner with course instructor, and this data set is expanding continuously with every new generation of students. QLearn is a smart learning environment offering the students valuable feedback and a good preparation for the exam. Some metrics that quantify the coverage rate of the course syllabus attained by students or their understanding level of knowledge are provided by QLearn. The Artificial Intelligent component of QLearn application uses these measures to make predictions for students’ outcomes at the exam, to find out which topics need to be practised more and to recommend learning plans according to students’ individual needs. The contribution of the paper is therefore twofold. Firstly, we propose a new learning design, based on students’ involvement in a collaborative manner. The second contribution of the paper is QLearn, a software application that provides support (implementation) for the proposed learning process design. Not only does QLearn platform provide a smart learning environment for students, but it also ensures the knowledge transfer from instructors to students in an efficient and effective way.},

Its adoption in higher education is an innovation as well as a disruption to conventional learning mechanisms. To further understand its development from the perspective of academic communities, a hybrid bibliometric approach that combines both direct citation network analysis and text analytics was proposed to examine the related research articles retrieved from the Web of Science database. In addition to visual analytics on the TEL research, a direct citation network approach with cluster analysis was used to delineate the historiographic development of the TEL research domain in higher education. Among the top internally cited articles, five main streams of TEL development were identified, namely adoption, critique, social media, podcasting, and blended learning. Then, the accumulated state of knowledge was summarized by highlighting the essential subgroup topics in each stream with latent semantic analysis. The extraction of the key features of the research domain by the proposed hybrid approach, including the principal streams of development, associated subgroup topics, and a critical article list, contributes a comprehensive method to enable the rapid understanding of the overall research development of the TEL in higher education.},

Academic help-seeking is a quite prevalent phenomenon that supports students to learn knowledge and improve academic performance. This study is aiming to understand learners and associate their performances via exploiting academic help-seeking moods with online learning of institutional education setting. Adopting the relevant theories, we propose a novel research model and identify three different online help-seeking moods, which are namely goal-directed seeker, exploratory seeker and avoidant seeker. Goal-directed seekers are described with preference for more challenging assignments and more posting on the platform discussion board frequently. Exploratory seekers hold the highest achievements during all help-seeking moods. Avoidant seekers are well-distinguished by holding the lowest frequency of posting among all moods and the most average time spent on the platform. Students have collective preferences for assignment submission in each help-seeking mood, and deviation from those preferences increases their probability of dropping academic grade significantly. To the best of our knowledge, this research is the first work that characterizes the help-seeking moods and associates moods with the enrollment performance for online education of institutional student.},

 abstract = {Despite the proliferation of video-based instruction and its benefits—such as promoting student autonomy and self-paced learning—the complexities of online teaching remain a challenge. To be effective, educators require extensive training in digital teaching methodologies. As such, there's a pressing need to examine and comprehend the intricacies of instructors' communication patterns within this context. This research addresses the pressing need to understand pedagogical discourse in online video lectures in Algebra classes by employing computational linguistic tools and natural language processing (NLP). Using transcripts from 125 Algebra 1 video lectures—comprising 4962 instances of pedagogical discourse—from five instructors at Math Nation, a virtual math learning environment, we analyzed the conveyance of linguistic, attitudinal, and emotional nuances. With the aid of 26 Coh-Metrix and SÉANCE features, we classified educators' language choices, achieving an accuracy of 86.7%. Furthermore, variations in language choices, as signified by discourse markers, were examined through a K-means clustering approach. The resulting 17 clusters were grouped into interpersonal, structural, and cognitive pedagogic functions. Through this exploration, we demonstrate the promising potential of NLP in efficiently deciphering pedagogical communication patterns in video lectures. These insights open a new avenue for research, aimed at assessing the efficacy of digital instruction by scrutinizing pedagogical discourse characteristics in computer-based learning environments.},

 abstract = {Prior research has suggested that participation in peer feedback activities, specifically the giving and receiving of comments, and the implementation of suggested ideas helps to improve writing quality. However, it is not always the case that received feedback is implemented. Currently, there is uncertainty regarding how the total number of comments received during a peer feedback activity interacts with the number of implemented comments and subsequent text quality. Therefore, the present study examined the online peer feedback sessions of 186 graduate students enrolled in a scientific writing course at a Korean university. It aimed to investigate the possible moderating effect of the total number of comments on the relationship between implementation of comments and student writing performance. The results showed that there is no relationship between the number of received comments and student writing performance. Furthermore, no significant correlation was observed between the number of implemented comments and student writing performance. However, importantly, a moderating effect of the total number of comments on the relationship between implementation of comments and student writing performance was found. In other words, the more total comments students receive, the less their implementation will be associated with significant improvement of writing quality. This result is significant because it suggests that in online collaborative learning contexts, there is an upper limit of peer comments, above which the original author can no longer effectively implement them to improve writing performance.},

Interpretability makes it easy for the stakeholders to understand the working of these models and adaptability makes it easy to use the same model for multiple cohorts and courses in educational institutions. Recently, some models in learning analytics are constructed with the consideration of interpretability but their interpretability is not quantified. However, adaptability is not specifically considered in this domain. This paper presents a new framework based on hybrid statistical fuzzy theory to overcome these limitations. It also provides explainability in the form of rules describing the reasoning behind a particular output. The paper also discusses the system evaluation on a benchmark dataset showing promising results. The measure of explainability, fuzzy index, shows that the model is highly interpretable. This system achieves more than 82% recall in both the classification and the context adaptation stages.},

 abstract = {Against the background of the burgeoning use of online learning in higher education, and more recently the online flipped classroom, this study sets out to evaluate the efficacy of the online flipped classroom. To this end, a campus-based course in applied physics for master and doctoral students was transformed into an online flipped course. We analyse how this transformation and student participation in specific asynchronous and synchronous learning activities affect performance for the online flipped format. Results reveal that, while there was no statistically significant difference in average performance between the campus-based and online flipped format, the online flipped format led to a significantly larger spread - a polarization - in performance. Further, drawing on transactional distance theory, we attribute this polarization to a higher oscillation in transactional distance for the online flipped format. This link between transactional distance and performance constitutes the main theoretical contribution of this paper. Our findings speak to the importance of analysing shifts in transactional distance across learning activities to better understand their potential to bolster student learning. Future research would do well to focus on how students experience such shifts in transactional distance, and online instructors need to consider how to scaffold students during these shifts.},

We have analyzed what determines the evaluation of online studies, the frequency of participation in online courses, and the preferences regarding the mode of study in the future (offline vs. online). For this purpose, we conducted research in late March and early April 2020 among management students attending one business school in Warsaw. The respondents included native residents of Poland, as well as migrants from countries of the former Soviet Union. We analyze survey responses provided by 317 respondents. We used the chi-squared test, the Kruskal-Wallis test, and the Mann-Whitney test to verify relationships between variables. According to the analysis, the student engagement variable determines the current evaluation of online studying, the change in frequency of participation since the introduction of online classes, and the preferred mode of study (online or offline). The time required to commute to the business school determines only the preferred mode of study in the future, while students' nationality determines their assessment of online studying and the frequency of participation in online courses.},

 abstract = {Teacher talk is an integral part of classroom dialogue. However, emerging empirical research has shown inconsistent correlations between specific teacher talk moves (TTMs) and student achievement, motivating us to synthesise previous results to provide robust evidence. Using three-level meta-analytic techniques, this study examined the associations between teacher talk (dialogic and monologic orientations), specific TTMs, and student achievement in K–12 classrooms. Based on a synthesis of 16 studies with 51 effect sizes, we found a significant positive correlation between teacher talk and student achievement (r = .19). For the two orientations of teacher talk, dialogic teacher talk was moderately correlated with student achievement (r = .25), whereas monologic teacher talk was not significantly related to student achievement (r = .05). In terms of specific dialogic TTMs, analyses revealed significant and moderate associations of inviting students to share ideas and asking uptake questions with student achievement (r = .40 and r = .26, respectively), whereas high-quality feedback from teachers was not significantly related to student achievement (r = .26). Furthermore, the relationship between dialogic teacher talk and student achievement was mediated by student engagement, but not moderated by geographical region, grade level, achievement domain, or measure of teacher talk. This study sheds light on the importance of dialogic pedagogical approaches in relation to academic achievement, as well as the centrality of teachers’ encouragement of students to share, articulate, and co-construct ideas in creating dialogic educational environments.},

Each member of the OSCE writing team independently reviewed the analytical checklist and calculated a passing score for active stations on OSCEs. Then the group met to determine a final pass score for each station. The team also determined critical cut points for each station, when indicated. After administration of the OSCEs, scores, pass rates, and need for remediation were compared to the previous norm-referenced method. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the data.
Findings
OSCE scores remained relatively unchanged when switched to a criterion-referenced method, but the number of remediators increased up to 2.6 fold. In the first year, the average score increased from 86.8% to 91.7% while the remediation rate increased from 2.8% to 7.4%. In the third year, the average increased from 90.9% to 92% while the remediation rate increased from 6% to 15.6%. Likewise, the fourth-year average increased from 84.9% to 87.5% while the remediation rate increased from 4.4% to 9%.
Summary
Transition to a modified Angoff method did not impact average OSCE score but did increase the number of remediations.},

 abstract = {Modern intelligent systems nowadays make significant use of human–computer interaction (HCI). Questions of human perception, human intelligence, human cognitive capabilities, human decision-making capabilities, and interactive techniques of visualization are dealt with by HCI. Whereas, the questions of machine intelligence and data mining is dealt with by knowledge discovery in databases (KDD). HCI mainly emphasizes supervised methods. Automatic computational methods can be worked upon by combining the capabilities of both HCI and KDD. The development of algorithms that are scalable for discovering earlier unknown associations in the data thus are based on automatic computational methods by combining the capabilities of both. The first HCI happens in the primitive years of a child. The digital era we are living in and all the more pandemics have made our education system adapt to the newest technology with open hands. Challenging times in the field of education have been conquered by the fast adaptation of the latest technology and trends. It is not going to stop here and will become an integral part of our education system. The latest technologies like artificial intelligence and data mining are known for their predictive capabilities and can play a significant role in the field of education, specifically in the higher education system. Every year a substantial number of graduates strive in the job market for decent employment opportunities. On the contrary, the economy of the world is not generating adequate employment opportunities. The pandemic has made the situation even worse with lots of job cutdowns. To increase the possibility of obtaining a decent job, institutes need to improve their academic qualification. They should also equip students with essential employability skills. Accurate prediction of graduates' employability at early stages such as in the very first year of their course enrollment can be of great help. This chapter projects a proposal for building a system that applies the KDD–HCI integrated approach by showcasing a case study for prediction of employability in higher education by using data generated and stored after HCI in various tests. The framework proposed in this chapter provides a generalized solution to students' employability prediction by integrating supervised and unsupervised techniques of artificial intelligence. These skills can be tested first with HCI by conducting various tests of students at the entry level. The scores obtained then go through the process of employability prediction with the help of the proposed framework, which can help in deciding the skills to be improved in an individual student before they compete, thus improving the chance of selection. Therefore, the proposed framework provides a customized solution to every student.},

To contribute towards addressing this shortcoming, this study reports on the use of a project-based assessment for learning, requiring team innovation, in an undergraduate accounting course. In particular, this study documents the design of the project, analyses the student teams' innovative outputs, and reports the students' individual reflections on collaboratively creating these outputs. The analysis of the students' outputs and their responses to a survey, suggest that most of the students' experience of the team innovation project was positive and the project enabled them to socially construct their knowledge of accounting and to develop their team innovation competence. This study contributes towards bridging the gap between professional education and practice and provides a basis for instructors to further develop students’ team innovation competence, even in disciplines not typically characterized as being innovative.},

In this study, using the data of over 30,000 students from the Open University (UK), we implement a deep-learning-based approach using adversarial networks, Sequential Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (SC-GAN) that encapsulates the past behavior of each student for its previous sequences and generates synthetic student records for the next timestamp. The proposed approach is devised to generate instances, which are augmented with the actual data to eliminate class imbalance. A performance comparison of the proposed SC-GAN with the standard up-sampling methods is also presented and the results validate the proposed method with an improved AUC of 7.07% and 6.53%, respectively, when compared with conventional Random Over-sampling and Sythetic Minority Oversampling techniques.},

 abstract = {In recent years, flipped classrooms have become increasingly popular in higher education environments. In tandem, there is an increasing interest in engagement analytics and educational data mining to identify how students directly engage with content and resources. The Flipped Learning Network (FLN) defines flipped learning as a pedagogical approach in which direct instruction moves from the group learning space to the individual learning space. The resulting group space is transformed into a dynamic, interactive learning environment where instructors guide students as they apply concepts and engage creatively with subject matter. To engage in flipped learning effectively, instructors incorporate four pillars into their educational practice (F-L-I-P): Flexible Environment, Learning Culture, Intentional Content and Professional Educator. This study focuses primarily on one pillar of F-L-I-P i.e., Intentional Content, provided to maximise classroom time, to better utilise teaching and learning methods for a more student-centred, active learning experience. This exploratory study uses log-file data generated by the Learning Management System (LMS) to identify patterns, usage, and engagement of 468 undergraduate students. Firstly, the study investigates what intentional content students effectively engage with, for learning. Secondly, it investigates usage frequency and specific intervals, with a view to identifying critical times in the semester where intentional content is perceived as essential by students. Thirdly, the study explores how intentional content supplements other elements of the FLIP environment. Preliminary findings indicate a discernible pattern of usage, and usage frequency of intentional content amongst students. Engagement is ad hoc; and in the main the behaviour is fragmented, inconsistent, and disjointed-overall students are not engaging effectively and consistently. Additionally, the distribution of intentional content engagement is skewed towards the start and end of semester, emphasising these intervals as critical points. Of note, more consistent behaviour is adopted at the beginning of the module, however students become less engaged with all content as the term progresses. Conversely, a change in student behaviour is observed as the term comes to a close, whereby more positive patterns emerge -perhaps attributable to pending examinations.},

 abstract = {Flipped classrooms are becoming increasingly important in higher education. While their value over traditional practices has been identified, it is possible to implement a flipped classroom in many ways. Therefore, research needs to consider the distinct ways flipped classrooms are structured to identify their relative effectiveness. The usefulness of flipped classrooms is reduced when students’ procrastination in the pre-class phase, resulting in a lack of student engagement with online resources. This paper uses a cluster analysis of log-file data from three cohorts of a flipped classroom module, involving 169 undergraduate business students, to identify their learning strategies. It considers when students first begin to access online material and relates this to the timing of their classes and assessments. Two distinct learning strategies were identified. Prepared students accessed online resources as expected in advance of flipped classes. Assessment-focused students used the available resources after class to prepare for impending assessments. Prepared students performed significantly better than those that were assessment focused. In addition, there was more engagement with video-based material over text-based resources and also more engagement when assessments were weekly and low-stakes rather than terminal and higher-stakes. Concsequently, the way in which flipped classrooms are structured can reduce the level of student procrastination present and improve the effectiveness of this method.},

 abstract = {Flipped classrooms supported by learning management systems (LMS) have been widely adopted by educational institutions. However, earlier studies have found problems with interpreting LMS log data to understand student approaches to learning within the context of a learning design. This study investigates whether it is possible to use LMS log data as a proxy to understand students' learning strategies over different periods of time in the flipped-classroom context. A total of 135 sophomores from two classes of a flipped programming course participated in this study. Exploratory factor analysis is first conducted on the log data to synthesize second-order predictors based on the total-effort model. Then, we investigate the extent to which these second-order predictors relate to students' learning outcomes over time. Four types of learning outcomes are considered, including a quiz, a midterm exam, a final exam and the final grade. For each type of learning outcome, multiple linear regression is used to construct a weekly prediction model from these predictors. Adjusted R-squared and RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) are the metrics used to compare the models. The results show that consistent second-order predictors can be derived from log data, implying that students' clicking events in LMS could manifest students' learning strategies understandable in the design context of a flipped classroom. Furthermore, compared with the first-order models, most of the models constructed using the second-order predictors have higher predictive performance, although with lower data fitness. In addition, the predictive performance of the models with MSLQ (Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire) indicators and past assessment data are also examined. It is found that MSQL variables have a positive but short-termed effect on the models’ predictive ability, while past assessment data greatly improve the models of all types of learning outcomes. Theoretical contributions and implications of the proposed approach for practice, research and future research are discussed.},

Using an autoethnographic account of the lived experiences of a multiple instructor team, this study focused on a subject delivered to first-year students transitioning to the university during pre-COVID and post-COVID (two teaching semesters in 2019 and two teaching semesters in 2020). Despite higher levels of assumed digital literacy, we found that first-year university students of the digital generation required more structure than autonomy. We argue that instructor collaboration ensures consistency of a team approach to teaching in a BL environment and improves student transition to autonomous learning. We suggest practices and policies for teaching large student cohorts involving multiple instructors and offer insight to explore further TDT can be considered in this regard.},

 abstract = {This study investigated how students' cognitive load patterns related to their self-regulated learning (SRL) and performance. One hundred and eleven medical students were required to accomplish a diagnostic task in a computer-based learning environment. The metacognitive aspects of SRL were reported by students at different points during the task, and cognitive load was rated after students finished the task. We extracted SRL behaviors from system logfiles, and students' performance was measured as diagnostic accuracy, which indicated whether they achieved an accurate diagnosis. A two-step cluster analysis was conducted to identify students’ cognitive load patterns based on their perceived intrinsic, extraneous, and germane load. We found three cognitive load patterns: knowledge builders with a low-level intrinsic and extraneous load but high-level germane load, task-loaded learners with a high-level intrinsic and extraneous load but low-level germane load, and overloaded learners with high-level intrinsic, extraneous, and germane load. Moreover, we performed epistemic network analyses to compare the SRL behavior networks of the three clusters. The results showed that knowledge builders exhibited stronger connections associated with monitoring behaviors, while task-loaded and overloaded learners constructed more connections associated with help-seeking behaviors. The transitions between evaluation and solution elaboration behaviors were more frequent for knowledge builders than for the other clusters. Furthermore, knowledge builders reported higher scores in two types of metacognitive judgments: ease-of-learning and judgment-of-learning. Knowledge builders also achieved significantly higher diagnostic accuracy than task-loaded and overloaded students. These findings contributed to a more comprehensive understanding of how cognitive load interacts with SRL.},

 abstract = {Predicting students’ academic achievements is an essential issue in education, which can benefit many stakeholders, for instance, students, teachers, managers, etc. Compared with online courses such as MOOCs, students’ academic-related data in the face-to-face physical teaching environment is usually sparsity, and the sample size is relatively small. It makes building models to predict students’ performance accurately in such an environment even more challenging. This paper proposes a Two-Way Neural Network (TWNN) model based on the bidirectional recurrent neural network and graph neural network to predict students’ next semester’s course performance using only their previous course achievements. Extensive experiments on a real dataset show that our model performs better than the baselines in many indicators.},

 abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has led to a shift in modern dance education. Immersive technologies have become increasingly common worldwide, helping educators to improve the quality of dance pedagogy and increase the effectiveness of dance training. The article investigates the ways of using immersive technologies powered by artificial intelligence in dance education. The research explores the theoretical literature on dance education and the use of artificial intelligence in dance education and dance choreography. The scholars examine the impact of innovative technology solutions used in dance pedagogical practice on the development of dance skills in students. The study also discusses the functionality of interactive and multimedia dance teaching systems, including AI-powered virtual mentoring and cognitive simulations of human mind operations. The research analysed the use of virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR) in dance education. This research also focuses on mobile applications used for teaching modern dance. The proposed framework for dance education is based on digital technologies, which help to develop dance skills and improve teaching practices. The scholars conclude that the development and improvement of dance skills are possible only if a teacher combines virtual and real environments in everyday practices. The findings can be used by dance teachers, professional dancers, software developers, and researchers who examine the innovative practices and the application of artificial intelligence in dance education. The ecosystem model reframes thinking about approaches to dance education and can serve as the basis for further development of dance courses and dance style teaching modes.},

 abstract = {Background
With increasing use of social networks among university learners, its role in communication channels in connectivists teaching context needs examination.
Aims
This study investigates the role of communication channels in social networks as learners engage in a negotiation simulation RPG.
Samples
The current study collects data from 20 groups of learners in a fully online modality where learners are engaged in the negotiation simulation RPG.
Methods
Set in a fully online class, using a RPG that requires high levels of communication among participants, communication channel use is measured. Behavior data tracks actions between groups in the learning RPG database, allowing social network analysis.
Results
Results show social network apps are most often used by learners for both intra and intergroup conversations. Surprisingly, increased inter-group communication does not always improve learner performance in a connectivist setting. Instead, each additional communication quickly improves performance up to a certain point. After that point, more communication does not necessarily lead to better performance.
Conclusion
Instructors and administrators need to find ways to welcome technology platforms, like social media, into the classroom. However, social media platforms are in no way designed to fit a specific class and bring their own set of issues that can run counter to the class goals or instructional methods.},

 abstract = {While research has highlighted the importance of translanguaging for emergent multilingual learners (EMLs), very few studies have focused on teacher candidates (TCs)’ knowledge of translanguaging and how they implement the pedagogy. Using ethnographic methods and multimodal conversation analysis, this study examined how an English as an Additional Language (EAL) TC's knowledge of translanguaging evolved and how she bridged theory to practice in a field-based setting. The participant was a multilingual speaker who did not speak her EMLs' home languages. Data sources included: 1) the participant's course assessments, 2) a reflection, and 3) transcripts of a video classroom observation. The findings revealed her strong stance and ability to use a variety of strategies to create a translanguaging space, as a result of her training. We recommend teachers to enrich their pedagogical repertoire by understanding the affordances of a diverse range of multilingual, multimodal, and multi-sensory resources to effectively facilitate the teaching and learning processes. We also advise teacher educators to be intentional in course design, offering opportunities for TCs to reflect and connect their second language acquisition knowledge with pedagogical translanguaging in order to discover their own ways to create a translanguaging space for EMLs.},

 abstract = {E-learning platforms and processes face several challenges, among which
is the idea of personalizing the e-learning experience and to keep
students motivated and engaged. This work is part of a larger study that
aims to tackle these two challenges using a variety of machine learning
techniques. To that end, this paper proposes the use of k-means
algorithm to cluster students based on 12 engagement metrics divided
into two categories: interaction-related and effort-related.
Quantitative analysis is performed to identify the students that are not
engaged who may need help. Three different clustering models are
considered: two-level, three-level, and five-level. The considered
dataset is the students' event log of a second-year undergraduate
Science course from a North American university that was given in a
blended format. The event log is transformed using MATLAB to generate a
new dataset representing the considered metrics. Experimental results'
analysis shows that among the considered interaction-related and
effort-related metrics, the number of logins and the average duration to
submit assignments are the most representative of the students'
engagement level. Furthermore, using the silhouette coefficient as a
performance metric, it is shown that the two-level model offers the best
performance in terms of cluster separation. However, the three-level
model has a similar performance while better identifying students with
low engagement levels.},

 abstract = {Higher education institutes are increasingly turning their attention to
web-based learning management systems. The purpose of this study is to
investigate whether data collected from LMS can be used to predict
student performance in classrooms that use LMS to supplement
face-to-face teaching. Data was collected from eight courses spread
across two semesters at a private university in Lebanon. Event history
analysis was used to investigate whether the probability of logging in
was related to the gender and grade of the students. Results indicate
that students with higher grades login more frequently to the LMS, that
females login more frequently than males, and that student login
activity increases as the semester progresses. As a result, this study
shows that login activity can be used to predict the academic
performance of students. These findings suggest that educators in
traditional face-to-face classes can benefit from educational data
mining techniques that are applied to the data collected by learning
management systems in order to monitor student performance.},

@article{WOS:000551016900002,
 abstract = {In higher education, the initial studying period of each course plays a
crucial role for students, and seriously influences the subsequent
learning activities. However, given the large size of a course's
students at universities, it has become impossible for teachers to keep
track of the performance of individual students. In this circumstance,
an academic early warning system is desirable, which automatically
detects students with difficulties in learning (i.e., at-risk students)
prior to a course starting. However, previous studies are not well
suited to this purpose for two reasons: 1) they have mainly concentrated
on e-learning platforms, e.g., massive open online courses (MOOCs), and
relied on the data about students' online activities, which is hardly
accessed in traditional teaching scenarios; and 2) they have only made
performance prediction when a course is in progress or even close to the
end. In this paper, for traditional classroom-teaching scenarios, we
investigate the task of pre-course student performance prediction, which
refers to detecting at-risk students for each course before its
commencement. To better represent a student sample and utilize the
correlations among courses, we cast the problem as a multi-instance
multi-label (MIML) problem. Besides, given the problem of data scarcity,
we propose a novel multi-task learning method, i.e., MIML-Circle, to
predict the performance of students from different specialties in a
unified framework. Extensive experiments are conducted on five
real-world datasets, and the results demonstrate the superiority of our
approach over the state-of-the-art methods.},

 abstract = {This work proposes an innovative visual tool for real-time continuous
learners analytics. The purpose of the work is to improve the design,
functionality, and usability of learning management systems to monitor
user activity to allow educators to make informed decisions on
e-learning design, usually limited to dashboards graphs, tables, and
low-usability user logs. The standard visualisation is currently scarce,
and often inadequate to inform educators about the design quality and
students engagement on their learning objects. The same low usability
can be found in learning analytics tools, which mostly focus on
post-course analysis, demanding specific skills to be effectively used,
e.g., for statistical analysis and database queries. We propose a tool
for student analytics embedded in a Learning Management System, based on
the innovative visual metaphor of interface morphing. Artificial
intelligence provides in remote learning immediate feedback, crucial in
a face-to-face setting, highlighting the students' engagement in each
single learning object. A visual metaphor is the representation of a
person, group, learning object, or concept through a visual image that
suggests a particular association or point of similarity. The basic idea
is that elements of the application interface, e.g., learning objects'
icons and student avatars, can be modified in colour and dimension to
reflect key performance indicators of learner's activities. The goal is
to provide high-affordance information on the student engagement and
usage of learning objects, where aggregation functions on subsets of
users allow a dynamic evaluation of cohorts with different granularity.
The proposed visual metaphors (i.e., thermometer bar, dimensional
morphing, and tag cloud morphing) have been implemented and experimented
within academic-level courses. Experimental results have been evaluated
with a comparative analysis of user logs and a subjective usability
survey, which show that the tool obtains quantitative, measurable
effectiveness and the qualitative appreciation of educators. Among
metaphors, the highest success is obtained by Dimensional morphing and
Tag cloud transformation.},

 abstract = {While virtual reality has attracted educators' interest by providing new
opportunities to the learning process and assessment in different
science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) subjects, the
results from previous studies indicate that there is still much work to
be done when large data collection and analysis is considered. At the
same time, learning analytics emerged with the promise to revolutionise
the traditional practices by introducing new ways to systematically
assess and improve the effectiveness of instruction. However, the
collection of `big' educational data is mostly associated with web-based
platforms (i.e., learning management systems) as they offer direct
access to students' data with minimal effort. Thence, in the context of
this work, we present a four-dimensional theoretical framework for
virtual reality-supported instruction and propose a set of structural
elements that can be utilised in conjunction with a learning analytics
prototype system. The outcomes of this work are expected to support
practitioners on how to maximise the potential of their interventions
and provide further inspiration for the development of new ones.},

 abstract = {Learning management systems (LMSs) are ubiquitous components of the
academic technology experience for learners across a wide variety of
instructional contexts. Learners' interactions within an LMS are often
contingent upon how instructors architect a module, course, or program
of study. Patterns related to these learner interactions, often referred
to as learning analytics implementation (LAI), can be represented by
combining system-level LMS data with course-level design decisions to
inform more granular insights into learner behaviour. The purpose of
this paper is to use the LAI framework, specifically the principles of
coordination and comparison (Wise \& Vytasek, 2017), to examine how
learner interaction patterns associated with LMS-use variables
correspond to deliberate learning design decisions and course outcomes
for a group of courses in the same undergraduate writing program.
Visualizations of learner activity exhibited similar patterns of learner
engagement across courses, corroborating the observation that design
decisions heavily influence learner behaviour. Predictive analyses
demonstrated strong influence of LMS use on final grades while
accounting for course instructor. That is, while page views were not
related to final grade, the length of discussion entries was often
predictive. These results suggest that students who practised writing
more - the main learning objective of this course - had higher final
grades, regardless of variations in instructor and semester.},

 abstract = {The early prediction of students' performance is a valuable resource to
improve their learning. If we are able to detect at-risk students in the
initial stages of the course, we will have more time to improve their
performance. Likewise, excellent students could be motivated with
customized additional activities. This is why there are research works
aimed to early detect students' performance. Some of them try to achieve
it with the analysis of LMS log files, which store information about
student interaction with the LMS. Many works create predictive models
with the log files generated for the whole course, but those models are
not useful for early prediction because the actual log information used
for predicting is different to the one used to train the models. Other
works do create predictive models with the log information retrieved at
the early stages of courses, but they are just focused on a particular
type of course.
In this work, we use machine learning to create models for the early
prediction of students' performance in solving LMS assignments, by just
analyzing the LMS log files generated up to the moment of prediction.
Moreover, our models are course agnostic, because the datasets are
created with all the University of Oviedo(1) courses for one academic
year. We predict students' performance at 10\%, 25\%, 33\% and 50\% of
the course length. Our objective is not to predict the exact student's
mark in LMS assignments, but to detect at-risk, fail and excellent
students in the early stages of the course. That is why we create
different classification models for each of those three student groups.
Decision tree, nave Bayes, logistic regression, multilayer perceptron
(MLP) neural network, and support vector machine models are created and
evaluated. Accuracies of all the models grow as the moment of prediction
increases. Although all the algorithms but nave Bayes show accuracy
differences lower than 5\%, MLP obtains the best performance: from
80.1\% accuracy when 10\% of the course has been delivered to 90.1\%
when half of it has taken place. We also discuss the LMS log entries
that most influence the students' performance. By using a clustering
algorithm, we detect six different clusters of students regarding their
interaction with the LMS. Analyzing the interaction patterns of each
cluster, we find that those patterns are repeated in all the early
stages of the course. Finally, we show how four out of those six

 abstract = {Educational Data Science has meant an important advancement in the
understanding and improvemen of learning models in recent years. One of
the most relevant research topics is student performance prediction
through click-stream activity in virtual learning environments, which
provide abundant information about their behaviour during the course.
This work explores the potential of Deep Learning and Meta-Learning in
this field, which has thus far been explored very little, so that it can
serve as a basis for future studies. We implemented a predictive model
which is able to automatically optimise the architecture and
hyperparameters of a deep neural network, taking as a use case an
educational dataset that contains information from more than 500
students from an online university master's degree. The results show
that the performance of the autonomous model was similar to the
traditionally designed one, which offers significant benefits in terms
of efficiency and scalability. This also opens up interesting areas of
research related to Meta-Learning applied to educational Big Data.},

 abstract = {Monitoring students in Learning Management Systems (LMS) throughout the
teaching-learning process has been shown to be a very effective
technique for detecting students at risk. Likewise, the teaching style
in the LMS conditions, the type of student behaviours on the platform
and the learning outcomes. The main objective of this study was to test
the effectiveness of three teaching modalities (all using Online
Project-based Learning -OPBL- and Flipped Classroom experiences and
differing in the use of virtual laboratories and Intelligent Personal
Assistant -IPA-) on Moodle behaviour and student performance taking into
account the covariate ``collaborative group{''}. Both quantitative and
qualitative research methods were used. With regard to the quantitative
analysis, differences were found in student behaviour in Moodle and in
learning outcomes, with respect to teaching modalities that included
virtual laboratories. Similarly, the qualitative study also analysed the
behaviour patterns found in each collaborative group in the three
teaching modalities studied. The results indicate that the collaborative
group homogenises the learning outcomes, but not the behaviour pattern
of each member. Future research will address the analysis of
collaborative behaviour in LMSs according to different variables
(motivation and metacognitive strategies in students, number of members,
interactions between students and teacher in the LMS, etc.).},

 abstract = {Personalized or precision education (PE) considers the integration of
multimodal technologies to tailor individuals' learning experiences
based on their preferences and needs. To identify the impact that
emerging multimodal technologies have on personalized education, we
reviewed recent implementations and applications of systems (e.g.,
MOOCs, serious games, artificial intelligence, learning management
systems, mobile applications, augmented/virtual reality, classroom
technologies) that integrate such features. Our findings revealed that
PE techniques could leverage the instructional potential of educational
platforms and tools by facilitating students' knowledge acquisition and
skill development. The added value of PE is also extended beyond the
online digital learning context, as positive outcomes were also
identified in blended/face-to-face learning scenarios, with multiple
connections being discussed between the impact of PE on student
efficacy, achievement, and well-being. In line with the recommendations
and suggestions that supporters of PE make, we provide implications for
research and practice as well as ground for policy formulation and
reformation on how multimodal technologies can be integrated into the
educational context.},

 abstract = {Mathematics is the engine, vehicle, driver, and language of today's
initiatives, innovations, and human endeavors. In this
mathematical-driven world, the ability to perform mathematical tasks and
logical reasoning is also essential in solving quotidian tasks and
problems. Therefore, mathematical competency and problem-solving skills
are kept as an integral component in almost every educational curriculum
around the globe. However, there are numerous stumbling blocks along the
way to successful teaching, conducive learning environment, and good
student performances in almost all disciplines, but more prevalent and
visible in mathematics. The major concerns of educators responsible for
teaching mathematics and mathematics-related courses are to find
effective and innovative ways to deliver mathematical content, to extend
the concepts and theories beyond the classrooms, to integrate
mathematics with important concepts such as gamification, data mining,
learning analytics, deep learning, and effective tools such as mobile
devices, learning management systems, and digital technology, and to
maintain a good record of students' performance. In online deliveries,
these concerns are further escalated due to no or limited one-to-one
interactions and lack of face time, to mention a few. This article
investigates the efficacy and effectiveness of traditional and
innovative pedagogical practices used in online mathematic courses at
the University of the South Pacific (USP). It examines the
interdependence of embedded activities and students' achievement. The
results indicate that these online mathematics courses were highly
dominated by conventional approaches and were less interactive and
engaging, resulting in lower success rates when compared to the courses
from other disciplines. To recommend possible ways to enhance the
quality of learning and teaching in online mathematics courses, selected
online courses from the information system discipline were explored. The
reasons for the high online presence in the course were investigated and
activities that could lead to collaborative and active learning beyond
the passive materials were data mined. The evidence drawn from the
statistical analysis highlights the importance of including selected
interactive and engaging activities in online learning space of
mathematics courses to promote student engagement and help create a
sense of community among geographically dispersed students. Overall,
based on the observations and theoretical foundation from literature, it
can be said that including regular and frequent active assessment
strategies, such as weekly quizzes and discussion forums, could extend
and promote interactive and engaging learning in online learning space.},

 abstract = {Learners are expected to stay wakeful and focused while interacting with
e-learning platforms. Although wakefulness of learners strongly relates
to educational outcomes, detecting drowsy learning behaviors only from
log data is not an easy task. In this study, we describe the results of
our research to model learners' wakefulness based on multimodal data
generated from heart rate, seat pressure, and face recognition. We
collected multimodal data from learners in a blended course of
informatics and conducted two types of analysis on them. First, we
clustered features based on learners' wakefulness labels as generated by
human raters and ran a statistical analysis. This analysis helped us
generate insights from multimodal data that can be used to inform
learner and teacher feedback in multimodal learning analytics. Second,
we trained machine learning models with multiclass-Support Vector
Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF) and CatBoost Classifier (CatBoost)
algorithms to recognize learners' wakefulness states automatically. We
achieved an average macro-F1 score of 0.82 in automated user-dependent
models with CatBoost. We also showed that compared to unimodal data from
each sensor, the multimodal sensor data can improve the accuracy of
models predicting the wakefulness states of learners while they are
interacting with e-learning platforms.},

 abstract = {Electronic learning management systems provide live environments for
students and faculty members to connect with their institutional online
portals and perform educational activities virtually. Although modern
technologies proactively support these online sessions, students' active
participation remains a challenge that has been discussed in previous
research. Additionally, one concern for both parents and teachers is how
to accurately measure student performance using different attributes
collected during online sessions. Therefore, the research idea
undertaken in this study is to understand and predict the performance of
the students based on features extracted from electronic learning
management systems. The dataset chosen in this study belongs to one of
the learning management systems providing a number of features
predicting student's performance. The integrated machine learning model
proposed in this research can be useful to make proactive and
intelligent decisions according to student performance evaluated through
the electronic system's data. The proposed model consists of five
traditional machine learning algorithms, which are further enhanced by
applying four ensemble techniques: bagging, boosting, stacking, and
voting. The overall F1 scores of the single models are as follows: DT
(0.675), RF (0.777), GBT (0.714), NB (0.654), and KNN (0.664). The model
performance has shown remarkable improvement using ensemble approaches.
The stacking model by combining all five classifiers has outperformed
and recorded the highest F1 score (0.8195) among other ensemble methods.
The integration of the ML models has improved the prediction ratio and
performed better than all other ensemble approaches. The proposed model
can be useful for predicting student performance and helping educators
to make informed decisions by proactively notifying the students.},

 abstract = {The university curriculum is a systematic and organic study complex with
some immediate associated steps; the initial learning of each semester's
course is crucial, and significantly impacts the learning process of
subsequent courses and further studies. However, the low teacher-student
ratio makes it difficult for teachers to consistently follow up on the
detail-oriented learning situation of individual students. The extant
learning early warning system is committed to automatically detecting
whether students have potential difficulties-or even the risk of
failing, or non-pass reports-before starting the course. Previous
related research has the following three problems: first of all, it
mainly focused on e-learning platforms and relied on online activity
data, which was not suitable for traditional teaching scenarios;
secondly, most current methods can only proffer predictions when the
course is in progress, or even approaching the end; thirdly, few studies
have focused on the feature redundancy in these learning data. Aiming at
the traditional classroom teaching scenario, this paper transforms the
pre-class student performance prediction problem into a multi-label
learning model, and uses the attribute reduction method to
scientifically streamline the characteristic information of the courses
taken and explore the important relationship between the characteristics
of the previously learned courses and the attributes of the courses to
be taken, in order to detect high-risk students in each course before
the course begins. Extensive experiments were conducted on 10 real-world
datasets, and the results proved that the proposed approach achieves
better performance than most other advanced methods in multi-label
classification evaluation metrics.</p>},

 abstract = {Studies on the prediction of student success in distance learning have
explored mainly demographics factors and student interactions with the
virtual learning environments. However, it is remarkable that a very
limited number of studies use information about the assignments
submitted by students as influential factor to predict their academic
achievement. This paper aims to explore the real importance of
assignment information for solving students' performance prediction in
distance learning and evaluate the beneficial effect of including this
information. We investigate and compare this factor and its potential
from two information representation approaches: the traditional
representation based on single instances and a more flexible
representation based on Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), focus on
handle weakly labeled data. A comparative study is carried out using the
Open University Learning Analytics dataset, one of the most important
public datasets in education provided by one of the greatest online
universities of United Kingdom. The study includes a wide set of
different types of machine learning algorithms addressed from the two
data representation commented, showing that algorithms using only
information about assignments with a representation based on MIL can
outperform more than 20\% the accuracy with respect to a representation
based on single instance learning. Thus, it is concluded that applying
an appropriate representation that eliminates the sparseness of data
allows to show the relevance of a factor, such as the assignments
submitted, not widely used to date to predict students' academic
performance. Moreover, a comparison with previous works on the same
dataset and problem shows that predictive models based on MIL using only
assignments information obtain competitive results compared to previous
studies that include other factors to predict students performance.},

 abstract = {Learning analytics is an emerging technique of analysing student
participation and engagement. The recent COVID-19 pandemic has
significantly increased the role of learning management systems (LMSs).
LMSs previously only complemented face-to-face teaching, something which
has not been possible between 2019 to 2020. To date, the existing body
of literature on LMSs has not analysed learning in the context of the
pandemic, where an LMS serves as the only interface between students and
instructors. Consequently, productive results will remain elusive if the
key factors that contribute towards engaging students in learning are
not first identified. Therefore, this study aimed to perform an
extensive literature review with which to design and develop a student
engagement model for holistic involvement in an LMS. The required data
was collected from an LMS that is currently utilised by a local
Malaysian university. The model was validated by a panel of experts as
well as discussions with students. It is our hope that the result of
this study will help other institutions of higher learning determine
factors of low engagement in their respective LMSs.},

 abstract = {Virtual Learning Environments (VLE), such as Moodie and Blackboard,
store vast data to help identify students' performance and engagement.
As a result, researchers have been focusing their efforts on assisting
educational institutions in providing machine learning models to predict
at-risk students and to improve their performance. However, it requires
an efficient approach to construct a model that can ultimately provide
accurate predictions. Consequently, this study proposed a hybrid machine
learning framework to predict students' performance using eight
classification algorithms and three ensemble methods (Bagging, Boosting,
Voting) to determine the best-performing predictive model. In addition,
this study used filter-based and wrapper-based feature selection
techniques to select the best features of the dataset related to
students' performance. The obtained results reveal that the ensemble
methods recorded higher predictive accuracy when compared to single
classifiers. Furthermore, the accuracy of the models improved due to the
feature selection techniques utilized in this study.},

 abstract = {Prior to the emergence of Big Data and technologies such as Learning
Analytics (LA), classroom research focused mainly on measuring learning
outcomes of a small sample through tests. Research on online
environments shows that learners' engagement is a critical precondition
for successful learning and lack of engagement is associated with
failure and dropout. LA helps instructors to track, measure and
visualize students' online behavior and use such digital traces to
improve instruction and provide individualized support, i.e., feedback.
This paper examines 1) metrics or indicators of learners' engagement as
extracted and displayed by LA, 2) their relationship with academic
achievement and performance, and 3) some freely available LA tools for
instructors and their usability. The paper concludes with making
recommendations for practice and further research by considering
challenges associated with using LA in classrooms.},

 abstract = {Blended learning pedagogical practices supported by learning management
systems have become an important part of higher education curricula. In
most cases, these blended curricula are evaluated through multimodal
formative assessments. Although assessments can strongly affect student
outcomes, research on the topic is limited. In this paper, we adopted a
learning analytics approach to explore student engagement with formative
assessments and the power of these assessments to predict student
outcomes in an English for Academic Purposes courses in a Hong Kong
university. The study retrieved the data logs from 7,815 students and
used the data to analyze student engagement with the formative
assessments. The results suggested that the students put effort into
completing the assessments. The degree to which assessments predict
learning outcomes depend on students' level of subject knowledge and
their understanding of the relevance of the assessments. This study
showed that learning analytics provided reliable evidence for
understanding students' engagement and identifying at-risk students.
Therefore, learning analytics research has the potential to inform
pedagogical practice.},

 abstract = {Recent technological advancements in e-learning platforms have made it
easy to store and manage students' related data, such as personal
details, initial grade, intermediate grades, final grades, and many
other parameters. These data can be efficiently processed and analyzed
by intelligent techniques and algorithms to generate useful insights
into the students' performance, such as to identify the factors
impacting the progress of successful students or the performance of the
students who are struggling in their courses and are at risk of failing.
Such a framework is scarce in the current literature. This study
proposes an interpretable framework to generate useful insights from the
data produced by e-learning platforms using machine learning algorithms.
The proposed framework incorporates predictive models, as well as
regression and classification models to analyze multiple factors of
student performance. Classification models are used to systematize
normal and at-risk students based on their academic performance, with
high precision and accuracy. Regression analysis is performed to
determine the inherent linear and nonlinear relationships between the
academic outcomes of the students acting as the target or independent
variables and the performance indicative features acting as dependent
variables. For further analysis, a predictive modeling problem is
considered, where the performance of the students is anticipated based
on their commitment to a specific course, their performance for the
whole course, and their final grades. The efficiency of the proposed
framework is also optimized by reliably tuning the algorithmic
parameters. Furthermore, the performance is accelerated by empowering
the system with a GPU-based infrastructure. Results reveal that the
proposed interpretable framework is highly accurate and precise and can
identify factors that play a vital role in the students' success or
failure.},

 abstract = {As universities around the world have begun to use learning management
systems (LMSs), more learning data have become available to gain deeper
insights into students' learning processes and make data-driven
decisions to improve student learning. With the availability of rich
data extracted from the LMS, researchers have turned much of their
attention to learning analytics (LA) applications using educational data
mining techniques. Numerous LA models have been proposed to predict
student achievement in university courses. To design predictive LA
models, researchers often follow a data-driven approach that prioritizes
prediction accuracy while sacrificing theoretical links to learning
theory and its pedagogical implications. In this study, we argue that
instead of complex variables (e.g., event logs, clickstream data,
timestamps of learning activities), data extracted from online formative
assessments should be the starting point for building predictive LA
models. Using the LMS data from multiple offerings of an asynchronous
undergraduate course, we analysed the utility of online formative
assessments in predicting students' final course performance. Our
findings showed that the features extracted from online formative
assessments (e.g., completion, timestamps and scores) served as strong
and significant predictors of students' final course performance. Scores
from online formative assessments were consistently the strongest
predictor of student performance across the three sections of the
course. The number of clicks in the LMS and the time difference between
first access and due dates of formative assessments were also
significant predictors. Overall, our findings emphasize the need for
online formative assessments to build predictive LA models informed by
theory and learning design. Practitioner notes What is already known
about this topic Higher education institutions often use learning
analytics for the early identification of low-performing students or
students at risk of dropping out. Most predictive models in learning
analytics rely on immutable student characteristics (e.g., gender, race
and socioeconomic status) and complex variables extracted from log data
within a learning management system. Prioritizing prediction accuracy
without theory orientation often yields ``black-box{''} models that fail
to inform educators on what remedies need to be taken to improve student
learning. What this paper adds Predictive models in learning analytics
should consider learning theory, pedagogy and learning design to
identify key predictors of student learning. Online formative
assessments can be a starting point for building predictive models that
are not only accurate but also provide educators with actionable
insights on how student learning can be improved. Time-related and
score-related features extracted from online formative assessments are
particularly useful for predicting students' course performance.
Implications for practice and/or policy This study provides strong
evidence for using online formative assessments as the foundation for
predictive models in learning analytics. Student data from online
formative assessments can help educators provide students with feedback
while informing future formative assessment cycles. Higher education
institutions should avoid the hype around complex data from learning
management systems and instead rely on effective learning tools such as
online formative assessments to revolutionize the use of learning
analytics.},

 abstract = {Learning analytics aims at helping the students to attain their learning
goals. The predictions in learning analytics are made to enhance the
effectiveness of educational interferences. This study predicts student
engagement at an early phase of a Virtual Learning Environment (VLE)
course by analyzing data collected from consecutive years. The
prediction model is developed using machine learning techniques applied
to a subset of Open University Learning Analytics Dataset, provided by
Open University (OU), Britain. The investigated data belongs to 7,775
students who attended social science courses for consecutive assessment
years. The experiments are conducted with a reduced feature set to
predict whether the students are highly or lowly engaged in the courses.
The attributes indicating students' interaction with the VLE, their
scores, and final results are the most contributing variables for the
predictive analysis. Based on these variables, a reduced feature vector
is constructed. The baseline used in the study is the linear regression
model. The model's best results showed 95\% accurate, 95\% precise, and
98\% relevant results with the Random Forest classification algorithm.
Early prediction's relevant features are a subset of click activities,
which provided a functional interface between the students and the VLE.},

 abstract = {Student performance predictive analysis has played a vital role in
education in recent years. It allows for the understanding students'
learning behaviours, the identification of at-risk students, and the
development of insights into teaching and learning improvement.
Recently, many researchers have used data collected from Learning
Management Systems to predict student performance. This study
investigates the potential of clickstream data for this purpose. A total
of 5341 sample students and their click behaviour data from the OULAD
(Open University Learning Analytics Dataset) are used. The raw
clickstream data are transformed, integrating the time and activity
dimensions of students' click actions. Two feature sets are extracted,
indicating the number of clicks on 12 learning sites based on weekly and
monthly time intervals. For both feature sets, the experiments are
performed to compare deep learning algorithms (including LSTM and
1D-CNN) with traditional machine learning approaches. It is found that
the LSTM algorithm outperformed other approaches on a range of
evaluation metrics, with up to 90.25\% accuracy. Four out of twelve
learning sites (content, subpage, homepage, quiz) are identified as
critical in influencing student performance in the course. The insights
from these critical learning sites can inform the design of future
courses and teaching interventions to support at-risk students.},

 abstract = {Predicting student performance is crucial in higher education, as it
facilitates course selection and the development of appropriate future
study plans. The process of supporting the instructors and supervisors
in monitoring students in order to upkeep them and combine training
programs to get the best outcomes. It decreases the official warning
signs and inefficient students' expulsions. Therefore, analysis of
students' performance on various academic tests is critical for future
skill development. Despite the fact that existing performance prediction
systems based on Deep Learning (DL) technologies such as Artificial
Neural Networks (ANN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) have outperformed
Machine Learning (ML) -based systems in the prediction task, there are
still a few issues. Ignorance of relevant features, analysis limitations
to the existing amount of data points, and ambiguity in student records
are only a few of these issues. This research proposes a novel Student
Academic Performance Predicting (SAPP) system to address these issues
and enhance prediction accuracy. It has a better architecture that uses
a combination of 4-layer stacked Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network,
Random Forest (RF), and Gradient Boosting (GB) techniques to predict
students' pass or fail outcomes. Additionally, the proposed SAPP system
is compared to existing prediction systems using publicly accessible
student OULAD dataset with an addition of self-curated emotional
dataset. The performance of SAPP system is measured using Accuracy,
Precision, F-measure, and Recall parameters. The results of proposed
algorithm (LSTM + RF + B) is compared with LSTM + RF, LSTM + B and end
to end DL models such as ANN, LSTM, RNN, Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) and most commonly utilized ML models in the literature such as
Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), Naive Bayes (NB) and
RF. The proposed SAPP system gained approximately 96\% prediction
accuracy that is comparatively higher than existing systems.},

 abstract = {Learning management systems (LMSs) have been used massively due to the
growing utilization of distance learning. This advancement has led to
increased educational data that can be analyzed to improve the quality
of the learning process. Learning analytics (LA) is one of the most
important methods that can be used to analyze student performance. In
this paper, we proposed an LA method based on deep learning, i.e.,
transformer encoder, to sequentially predict the student's final
performance based on log activities provided by an LMS. The objective is
to predict at-risk students of failing so that they can be mitigated as
soon as possible. The proposed model was evaluated on the Open
University LA Dataset (OULAD) for daily or weekly prediction. The
results show that the model could predict at the early stage with an
accuracy of 83.17\% on withdrawn versus pass-distinction classes.
Meanwhile, for the other tasks, i.e., withdrawn-fail versus
pass-distinction and fail versus pass-distinction tasks, the accuracy
was at least 76\% at the early stage. The proposed model was compared to
the LSTM model. We found that the transformer encoder performed better
than the LSTM, with the average difference values from 1\% to 3\% in
terms of accuracy and from 3\% to 7\% in terms of F1-score for all
tasks, based on the statistical testing. Furthermore, the ablation study
using positional encoding, different feature aggregation methods, and
weighted loss function for the imbalanced class problem was conducted.
In OULAD, we found that model without positional encoding was better in
all cases. Furthermore, the weekly feature aggregation and the use of a
weighted loss function performed better in some cases.},

 abstract = {Technological advances have significantly affected education, leading to
the creation of online learning platforms such as virtual learning
environments and massive open online courses. While these platforms
offer a variety of features, none of them incorporates a module that
accurately predicts students' academic performance and commitment.
Consequently, it is crucial to design machine learning (ML) methods that
predict student performance and identify at-risk students as early as
possible. Graph representations of student data provide new insights
into this area. This paper describes a simple but highly accurate
technique for converting tabulated data into graphs. We employ distance
measures (Euclidean and cosine) to calculate the similarities between
students' data and construct a graph. We extract graph topological
features (GF) to enhance our data. This allows us to capture structural
correlations among the data and gain deeper insights than isolated data
analysis. The initial dataset (DS) and GF can be used alone or jointly
to improve the predictive power of the ML method. The proposed method is
tested on an educational dataset and returns superior results. The use
of DS alone is compared with the use of DS + GF in the classification of
students into three classes: ``failed{''},{''}at risk{''}, and
``good{''}. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
(AUC) reaches 0.948 using DS, compared with 0.964 for DS + GF. The
accuracy in the case of DS + GF varies from 84.5 to 87.3\%. Adding GF
improves the performance by 2.019\% in terms of AUC and 3.261\% in terms
of accuracy. Moreover, by incorporating graph topological features
through a graph convolutional network (GCN), the prediction performance
can be enhanced by 0.5\% in terms of accuracy and 0.9\% in terms of AUC
under the cosine distance matrix. With the Euclidean distance matrix,
adding the GCN improves the prediction accuracy by 3.7\% and the AUC by
2.4\%. By adding graph embedding features to ML models, at-risk students
can be identified with 87.4\% accuracy and 0.97 AUC. The proposed
solution provides a tool for the early detection of at-risk students.
This will benefit universities and enhance their prediction performance,
improving both effectiveness and reputation.},

 abstract = {Digital advances in the learning space have changed the contours of
student engagement as well as how it is measured. Learning management
systems and other learning technologies now provide information about
student behaviors with course materials in the form of learning
analytics. In the context of a large, integrated and interdisciplinary
Core curriculum course in a graduate school of public health, this study
undertook a pilot randomized controlled trial testing the effect of
providing a ``behavioral nudge{''} in the form of digital images
containing specific information derived from learning analytics about
past student behaviors and performance. The study found that student
engagement varied significantly from week to week, but nudges linking
coursework completion to assessment grade performance did not
significantly change student engagement. While the a priori hypotheses
of this pilot trial were not upheld, this study yielded significant
findings that can guide future efforts to increase student engagement.
Future work should include a robust qualitative assessment of student
motivations, testing of nudges that tap into these motivations and a
richer examination of student learning behaviors over time using
stochastic analyses of data from the learning management system.},

 abstract = {Learning Analytics aims to discover the class of students' performance
over time. This helps in-structors make in-time interventions but,
discovering the students' performance class in virtual learning
environments consider a challenge due to distance constraints. Many
studies, which applied to Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) datasets,
built predictive models but, these models were applied to specific
courses and students and classify students into binary classes.
Moreover, their results were obtained at the end of the course period
thus delaying making in -time interventions. To bridge this gap, this
study proposes a day-wise multi-class model to pre-dict students'
performance using Artificial Neural Network and Long Short-Term Memory,
named ANN-LSTM. To check the validity of this model, two baseline
models, the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Gated Recurrent Unit
(GRU), were conducted and compared with ANN-LSTM in this context.
Additionally, the results of ANN-LSTM were compared with the
state-of-the-art models in terms of accuracy. The results show that the
ANN-LSTM model obtained the best re-sults among baseline models. The
accuracy obtained by ANN-LSTM was about 70\% at the end of the third
month of the course and outperforms RNN and GRU models which obtained
53\% and 57\%, respectively. Also, the ANN-LSTM model obtained the best
accuracy results with enhancement rates of about 6-14\% when compared
with state-of-the-art models. This highlights the ability of LSTM as a
time series model to make early predictions for student performance in
MOOC taking benefit of its architecture and ability to keep latent
dependencies.},

 abstract = {Today, educational institutions produce large amounts of data with the
deployment of learning management systems. These large datasets provide
an untapped potential to support and enhance decision-making and
operations. In recent times, machine learning (ML) has been applied to
develop models utilizing this ``big{''} data to assist in
decision-making. This study presents a systematic literature review into
the application of ML to predict student performance. A total of 162
research articles from January 2010 to October 2022 were critically
reviewed and analyzed by applying Kitchenham's systematic literature
review approach. Our analysis categorized the literature predicting
students' academic performance into two categories: (i) predicting
student performance in assessments, courses or programs, and identifying
students at-risk of failing their course/program (129 studies); and (ii)
predicting student dropout or retention in a course or program (33
studies). Classification is the most commonly used approach for
predicting student performance (138 studies), followed by regression (25
studies) and clustering (9 studies). Supervised learning methods are
used more often than semi-supervised learning. Five most popular ML
algorithms include the Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes,
Artificial Neural Network, and Support Vector Machine. Historical
records of students' grades and class performance, academic related data
from learning management systems, and students' demographics are the
most common features used for predicting students' performance. The most
common methods used for feature selection are Information Gain-based
selection algorithms, Correlation-based feature selection, and Gain
Ratio. The general platforms/tools/libraries used in the studies include
WEKA, Python, R, Rapid Miner, and MATLAB. We also investigated possible
actions considered in the literature to help at-risk students. We only
found very few studies that deployed remedial actions and evaluated
their impact on students' performance. In conclusion, ML has shown great
potential in the prediction of student performance, but also has many
areas of further research.},

 abstract = {E-learning platforms have become increasingly popular across various
industries, with higher education institutions being among the primary
adopters. Learning management sys-tems (LMSs) have emerged as valuable
tools that facilitate the management of learning and training processes
while providing support for learning administration. However, LMS
plat-forms often offer limited functionality for monitoring students'
instructional progress, which is essential for understanding how
learners interact with courses and materials. As a result, identifying
at-risk students, tracking their progress, and intervening when
necessary can be challenging. The substantial amount of data generated
by LMS platforms can be transformed into meaningful indicators that
allow for monitoring learners' progress and enhancing their
self-regulation. Our research project focuses on developing a set of
pedagogical indicators using learning analytics to monitor students'
progress. We present a case study where we tracked and monitored the
progress of students in the Web Technologies course on the e-campus
platform at Cadi Ayyad University (Morocco), using a set of student
performance indicators (SPIs). The findings of this study suggest that
employing SPIs can help faculty mem- bers identify underperforming
students, project their progress, and anticipate those at risk,
ultimately enabling them to provide timely interventions to support
learners' progress.},

 abstract = {In recent years, the application of data mining techniques on
educational data has grown in importance. Educational data mining can be
used to find hidden patterns in students' academic conduct and predict
future success by examining previous data. Because more technical tools
are being used to enhance the learning environment, including learning
management systems (LMS), the importance of educational data mining is
growing for educational institutions. The purpose of this study is to
employ data mining techniques to analyse pupil behaviour patterns and
predict how well they would perform academically. According to the
findings of this study, there is a considerable correlation between
student performance and a number of different factors, such as resource
(page) views, activity gaps, grades from the previous semester, grades
from prerequisite courses, and evaluations of first-term tests. Teachers
and educators can use this study to spot students who need extra
assistance so they can intervene.},

 abstract = {The high dropout rates in programming courses emphasise the need for
monitoring and understanding student engagement, enabling early
interventions. This activity can be supported by insights into students'
learning behaviours and their relationship with academic performance,
derived from student learning log data in learning management systems.
However, the high dimensionality of such data, along with their numerous
features, pose challenges to their analysis and interpretability. In
this study, we introduce entropy-based metrics as a novel manner to
represent students' learning behaviours. Employing these metrics, in
conjunction with a proven community detection method, we undertake an
analysis of learning behaviours across higher- and lower-performing
student communities. Furthermore, we examine the impact of the COVID-19
pandemic on these behaviours. The study is grounded in the analysis of
empirical data from 391 Software Engineering students over three
academic years. Our findings reveal that students in higher-performing
communities typically tend to have lower volatility in entropy values
and reach stable learning states earlier than their lower-performing
counterparts. Importantly, this study provides evidence of the use of
entropy as a simple yet insightful metric for educators to monitor study
progress, enhance understanding of student engagement, and enable timely
interventions.},

 abstract = {During the context of COVID-19, educational processes migrated to a
strictly virtual scenario, so the quantity of information grew in such a
way that techniques such as data mining or machine learning contributed
to generating knowledge for decision-making. In this sense, it is
relevant to define the state of the art of the contributions of data
mining in the university environment, and from there, to see in
perspective how these could be applied in scenarios of return to the
face-to-face. In this sense, a systematic review of the literature is
carried out, based on scientific evidence extracted from the Taylor \&
Francis, ERIC and Scopus data- bases. A qualitative content analysis
approach and the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement were used to extract the findings
published in scientific articles. The results were that educational data
mining was applied to a greater extent in the field of ``teaching{''},
and it was focused on the search for patterns and predictive models to
improve student performance, reduce student dropout, improve the
student's qual-ity of life, and teacher performance. In addition, as a
resource for data extraction, university learning management systems
(LMS) were used to a greater extent. It is concluded that tools such as
data mining should be implemented as academic management policies,
achieving a prospective on indicators linked to the improvement of
student learning and performance.},

 abstract = {Predicting student performance automatically is of utmost importance,
due to the substantial volume of data within educational databases.
Educational data mining (EDM) devises techniques to uncover insights
from data originating in educational settings. Artificial intelligence
(AI) can mine educational data to predict student performance and
provide measures to help students avoid failing and learn better.
Learning platforms complement traditional learning settings by analyzing
student performance, which can help reduce the chance of student
failure. Existing methods for student performance prediction in
educational data mining faced challenges such as limited accuracy,
imbalanced data, and difficulties in feature engineering. These issues
hindered effective adaptability and generalization across diverse
educational contexts. This study proposes a machine learning-based
system with deep convoluted features for the prediction of students'
academic performance. The proposed framework is employed to predict
student academic performance using balanced as well as, imbalanced
datasets using the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). In
addition, the performance is also evaluated using the original and deep
convoluted features. Experimental results indicate that the use of deep
convoluted features provides improved prediction accuracy compared to
original features. Results obtained using the extra tree classifier with
convoluted features show the highest classification accuracy of 99.9\%.
In comparison with the state-of-the-art approaches, the proposed
approach achieved higher performance. This research introduces a
powerful AI-driven system for student performance prediction, offering
substantial advancements in accuracy compared to existing approaches.},

 abstract = {The rapid evolution of e-learning platforms, propelled by advancements
in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), presents a
transformative potential in education. This dynamic landscape
necessitates an exploration of AI/ML integration in adaptive learning
systems to enhance educational outcomes. This study aims to map the
current utilization of AI/ML in e-learning for adaptive learning,
elucidating the benefits and challenges of such integration and
assessing its impact on student engagement, retention, and performance.
A comprehensive literature review was conducted, focusing on articles
published from 2010 onwards, to document the integration of AI/ML in
e-learning. The review analyzed 63 articles, employing a systematic
approach to evaluate the deployment of adaptive learning algorithms and
their educational implications. Findings reveal that AI/ML algorithms
are instrumental in personalizing learning experiences. These
technologies have been shown to optimize learning paths, enhance
engagement, and improve academic performance, with some studies
reporting increased test scores. The integration of AI/ML in e-learning
platforms significantly contributes to the personalization and
effectiveness of the educational process. Despite challenges like data
privacy and the complexity of AI/ML systems, the results underscore the
potential of adaptive learning to revolutionize education by catering to
individual learner needs.},

 abstract = {E -learning platforms have become increasingly popular in K-8 education
to promote student learning and enhance classroom teaching. Student
interactions with these platforms produce trace data, which are digital
records of learning processes. Although trace data have been effective
in identifying learners' engagement profiles in higher education and
lifelong learning (e.g., MOOCs), similar research on young learners has
been very scarce. This study makes a timely and novel contribution to
the field by identifying emerging profiles of young students from Grades
1 to 8 based on their engagement in an e -learning platform. The k
-means cluster analysis yielded seven distinct profiles in total. While
the dominance of profiles differed across grade levels, some profiles
were not even present at specific grades, indicating the changing
engagement behaviours of young learners in different years. In addition,
all emerging profiles suggest students tended to focus on specific
components of the platform, thus lacking balanced engagement with all
resources. In particular, while primary school students showed
relatively higher interest in game -based learning, middle school
students focused more on exams than their counterparts. The findings
yielded seven specific considerations for the design of effective e

 abstract = {Education is crucial for a productive life and providing necessary
resources. With the advent of technology like artificial intelligence,
higher education institutions are incorporating technology into
traditional teaching methods. Predicting academic success has gained
interest in education as a strong academic record improves a
university's ranking and increases student employment opportunities.
Modern learning institutions face challenges in analyzing performance,
providing high-quality education, formulating strategies for evaluating
students' performance, and identifying future needs. E-learning is a
rapidly growing and advanced form of education, where students enroll in
online courses. Platforms like Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS),
learning management systems (LMS), and massive open online courses
(MOOC) use educational data mining (EDM) to develop automatic grading
systems, recommenders, and adaptative systems. However, e-learning is
still considered a challenging learning environment due to the lack of
direct interaction between students and course instructors. Machine
learning (ML) is used in developing adaptive intelligent systems that
can perform complex tasks beyond human abilities. Some areas of
applications of ML algorithms include cluster analysis, pattern
recognition, image processing, natural language processing, and medical
diagnostics. In this research work, K-means, a clustering data mining
technique using Davies' Bouldin method, obtains clusters to find
important features affecting students' performance. The study found that
the SVM algorithm had the best prediction results after parameter
adjustment, with a 96\% accuracy rate. In this paper, the researchers
have examined the functions of the Support Vector Machine, Decision
Tree, naive Bayes, and KNN classifiers. The outcomes of parameter
adjustment greatly increased the accuracy of the four prediction models.
Na \& iuml;ve Bayes model's prediction accuracy is the lowest when
compared to other prediction methods, as it assumes a strong independent
relationship between features.},

 abstract = {Research on the relationship between the digital traces of students in
Learning Management Systems (LMS) and their academic performance has
traditionally been an area of interest in the field of learning
analytics. Aiming at achieving high interpretability and
generalizability, this study reviews past research, defines a new
categorization scheme for interactions in LMS and investigates the
relationships between clickstream data of students' activity and course
performance, measured as final grade. The results of the multiple
regression analysis of Moodle log data collected from three courses of
diverse nature using various classifications of interactions suggest
that the new categorization, the CILC (Classification of Interactions
based on the Learning Cycle), improves the explanatory power when
compared to previous classifications. The analysis suggests that the
predictive ability of the models could depend on the delivery mode, with
predictions improving as the delivery mode transitions from face -to
-face learning to online learning. This finding highlights the need for
context-specific considerations about the learning process. Compared to
previous research, the analysis also reveals nuances that suggest that
the relationships may depend on the instructional design. Finally, the
findings also seem to support the notion that increased data quantity
and quality may improve predictive models. In summary, the study
contributes with valuable insights into the interplay between LMS
interactions, course delivery mode, instructional design, and academic
performance, and advocates for a balanced exploration of white -box and
black -box modeling approaches in learning analytics research.},

 abstract = {Learning management systems (LMSs) are ubiquitous in higher education,
yet few studies have examined changes in student engagement online with
year level. Using data mining of LMSs, we examined the frequency and
timing with which first, second, and third year science students
accessed the various LMS resources. We compared online access with both
attendance and performance. The findings demonstrated that students of
all year levels showed a preference for lecture slides over recordings,
although there was a marked increase in engagement with year level. For
all students, the pattern of engagement with online resources was
largely a function of motivation and exam anxiety-students accessed the
LMS most frequently in the final three weeks of semester. Finally,
attendance was predictive of performance only for first year students,
with this demonstrating that approaches are required especially for
these students to increase engagement. This study has shown that
engagement can vary across year levels and should be considered when
designing teaching and learning activities.},

 abstract = {educational outcomes across varied institutions like universities,
schools, and training centers necessitates accurately predicting student
performance. These systems aggregates the data from multiple
sources-exam centers, virtual courses, registration departments, and
e-learning platforms. Analyzing this complex and diverse educational
data is a challenge, thus necessitating the application of machine
learning techniques. Utilizing machine learning algorithms for
dimensionality reduction simplifies intricate datasets, enabling more
comprehensive analysis. Through machine learning, educational data is
refined, uncovering valuable patterns and forecasts by simplifying
complexities via feature selection and dimensionality reduction methods.
This refinement significantly amplifies the efficacy of student
performance prediction systems, empowering educators and institutions
with data-driven insights and thereby enriching the overall educational
landscape. In this particular research, the Decision Tree Classification
(DTC) model is used for forecasting student performance. DTC stands out
as a potent machine-learning method for classification purposes. Two
optimization algorithms, namely the Fox Optimization (FO) and the Black
Widow Optimization (BWO), are integrated to heighten the model's
accuracy and efficiency further. The amalgamation of DTC with these
pioneering optimization techniques underscores the study's dedication to
harnessing the forefront of machine learning and bio-inspired
algorithms, ensuring more precise and resilient predictions of student
performance, ultimately culminating in improved educational outcomes.
From the results garnered for G1 and G3, it is evident that the DTBW

and categorizing G1, achieving an Accuracy and Precision value of 93.7

 abstract = {Technology-enhanced learning supported by virtual learning environments
(VLEs) facilitates tutors and students. VLE platforms contain a wealth
of information that can be used to mine insight regarding students'
learning behaviour and relationships between behaviour and academic
performance, as well as to model data-driven decision-making. This study
introduces a system that we termed ASIST: a novel Attention-aware
convolutional Stacked BiLSTM network for student representation learning
to predict their performance. ASIST exploits student academic registry,
VLE click stream, and midterm continuous assessment information for
their behaviour representation learning. ASIST jointly learns the
student representation using five behaviour vectors. It processes the
four sequential behaviour vectors using a separate stacked bidirectional
long short term memory (LSTM) network. A deep convolutional neural
network models the diurnal weekly interaction behaviour. It also employs
the attention mechanism to assign weight to features based on their
importance. Next, five encoded feature vectors are concatenated with the
assessment information, and, finally, a softmax layer predicts the
high-performer (H), moderate-performer (M), and at-risk (F) categories
of students. We evaluate ASIST over three datasets from an Irish
university, considering five evaluation metrics. ASIST achieves an area
under the curve (AUC) score of 0.86 to 0.90 over the three datasets. It
outperforms three baseline deep learning models and four traditional
classification models. We also found that the attention mechanism has a
slight impact on ASIST's performance. The ablation analysis reveals that
weekly event count has the greatest impact on ASIST, whereas diurnal
weekly interaction has the least impact. The early prediction using the
first seven weeks of data achieves an AUC of 0.83 up to 0.89 over the
three datasets. In yearly analysis, ASIST performs best over the 2018/19
dataset and worst over the 2020/21 dataset.},

 abstract = {Good recommendation for difficulty exercises can effectively help to point the students/users in the right direction, and potentially empower their learning interests. It is however challenging to select the exercises with reasonable difficulty for students as they have different learning status and the size of exercise bank is quite large. The classic collaborative filtering (CF) based recommendation methods rely heavily on the similarities among students or exercises, leading to recommend exercises with mismatched difficulty. This paper proposes a novel exercise recommendation method, which uses Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to predict the coverage of knowledge concepts, and uses Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT) to predict students’ mastery level of knowledge concepts based on the student’s exercise answer records. The predictive results are utilized to filter the exercises; therefore, a subset of exercise bank is generated. As such, a complete list of recommended exercises can be obtained by solving an optimization problem. Extensive experimental studies show that our proposed approach has advantages over some existing baseline methods, not only in terms of the evaluation of difficulty of recommended exercises, but also the diversity and novelty of the recommendation lists.},

 abstract = {Statistics is one of the most challenging courses for university students. The personal learning environment (PLE) pedagogical design was introduced to assist students' Statistics learning. With the PLE pedagogy, this study examined learners' demographic backgrounds, motivational measures (i.e., help-seeking and academic procrastination due to the use of Information and Communication Technologies, ICT), and ill-structured data (i.e., Facebook posts and comments) to understand what student demographic information, how they feel, and what they do can impact their statistics learning performance. Seventy-eight people joined Facebook groups to form statistics learning communities. Using weakly supervised machine learning (ML), we categorized students' Facebook messages into statistics-relevant and statistics-irrelevant. Results of the learning analytics on multimodal sources of student data showed that help-seeking positively predicted statistics achievement. In contrast, academic procrastination with ICT negatively predicted statistics achievement, controlling for students' demographics information, including age, gender, prior knowledge, and Internet/social media use. Moreover, the ensemble ML classified messages constructed by taking the sum of relevance coding (0 or 1) across three selected ML algorithms was highly aligned with the human coded message in terms of the degree of relevance to statistics. The ensemble ML classified messages were conceptualized as students’ cognitive engagement in statistics learning due to their high consistency with the human-labeled relevance coding and were positively associated with statistics achievement with a large effect size. The study contributed to developing an integrated learner-centered learning analytics framework with the PLE pedagogical design encompassing learner backgrounds and unstructured learner artifacts.},

 abstract = {Despite research confirming the positive impact of flipped jigsaw learning across multiple disciplines, little attention has been paid to embedding formative assessment into flipped jigsaw learning to optimize the acquisition of practical skills needed for future professional careers and promote learning engagement and higher-order thinking skills (HOTS). This study aimed to investigate the incorporation of formative assessment into a flipped jigsaw learning context and examine its effects on learning engagement and HOTS in an undergraduate business marketing course. A quasi-experimental design was used in this study, with two groups: control with flipped jigsaw learning and traditional summative assessment and experimental with flipped jigsaw learning and formative assessment. Each group consisted of 25 students, all enrolled in the undergraduate business administration department at an Indonesian vocational tertiary education institution. Questionnaires and student assignment scores were used to collect data. According to the findings, flipped jigsaw learning with extended formative assessment improved learning engagement and HOTS more than flipped jigsaw learning with traditional summative assessment. This study's findings may contribute to advancing theories and practices on how formative assessment has recently been explored as a learning tool embedded in flipped jigsaw learning in international business education.},

 abstract = {Video learning is a crucial component in flipped learning related to learners' readiness to attend more complex face-to-face activities. However, instructors may not know students' preparedness and motivation for each class. This study intended to examine the underlying mechanism between students' before-class video-viewing engagement and performance. We investigated learners' motivation (i.e., autonomous and controlled motivation) based on self-determination theory and controlled for their gender, age, and prior performance. An integrated temporal model was built under the dynamic structural equation modeling framework. Participants were 118 Taiwanese graduate students (78 females and 40 males) with a mean age of 26.14 years old. Study findings showed that students engage with the video content in a consistent viewing pattern, which has a significant relationship with their motivation and academic performance from week to week. The frequency of skipping backward was negatively associated with controlled motivation, while the frequency of pauses was positively associated with autonomous and controlled motivation. A high frequency of skipping forward predicted lower learning performance. Besides, a higher ratio of skipping backward predicted higher controlled motivation. Male students, older students, and students with higher prior performance exhibited higher autonomous motivation, which was related to better learning performance. Understanding these relationships can help educators and instructional designers develop more effective strategies for fostering students’ preparedness, engagement and success in active learning contexts. The study findings were discussed considering theoretical advancement and practical implications for enhancing personalized and active learning in higher education to achieve educational equity.},

 abstract = {The online discussion format has proven itself to be useful for promoting student collaboration and for accomplishing better learning outcomes. As a popular instant message software in China, WeChat has been commonly adopted for supporting academic group discussions. Many studies have explored how teacher facilitation affects students' learning performance in the synchronous or asynchronous discussion settings. However, the conclusions are not consistent and there is relative less research about the effects of teacher role on student engagement in the context of online discussion using the semi-synchronous tool-WeChat. This study began by identifying three dimensions of student engagement: behavioral engagement, cognitive engagement, and emotional engagement. A quasi-experiment was then conducted to compare student engagement among experiment groups (with teacher facilitation) and control groups (without teacher facilitation). A total of 46 college students were divided into eight groups and asked to discuss two specific topic tasks. To evaluate participants' behavioral and cognitive engagement, this study used a more objective data analysis method by applying content analysis rather than only based on surveys. Participants were required to complete a questionnaire to report their emotional engagement. The results show the behavioral and cognitive engagement of the experimental group with teacher facilitation were significantly higher than that of the control group without teacher facilitation. However, there was no significant effect of teacher facilitation on participants’ emotional engagement in the experimental group. It is also found that the emerging student leaders show similar positive effects of teacher facilitation towards improving behavioral and cognitive engagement. Future studies about the moderating effects of teaching experience and student leaders are also needed.},

 abstract = {This study evaluates several machine learning models used in predicting student performance. The data utilized in this study was collected from 253 undergraduate students participating in five classes within one of three courses offered by VnCodelab, an interactive learning management system, to provide insights into student performance. Leveraging the data-rich environment of the interactive learning management system proposed earlier, this study focuses on training a predictive model that forecasts student grades based on the comprehensive data collected during the teaching process. The proposed model capitalizes on the data obtained from students' engagement patterns, time spent on exercises, and progress tracking across learning activities. This study compared five different base classifiers— Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naïve Bayes (NB), and k-nearest Neighbor (k-NN), and an ensemble learning method Stacking Classifier —utilizing a dataset comprising 13 features. The research assesses the model's accuracy, reliability, and implications, contributing to the evolution of educational evaluation by introducing predictive assessment as a transformative tool. The results indicate that the Stacking Classifier accurately predicts students' grade ranges, surpassing individual base classification models by effectively combining their predictive capabilities. Integrating data-driven forecasting into the educational ecosystem can transform teaching methodologies and foster an informed, engaged, and empowered learning environment. This approach cultivates a proactive learning community by empowering students with real-time academic progress forecasts. Educators benefit from data-informed insights that facilitate more effective and objective performance evaluation.},

The success and usefulness of chatbots in the educational setting are highly dependent on teachers' beliefs regarding their efficacy, yet most research focuses on the effects on students' learning. Only a few studies have investigated teachers’ beliefs regarding the use of chatbots, which is considered an important issue. Owning to teachers' beliefs having been transformed from their pre-service teacher training, this study used quantitative (i.e., questionnaires), qualitative (i.e., interview), and evidence-based (i.e., behavioral analysis) methods to investigate pre-service teachers' learning perceptions and intentions about using chatbots for learning during their training phases. The results of this study revealed that learning perceptions did not reflect pre-service teachers' propensity to use chatbots, but the behavioral analysis uncovered some specific intentions for using chatbots. We further discuss these findings to provide recommendations for the future development of chatbots use in education.},

With the objective to assess the quality and adoptability of education supply chain, a novel analytical evaluation model approach is proposed, based on quality function deployment and combinative distance-based assessment. To deal with uncertainty in the evaluation process, fuzzy theory is integrated into the model. To establish the house of quality matrix, technology-based stakeholders' requirements were identified and classified in four dimensions: economic and financial, technology adoption, sustainability, competencies. Moreover, nine supplier criteria were assumed. Based on expert evaluations, the results suggest that financial credit and supplier collaboration are the most prominent attributes to evaluate suppliers, while environmental commitment is sorted as the least important criterion. The results reveal that the three dominant suppliers, which provide the best response to the identified criteria, are providers of cloud service technology.},

These systems present the learning content and materials to all learners attending the course in the same way and fail to offer individualized instruction that recognizes the individual differences and needs of the learners. It is reported that such problems can be eliminated by making the new generation intelligent learning systems. However, there is still an ongoing search for making such systems intelligent and a conceptual discussion concerning them. Integrating an intelligent tutoring system (ITS) with learning analytics, this study seeks to design and present the framework of an ITS with open access that a) identifies the learning needs of learners through adaptive mastery testing and guides learners based on these needs, b) overcomes learning deficiencies, monitors learners' interactions with content through learning analytics and offers suggestions, c) supports learning with dynamic assessment processes and d) tests learners’ learning competencies. This article aims to explain the conceptual and system framework for the design of an adaptive, dynamic, intelligent tutoring system (SMIT), supported by learning analytics, which is a product of the project, which aims to integrate LMS and ITS, on the idea of how to make systems such as MOOCs smarter. In line with the findings obtained from the research, various suggestions were made for the design of smart Moocs.},

 abstract = {This study aims to investigate whether deliberate computer-assisted argument mapping practices are effective for promoting pre-service teachers' critical thinking and helping them make better arguments over time within a fourteen-week online undergraduate course. A design-based study nested within a factorial repeated measures design with a single group of pre-service teachers is conducted to fulfill this aim. Thirty-eight junior pre-service teachers, enrolled in an early childhood education department at a middle-sized university in Turkey, were recruited for the study. The primary data collection tool in this study was argument maps generated by pre-service teachers on various pedagogical and authentic cases by using an online free tool. Assessing critical thinking and the quality of argument maps, two different types of rubrics (holistic vs analytic) that appear to have the face and construct validity were located. Experimental evidence supports statistically significant progress in pre-service teachers’ critical thinking scores after engaging in deliberate computer-assisted argument mapping practices regularly as homework assignments. There is also sufficient evidence to suggest a moderate relationship between critical thinking and argument quality. The study advances our knowledge of engaging in deliberate computer assisted practices to be an appropriate course of action for promoting critical thinking by helping pre-service teachers diagram qualified arguments. It is apparent in this study the success of the use of a computer assisted argument mapping tool for promoting CT depends on to what extend students are engaged in constructing better argument maps with each round of practice and scaffold.},

A nice initiative, which intends to set a groundwork for responsible research and innovation and actively implement crowdsourcing for language learning of all citizens regardless of their diversified social, educational, and linguistic backgrounds is enetCollect. In order to achieve these goals, a sound framework that embraces the ethical and legal considerations should be established. The framework is intended for all the current and prospective creators of crowd-oriented educational systems. It incorporates the ethical issues affecting the three stakeholders: collaborative content creators, prospective users, as well as the institutions intending to implement the approach for educational purposes. The proposed framework offers a practical solution intending to overcome the revealed barriers, which might increase the risk of compromising its main educational goals.

The methodology employs a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm with dynamic resource allocation to optimize multiple objectives simultaneously. Adaptive learning control is incorporated to balance exploration and exploitation. Theoretical analyses provide convergence proofs for the proposed algorithms. Comprehensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed mechanisms compared to state-of-the-art approaches. The results show significant performance gains regarding solution quality, scalability, and computational efficiency.

 abstract = {As a fundamental research task for intelligent education, knowledge tracing (KT) aims to trace learners’ dynamic knowledge states and predict their future performance based on their historical response data. However, learners’ cognitive processes cannot be studied in isolation from the context; nevertheless, existing knowledge tracing models mainly use knowledge topology as auxiliary information but do not deeply explore the contextual information of exercises. Thus, an in-depth exploration of multi-layer contextual information in learning scenarios is required, focusing on the cognitive differences among different learners. Furthermore, knowledge tracing models exhibit limited interpretability compared with cognition diagnosis methods integrating educational priors. To address these issues, we propose a multi-layer context-aware deep knowledge tracing (MLC-DKT) model. Specifically, we first present the multi-layer contextual representation method involving knowledge concepts and exercises. In the knowledge state tracing module, we incorporate the learners’ knowledge priors into the attention mechanism to capture the evolution of the learners’ knowledge. Then, we develop a calculation method for the similarity effect among the contextual information, which helps estimate the learners’ knowledge states. In the learning performance prediction module, we introduce the guessing and slipping factors from the cognition diagnosis model to optimize the MLC-DKT model, further improving the performance of the KT model. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets, demonstrating that the MLC-DKT model provides improved predictions of learner performance. Moreover, the MLC-DKT model realizes contextual awareness from knowledge concepts and exercises, making the predictions more interpretable.},
