 abstract = {The traditional educational systems in certain nations, such as those in the Arab world, use the previous year's scores to forecast academic achievement. Meanwhile, the science, technology, engineering, arts and mathematics (STEAM) educational system also considers the student's talents and interests, in addition to their test results, for each of the years of study used to forecast academic achievement. However, despite the numerous variables that could potentially impact a student's future profession, the STEAM educational system accurately predicts the academic achievement of students in five to seven broad majors. A smart model, data, generative, factors (DGF), has been proposed to assign a specific major for each student based on their academic background, interests, skills, and main influencing factors. The DGF model uses the supervised deep neural network and is trained by the generative adversarial network (GAN) algorithm. The DGF model has the capability to predict a specific major among 17 different majors for every student, with a high learning performance (1.4133), a plausible error rate (0.0046), a rational number of learning epochs (206), and an optimal accuracy of 99.99%.},

 abstract = {The efficiency, flexibility, and resilience of building-integrated energy systems are challenged by unpredicted changes in operational environments due to climate change and its consequences. On the other hand, the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) has equipped buildings with an ability to learn. A lot of research has been dedicated to specific machine learning applications for specific phases of a building's life-cycle. The reviews commonly take a specific, technological perspective without a vision for the integration of smart technologies at the level of the whole system. Especially, there is a lack of discussion on the roles of autonomous AI agents and training environments for boosting the learning process in complex and abruptly changing operational environments. This review article discusses the learning ability of buildings with a system-level perspective and presents an overview of autonomous machine learning applications that make independent decisions for building energy management. We conclude that the buildings’ adaptability to unpredicted changes can be enhanced at the system level through AI-initiated learning processes and by using digital twins as training environments. The greatest potential for energy efficiency improvement is achieved by integrating adaptability solutions at the timescales of HVAC control and electricity market participation.},

 abstract = {Learning Analytics aims to discover the class of students' performance over time. This helps instructors make in-time interventions but, discovering the students' performance class in virtual learning environments consider a challenge due to distance constraints. Many studies, which applied to Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) datasets, built predictive models but, these models were applied to specific courses and students and classify students into binary classes. Moreover, their results were obtained at the end of the course period thus delaying making in-time interventions. To bridge this gap, this study proposes a day-wise multi-class model to predict students’ performance using Artificial Neural Network and Long Short-Term Memory, named ANN-LSTM. To check the validity of this model, two baseline models, the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), were conducted and compared with ANN-LSTM in this context. Additionally, the results of ANN-LSTM were compared with the state-of-the-art models in terms of accuracy. The results show that the ANN-LSTM model obtained the best results among baseline models. The accuracy obtained by ANN-LSTM was about 70% at the end of the third month of the course and outperforms RNN and GRU models which obtained 53% and 57%, respectively. Also, the ANN-LSTM model obtained the best accuracy results with enhancement rates of about 6–14% when compared with state-of-the-art models. This highlights the ability of LSTM as a time series model to make early predictions for student performance in MOOC taking benefit of its architecture and ability to keep latent dependencies.},

 abstract = {The ANN is a commonly used network for pattern recognition, and has been trained for various tasks such as prediction, classification, and engineering. However, this model faces challenges such as local minima and slow convergence, which have been addressed through different strategies such as combining the artificial neural network (ANN) with optimised models like the cuckoo search (CS) algorithm. However, for large datasets, the hybrid ANN-based CS algorithm can lead to overfitting. To overcome this issue, the authors propose a new algorithm called Principal Component Analysis with Cuckoo Search Neural Network (PCACSNN). The performance of this algorithm is compared to other commonly used algorithms such as ANN, backpropagation neural network (BPNN), and cuckoo search backpropagation (CSBP), using the Mean Square Error (MSE) and accuracy on classification problems. The simulations were performed on the Student Performance dataset taken from the UCIMLR. The results show that the proposed model performs better than the other models, achieving high accuracy and low MSE for both mathematics and Portuguese student datasets. For the mathematics students, the suggested model attained an accuracy of (99.32%) with MSE of 2.77E-07 for 70% training data and an accuracy of 98.52% with MSE of 2.50E-04 for 30% training data. Similarly, for the Portuguese student dataset, the proposed model obtained (99.38%) accuracy with MSE of 1.09E-08 for 70% training data and 98.72% accuracy with MSE of 1.01E-04 for 30% training data.},

 abstract = {Finite Mixture of Regressions (FMR) are among the most widely used models for dealing with heterogeneity in regression problems. FMR is a model-based clustering approach that models the data by assigning individual observations to one of the K latent regression clusters. In some applications, it is desired to cluster groups of observations together rather than individually. We present an extension to the regular FMR, that we call the Grouped Mixture of Regressions (GMR), which allows for a known group structure among observations, in addition to their possibly unknown heterogeneity. The research is motivated by a large financial longitudinal dataset from a brand of automotive dealerships across the United States. The task was to cluster the dealers based on their financial performance and also improve performance prediction for individual dealers. We derive a fast and salable algorithm for estimating the model parameters using Expectation–Maximization (EM). We also show how the group structure can improve prediction by sharing information among members of each group, as reflected in the posterior predictive density under GMR. The performance of the approach is assessed using both synthetic data as well as the dealership data. Among our findings are the superior predictive performance of GMR and the ability to correctly detect the number of clusters using simple cross-validation.},

 abstract = {With the advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the increasing volume of online educational data, Deep Learning techniques have played a critical role in predicting student performance. Recent developments have assisted instructors in determining the strengths and weaknesses of student achievement. This understanding will benefit from adopting the necessary interventions to assist students in improving their performance, helping at-risk of failure students, and preventing dropout rates. The review analyzed 46 studies between 2019 and 2023 that apply one or more Deep Learning (DL) techniques, either single or in combination with Machine Learning (ML) or Ensemble Learning techniques. Moreover, the review utilized datasets from public Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), private Learning Management Systems (LMSs), and other platforms. Four categories were used to group the features: demographic, previous academic performance, current academic performance, and learning behavior/activity features. The analysis revealed that the DNNs and CNN-LSTM models were the most common techniques. Moreover, the studies that used DL techniques, such as CNNs, DNNs, and LSTMs, performed well by achieving high prediction accuracy above 90%; other studies achieved accuracy ranging (60 to 90)%. For datasets used within the reviewed studies, even though 44% of the studies used LMSs datasets, Open University Learning Analytics Dataset (OULAD) was the most used dataset from MOOCs. The analysis of grouped features shows that among the various categories examined, learning behavior and activity features stand out as the most significant predictors, suggesting that students engagement with their learning environment through their overall participation offers crucial insights into their success. The educational prediction findings hopefully serve as a strong foundation for administrators and instructors to observe student performance and provide a suitable educational adaptation that can meet their needs to protect them from failure and prevent their dropout.},

The integration of both unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques has demonstrated significant efficacy in predicting student performance. This paper explores the application of different machine learning methods in predicting student academic performance. Initially, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was utilised to reduce the dataset’s dimensionality, thereby improving its visualisation. Subsequently, K-Means clustering was employed to segregate students into distinct groups, reflective of their learning behaviors. Afterwards, the observed clusters were utilised for training classification models to address each student cluster individually. This approach was implemented in a case study involving an undergraduate science course at a North American University (NAU) and the Open University Learning Analytics Dataset (OULAD). Empirical findings indicate that the combined use of Feedforward Dense Network (FDN), Random Forest (RF), and Decision Tree (DT), specifically in their clustered forms, outperforms other classifiers in predicting student academic performance effectively.},

 abstract = {Summary
Industrial data analytics methods play a central role in improving energy storage performance and efficiency, impacting the future of electrified transportation and renewable electricity generation. However, significant challenges hinder the large-scale deployment of batteries. Conventional methods rely on centralized collection and processing of fleet-level data, leading to database size issues and privacy concerns due to potential data breaches. To enable scalable deployment of battery management systems, this article proposes a federated battery diagnosis and prognosis model, which distributes the processing of battery standard current-voltage-time-usage data in a privacy-preserving manner. Instead of transferring the raw data, this approach communicates only the locally processed parameters, thus reducing communication load and preserving data confidentiality. The federated model offers a paradigm shift in battery health management through privacy-preserving distributed methods for battery data processing and lifetime prediction, ensuring the reliable and sustainable deployment of lithium-ion batteries in a rapidly evolving world.},

 abstract = {Educators' loss of ability to read students' comprehension level during the class through quick questions or nonverbal communication is one of the main challenges of online and blended learning. Many researchers recently tackled this problem by proposing different frameworks for predicting students' academic performance. However, previous work relies heavily on feature engineering. Feature engineering is the process of selecting, transforming, manipulating, and constructing new variables from raw data using domain knowledge. A disadvantage of feature engineering is that the features are tailored to a specific dataset making the constructed models inflexible when used in new datasets. A direct consequence is that features need to be rebuilt for each course. This paper proposes a more flexible framework to predict the students' academic performance. In this framework, the raw data is used directly to construct the prediction model without the feature engineering step. The feature selection is instead based on model interpretability. The framework is applied to the open university learning analytics dataset (OULAD) with two different type of classifiers: random forest and artificial neural networks. Obtained results show that the feature engineering step can be abandoned without affecting the models' prediction performance. The prediction results of the flexible feature selection framework either outperform or have a difference of less than 1% accuracy compared to other work in the literature that relies on a manual feature engineering step. Both random forest and artificial neural networks without feature engineering accomplish a high prediction accuracy for the case of students at risk of failing with 86% and 88% compared to all students with pass grades and students with distinction grades, respectively. Also, the prediction models have the highest accuracy rate of 93% in predicting drop-out students. Yet, the prediction models in the proposed framework and previous research work perform poorly in predicting high achieving students with maximum accuracy of 81%, a precision of 69%, and a recall of 57%.},

Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was used to explore assessment factors and formulate the model. Then, the constructed model was verified by confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). AMADEUS consists of 12 factors in 4 components: responsibility, interest in course material, class participation, and honesty. The experimental results indicated that AMADEUS was consistent with the empirical data and passed all criteria for consideration. After that, an assessment and reporting tool called MOZART has been developed. MOZART employed the AMADEUS model to assess students’ affective domain from log files using Hadoop and ELK stack technologies.

 abstract = {Well log data imputation is crucial for subsurface geology interpretation, which helps identify the most productive areas for drilling, minimize exploration risks, and maximize hydrocarbon recovery. Obtaining high-quality well data can be challenging due to various issues such as drilling problems, improper logging processes, or operational issues with logging tools. Accurate and reliable imputation methods are essential to address missing or incomplete information in well log data, allowing better decision-making in the oil and gas industry. This study presents a novel well log data imputation method for the West Natuna Basin in Indonesia, using time-series deep learning models. Focusing on the “Kappa” well dataset with missing Vp log data, we trained long short-term memory (LSTM), gated recurrent unit (GRU), and bidirectional LSTM (Bi-LSTM) models using a window-based time step sequence of 10-timesteps intervals as input. The LSTM was observed as the best model, achieving a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of about 2.2% and an R-squared (R2) of about 94%. This result suggests that deep sequence model can be effectively used for missing data imputation in well log. Lastly, a petrophysical analysis further underlines the importance of these findings, offering deeper insights into reservoir properties, and value of our research in real-world exploration scenarios. The findings can aid in improving the accuracy and reliability of imputation in well log data, enabling better decision-making in the oil and gas industry.},

In many countries worldwide, high-stakes exams happening at the end of the school year determine college admissions. This paper investigates the impact of using historical data of school and high-stakes exams results to train a model to predict high-stakes exams given the available data in the Spring. The most transparent and accurate model turns out to be a linear regression model with high school GPA as the main predictor. Further analysis of the predictions reflect how high-stakes exams relate to GPA in high school for different subgroups in the population. Predicted scores slightly advantage females and low SES individuals, who perform relatively worse in high-stakes exams than in high school. Our preferred model accounts for about 50% of the out-of-sample variation in the high-stakes exam. On average, the student rank using predicted scores differs from the actual rank by almost 17 percentiles. This suggests that either high-stakes exams capture individual skills that are not measured by high school grades or that high-stakes exams are a noisy measure of the same skill.},

 abstract = {Academic failure is a persistent challenge in education. Despite the limited available data, in this study, we focus on identifying at-risk students in a blended learning (BL) course. Several motivational variables are analyzed to determine their effect on student performance. We use a machine-learning classifier to compare two approaches: 1) The benchmark study, which uses data from the same academic year for both training and testing; and 2) a prospective study, which focuses on extrapolating a model trained on the previous fall semester to predict outcomes for the upcoming fall semester. We categorize the motivational variables, including time management and event-occurrence frequency. The window-expansion strategy is adopted to enhance performance through periodic evaluation to facilitate timely intervention. Consequently, the prospective approach is consistent with the benchmark results, thus demonstrating its generalizability across academic years and student populations. This approach is promising for identifying at-risk students in the BL course early. The Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) method emphasizes the importance of time-management variables, particularly study in time, for identifying at-risk students. This study enhances our understanding of early detection methods for at-risk students. By analyzing time-related behaviors, we establish a robust foundation for data-driven decisions to improve future BL implementations as well as support motivation and self-regulated learning practices.},

 abstract = {Institutions of higher learning are currently facing the challenging task of attracting new students who can effectively meet their diverse academic demands. With these demands come the need for those institutions to develop strategies that can enhance students' learning experiences at various educational levels. Predicting the academic success at an early stage would allow academic institutions to develop specific enrolment guidelines while avoiding poor performance. The main purpose of this study was to predict the academic performance of students, their cumulative grade point average (CGPA) in particular, at postgraduate levels (e.g., master’s degree), using and comparing different machine learning (ML) algorithms. This work uses a real dataset of 635 master’s students collected from the college of graduate studies of a reputable private university in Malaysia. The predictive model’s goodness-of-fitness is determined using the coefficient of determination R2, which indicates the percentage of the variance in the dependent variables. The mean square error (MSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) are used to evaluate the model’s performance, by identifying discrepancies between the predicted CGPA and the actual CGPA. Of the six different ML models applied, our results showed that the artificial neural network (ANN) model has the best performance, achieving 89% of the variation in the CGPA of the students, with a training error of only 0.06 CGPA points and a prediction error of 0.08 CGPA points. The Gaussian process regression (GPR) model with squared exponential kernel algorithm achieved 71% of the CGPA variation. The model achieved 0.095 CGPA points for both training and evaluation errors. Exploring other variables such as research activities, marital status, and living conditions would have improved the overall accuracy of the proposed ML models. Therefore, future investigations should focus on predicting the academic performance of larger numbers of postgraduates (i.e., PhD and Masters) using different predictive variables and AI models.},

The term educational big data stems from the rapidly growing educational data development, including students' inherent attributes, learning behavior, and psychological state. Educational big data has many applications that can be used for educational administration, teaching innovation, and research management. The representative examples of such applications are student academic performance prediction, employment recommendation, and financial support for low-income students. Different empirical studies have shown that it is possible to predict student performance in the courses during the next term. Predictive research for the higher education stage has become an attractive area of study since it allowed us to predict student behavior. In this survey, we will review predictive research, its applications, and its challenges. We first introduce the significance and background of educational big data. Second, we review the students' academic performance prediction research, such as factors influencing students' academic performance, predicting models, evaluating indices. Third, we introduce the applications of educational big data such as prediction, recommendation, and evaluation. Finally, we investigate challenging research issues in this area.

 abstract = {Machine learning (ML) is a new-age thriving technology, which facilitates computers to read and interpret from the previously present data automatically. It makes use of multiple algorithms to build models, mathematical in nature, and then makes predictions for the new data using the past data and knowledge. Lately, it has been adopted for text detection, hate speech detection, recommender system, face detection, and more. In this paper, majorly all the aspects concerning five machine learning algorithms namely-K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Genetic Algorithm (GA), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT) , and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network have been discussed in great detail which is a prerequisite for venturing into the field of ML. This paper throws light on various new results and conclusions related to these algorithms via research and review of recently published papers that carried out quantitative and qualitative research on real-time problems, mainly predictive analytics in multidisciplinary fields. This paper also talks about the circumstantial origin of these algorithms, which although has been rarely talked about in previous publications, is a preeminent point of discussion for ML enthusiasts and amateurs, both. To explain and understand the accuracy, robustness, and reliability of the algorithms, they were exhaustively reviewed and researched in all aspects qualitatively and quantitatively, wherein the LSTM network and SVM algorithm have projected a superior behavior over the rest. The paper answers all relevant questions that may arise during the study of these algorithms ranging from their origin, to their definition, methodologies of execution, real-time applications attached with sufficient novel evidence, followed by the advantages and major trade-offs; lastly an elaborate comparison of their performances on quantitative and qualitative grounds has been presented. To conclude, the paper also highlights the future scope of ML algorithms and artificial intelligence in the coming times and their roles in automation and holistic development, not just in technology-related aspects but also, the humanitarian aspects, finally followed by reliable and relevant conclusions derived from this exhaustive research.},

Although prior studies have generated single point estimates to quantify predictive efficacy, much less education research has examined variability in student performance predictions using nonparametric bootstrap algorithms in data pipelines. In this study, bootstrapping was applied to examine performance variability among five data mining methods (DMMs) and four filter preprocessing feature selection techniques for forecasting course grades for 3225 students enrolled in an undergraduate biology class. While the median area under the curve (AUC) values obtained from bootstrapping were significantly lower than the AUC point estimates obtained without resampling, DMMs and feature selection techniques impacted variability in different ways. The ensemble technique elastic net regression (GLMNET) significantly outperformed all other DMMs and exhibited the least amount of variability in the AUC. However, all filter feature selection techniques significantly increased variability in student success predictions, compared to when this step was omitted from the data pipeline. We discuss the potential benefits and drawbacks of incorporating bootstrapping into prediction pipelines to track, monitor, and forecast classroom performance, as well as highlight the risks of only examining point estimates.},

 abstract = {This paper identifies the most significant learning factors impacting undergraduate academic performance using artificial neural networks (ANNs) and controlled student data collection. As higher education becomes increasingly common and important, finding the best ways to help students optimize their studies is vital. Questionnaires gathered data on student behaviours and achievement from five classes within a semester, constraining variability to compare learning activities directly. The questionnaire captured engagement, psychological factors, effort, course load, time management, and performance data. Statistical and exploratory analysis investigated the dataset. A multilayer perceptron model was developed, using backpropagation and cross-validation to optimize predictive accuracy. The model identified class attendance, sleep quality, and questioning during lectures as most correlated with high grades. Additional patterns emerged around research participation, motivation, cramming, and theoretical studying. This research demonstrates new techniques for associating detailed study behaviours with academic achievement through strictly controlled student data collection and the application of artificial neural networks for predictive modelling. The constrained variability in the dataset allows for isolating the impact from specific learning activities. The controlled student data and machine learning-driven predictive modelling provide information on the optimal grouping of student effort across engagement, health, and studying factors.},

 abstract = {Statement of problem
The students’ academic performance is influenced by a complex interplay among several factors. Traditional educational approaches often struggle to accommodate the diverse needs of students, leading to suboptimal learning outcomes.
Purpose
This article aims to comprehensively understand the role of study strategies and learning disabilities in shaping academic performance. Through the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) tools, the purpose is to propose a decision support system (DSS) for recommendations to improve the educational approach.
Method
To identify features with higher explanatory power based on empirical data, we employed an artificial neural network (ANN) to recognize patterns of association between study strategies, learning disabilities, and academic performance. Using the pondered features, a Fuzzy-based AI was built for offering recommendations into effective educational interventions.
Conclusions
The findings underscore the significance of study strategies in mitigating the negative impact of learning disabilities on academic performance. By leveraging the proposed AI tools framework, educators can make informed decisions to tailor educational approaches, catering to the unique cognitive profiles of students. Personalized interventions based on identified patterns can lead to improved academic outcomes and greater inclusivity in the learning environment.
Practical implications
Educators and policymakers can adopt the proposed data-driven strategies to enhance teaching methodologies, thereby accommodating the varying needs of students with learning disabilities. This approach fosters a more inclusive and equitable educational landscape, promoting academic success for all learners.},

It motivates more research works to alleviate the black box nature of deep structures with performance maintained. This paper proposes a fuzzy-embedded recurrent neural network (FE-RNN) to improve interpretability of the underlying neural networks. It is a parallel deep structure comprising an RNN and a Pseudo Outer-Product based Fuzzy Neural Network (POPFNN) that share a common set of input and output linguistic concepts. The inference processes undertaken are associated by RNN using fuzzy rules in the embedded POPFNN. Fuzzy IF-THEN rules provide better interpretability of the inference process of the hybrid networks. It allows an effective realisation of a data driven implication using RNN in the modelling of fuzzy entailment within a fuzzy neural networks (FNN) structure. FE-RNN obtains more consistent results than other FNN in the experiment using the Mackey-Glass dataset. FE-RNN achieves about 99% correlation for forecasting prices of market indexes. Its interpretability is also discussed. FE-RNN then acts as a prediction tool in a financial trading system using forecast-assisted technical indicators optimised with Genetic Algorithms.

 abstract = {Cognitive diagnosis is an intelligent education task that aims to learn students’ cognitive states on knowledge concepts based on historical answering logs over questions. Existing studies focus on modeling the interactions between students and questions through either manual-designed functions (e.g., logistic function) or complex neural network structures. However, such studies neglect the question difficulty bias, i.e., questions exhibit uneven distribution on the answering frequency, as simple questions are answered more times than difficult ones for the given concept. To tackle this issue, we present a Causal Cognitive Diagnosis Framework (CausalCDF), which considers the question difficulty bias and could be readily integrated with traditional diagnostic models for better cognitive diagnosis. Specifically, we first analyze the effect of question difficulty (acting as the confounder) on student performance via a causal graph. Then we eliminate the bad effect of the confounding difficulty bias via causal intervention in model training. We instantiate CausalCDF on five representative diagnostic models and perform extensive experiments on two real-world datasets. Empirical studies prove the effectiveness of CausalCDF compared to existing studies.},

 abstract = {The proactive prediction and systematic classification of students' academic performance empower educational administrators with the invaluable capability to not only pinpoint potential challenges but also to craft targeted strategies and interventions that are tailored to the unique needs of students. This multifaceted approach enables educational institutions to proactively address issues within the education system, fostering a more equitable and effective learning environment for all, while simultaneously fostering a culture of continuous improvement and accountability in the pursuit of educational excellence. Hence, the current investigation aims to classify and predict the students' performance by examining and comparing the machine learning and artificial neural network assessments. Five methods of the Random Forest Classifier, the Decision Tree Classifier, the K Neighbors Classifier, the MLP Classifier, and the XG-Boost Classifier are used. These methods' performances are compared through the accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score indicators. This comparison is applied to the base data and balanced data, which is carried out by the SVM-SMOTE technique. Finally, five metaheuristic algorithms are applied to the selected method to evaluate the performance indicators of the hybrid models. The results indicate that applying the SVM-SMOTE technique improves the methods' performance, in which the XG-Boost represented the best performance. As a result, the metaheuristic algorithms are applied to the XG-Boost, yielding to 9.33%, 8.44%, 9.33%, and 9.27% enhancement of the Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1-Score values. Subsequently, the Enhanced Artificial Ecosystem-Based Optimization + XG-Boost hybrid method provides the accuracy and F1-score values of 0.9417 and 0.9413. These results underscore the potential of combining machine learning techniques with metaheuristic algorithms to enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of predicting and classifying students' performance, thus providing valuable insights for educational administrators to address issues and improve the education system.},

 abstract = {A significant goal of modern universities is to provide high-quality education to their students and reduce their failure rates. The early recognition of low-performance students that would potentially lead them to increase their duration of studies with a high probability of failing their courses would allow the university to enhance their performance by taking measures. This article proposes a grammatical evolution-based feature selection and construction method for radial basis function (RBF) networks that predict students’ future grades and study duration based on past courses’ data. The proposed method was compared with Levenberg–Marquardt back-propagation (LM-BP), Broyden, Fletcher, Goldfarb, and Shanno back-propagation (BFGS-BP), stochastic gradient descent (SGD), RBF-based neural network (RBFNN), decision tree (DT), Bayesian network (BN), support vector machine (SVM), and neural network construction (NNC) existing machine learning methods in twelve regression datasets (six for predicting future grades and six for predicting study duration). The datasets contained entries from the physics, philosophy, primary education history, mathematics, and chemistry departments at the University of Ioannina. The experiments showed that it managed to get the lowest mean square error in nine out of twelve regression problems. The experimental study also compared the proposed method with the LM-BP, BFGS-BP, SGD, RBFNN, SVM, and NNC methods in twelve classification datasets (six for predicting future grades and six for predicting study duration) from the same departments. The experimental results on all classification problems showed that the proposed method got the highest accuracy in all datasets. The proposed method can be expanded with other faculties’ and universities’ data forming a complete application usable by universities worldwide.},

 abstract = {In recent years, Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) has become emerging innovation in robotics research and development. Research in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) aims to understand, design, and evaluate robotic systems intended for human use. Robots and humans must communicate for interaction to occur. Human-robot communication can take various forms, but the proximity of the two parties heavily influences these forms.HRI innovations entail learning, designing, and evaluating robotics systems that communicate with people. Robots connecting and speaking with humans are becoming increasingly common at home, customer service, education, and healthcare. Despite the fact that there are now many robotic instruments that teach students how to learn various subjects and activities, efficient integration of the prediction model is still under development. Therefore, this research introduces a student engagement prediction model using HRI (SEPM-HRI) in higher education. This model uses the supervised learning algorithm for student engagement prediction. The experimental results show that the proposed model can implement in a real-time scenario with the expected prediction accuracy of 98.78%. The experimental results show that the proposed SEPM-HRImodel enhances an accuracy ratio of 98.78%, interaction ratio of 95.62%, prediction ratio of 96.35%, a learning rate of 94.26%, a student engagement ratio of 93.14%, and a student participation ratio of 92.86%. This model gives the mean square error rate of 30.21% compared to other existing approaches.},

 abstract = {Knowledge tracing (KT) aims to monitor students’ evolving knowledge states through their learning interactions with concept-related questions, and can be indirectly evaluated by predicting how students will perform on future questions. In this paper, we observe that there is a common phenomenon of answer bias, i.e., a highly unbalanced distribution of correct and incorrect answers for each question. Existing models tend to memorize the answer bias as a shortcut for achieving high prediction performance in KT, thereby failing to fully understand students’ knowledge states. To address this issue, we approach the KT task from a causality perspective. A causal graph of KT is first established, from which we identify that the impact of answer bias lies in the direct causal effect of questions on students’ responses. A novel COunterfactual REasoning (CORE) framework for KT is further proposed, which separately captures the total causal effect and direct causal effect during training, and mitigates answer bias by subtracting the latter from the former in testing. The CORE framework is applicable to various existing KT models, and we implement it based on the prevailing DKT, DKVMN, and AKT models, respectively. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of CORE in making the debiased inference for KT. We have released our code at https://github.com/lucky7-code/CORE.},

 abstract = {Data mining techniques are intensively used to uncover relevant patterns in large volumes of complex data which are continuously extended with newly arrived data instances. Relational association rules (RARs), a data analysis and mining concept, have been introduced as an extension of classical association rules (ARs) for capturing various relationships between the attributes characterizing the data. Due to its NP-completeness, the problem of mining all the interesting RARs within a data set is computationally difficult. As the dimensionality of the data set to be mined increases, the classical algorithm Discovery of Relational Association Rules (DRAR) for RARs mining fails in providing the set of rules in reasonable time. This paper introduces a new approach named CRAR (Concurrent Relational Association Rule mining) which uses concurrency for the RARs discovery process and thus significantly reduces the mining time. The effectiveness of CRAR is empirically validated on nine open source data sets. The reduction in mining time when using CRAR against DRAR emphasizes that it can be successfully applied in various practical data mining scenarios.},

For a better understanding of the educational related phenomena, there is a continuous interest in applying supervised and unsupervised learning methods for obtaining additional insights into the students’ learning process. The problem of predicting if a student will pass or fail at a certain academic discipline based on the students’ grades received during the semester is a difficult one, highly dependent on various conditions such as the course, the number of examinations during the semester, the instructors and their exigences. We propose a new classification model, S PRAR (Students Performance prediction using Relational Association Rules) for predicting the final result of a student at a certain academic discipline using relational association rules (RARs). RARs extend the classical association rules for expressing various relationships between data attributes. Experiments are performed on three real academic data sets collected from Babeş-Bolyai University from Romania. The performance of the S PRAR classifier on the considered case studies is compared against existing related work, being superior to previously proposed students’ performance predictors.},

 abstract = {The paper approaches the topic of nowcasting, one of the hottest topics in meteorology which deals with the problem of short-term forecasting of severe weather phenomena. Various types of meteorological data, including radar measurements, satellite data and weather stations’ observations are currently used for forecasting severe weather events. Radar data is one of the important sources used by meteorologists for nowcasting and for providing alerts for severe weather events. We are proposing a new one-class classifier, named RadRAR (Radar products’ values prediction using Relational Association Rules) for convective storms nowcasting based on radar data. More specifically, RadRAR is trained on radar data collected from normal weather conditions and learns to predict whether the radar echo values will be higher than 35dBZ, i.e. likely to indicate the occurrence of a storm. RadRAR is intended to be a proof a concept that relational association rule mining applied on radar data is helpful in discriminating between severe and normal weather conditions. Real radar data provided by the Romanian National Meteorological Administration is used for evaluating the effectiveness of RadRAR. A Critical Success Index of 61% was obtained, outperforming similar approaches from the literature and highlighting a good performance of RadRAR.},

 abstract = {Across intelligent education, knowledge tracing (KT) is a fundamental problem in realizing personalized education. Recently, several approaches using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) view knowledge tracing problems as predicting a student’s future performance based on the student’s past learning activities. However, deep learning-based models merely predict the students’ future performance, failing to explain the reason why the students answered correctly or incorrectly. These approaches are seldom investigated from a theoretical perspective, preventing a deep understanding of student learning. In this paper, we first define incremental knowledge tracing problem and then propose a dynamic tracing method to track students’ knowledge changes, a new online learning-based model, named Online Meta-knowledge Dictionary Learning (OMDL). OMDL assumes that student knowledge increment is processed with stationary independent increments and derives the objective function of knowledge tracing from the perspective of probability. More precisely, this method has three innovations: propose an online learning algorithm suitable for hidden Markov data; update the meta-knowledge dictionary and students’ knowledge representation online without collecting all data; and trace student knowledge increment explicitly. The empirical study was conducted on four education public datasets, with student prediction accuracy used as the metric for assessing algorithm effectiveness. Experimental results indicate that the OMDL algorithm outperforms existing knowledge tracing methods, achieving a 20% increase in prediction accuracy across all datasets.},

 abstract = {The current research descends into the discrete connection between self-esteem, individuality and academic achievement among primary school learners. It addresses the essential need for predictive algorithms to analyze and forecast academic results. Self-esteem and identity, as diverse psychological variables, have been highlighted as crucial determinants in creating academic success. The fundamental goal is to develop an effective prediction model for elementary school children's academic performance by including self-esteem and individuality in the analytical framework. We suggested an Owl Search Optimized Dynamic Deep Neural Network (OSO-DDNN) based model for making more precise predictions. The sample size for the research was 147,210 elementary school students who took the LegiLexi exam between 2016 and 2021. To standardize the data and improve model performance, the suggested methodology uses a pre-processing strategy based on the Min-Max scalar approach. Furthermore, Independent Component Analysis is used to detect and extract essential factors related to self-esteem, individuality and academic achievement. The architecture and parameters of the suggested approaches are optimized using the OSO algorithm to provide a prediction model that remains accurate and efficient. We quantify the effectiveness of the assessments using the following metrics: precision, recall, accuracy and F1-score to develop a design using conventional methods. The findings demonstrate that the model's resilience and promise for anticipating primary school pupils' academic success are based on psychological aspects. The OSO-DDNN is an essential instrument for educators and policymakers in identifying at-risk pupils and implementing targeted interventions, supporting a comprehensive approach to education that combines psychological well-being with academic performance.},

 abstract = {A cognitive state (CS) assessment can be effectively performed using Electroencephalogram (EEG). However, due to the curse of dimensionality issues of EEG, most of the clustering methods often lead to poor performance. Deep neural network-based representation learning transforms high-dimensional data into lower-dimensional feature space, increasing the performance of CS prediction in students. So, in this research, a novel graph-based conventional attention neural network (GA-CNN) is developed to reduce distribution differences while analyzing student performance. To perform this classification, the obtained EEG signal dataset is denoised with the help of Stationary Wavelet Transform (SWT) based Independent Component Analysis (ICA) that filters out the noise signals. Likewise, the behavioural dataset is pre-processed using zero normalization and Not a Number (NaN) value computation method. Then, the effective features are extracted from the pre-processed data using the Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) technique. Finally, the GA-CNN model is initiated to classify the students’ cognitive state (CS). The proposed method is implemented using the MATLAB tool, and the performance of the expected GA-CNN model is compared to other approaches where the analysis is done using the benchmark Kaggle EEG data set. The classification accuracy is significantly improved compared to other methods. The model achieves 87% accuracy, 98% precision, 75% recall, and 85% F1 score, outperforming various methods and making a better compromise.},

Subsequently, the teaching quality evaluation system was constructed using hierarchical analysis. Finally, the effectiveness of the teaching model was tested. The results showed that under this teaching model, students’ overall literacy score reached a maximum of 11.5, and their average score in music and dance reached a maximum of 94, an increase of 11 points compared to the SPOC teaching mode. This indicates that the teaching mode gives full play to the advantages of SPOC teaching, enhances students’ enthusiasm and initiative in learning, and improves their professionalism and comprehensive quality.},

This research proposes using Moodle's learning logs to classify learning patterns and outliers in order to identify struggling learners. The proposed method uses the descriptive statistics between the learner's teaching material clickstream and the final test score accumulated in Moodle, and students can be classified into four learning patterns. The frequency of each learning pattern was correlated with the appearance of outliers in the final test score and the teaching material clickstream. Most learners moved through four learning patterns during the weekly lessons, however, some learners scoring at the top and bottom of the weekly quiz scores repeated the same learning patterns. There was a tendency to correspond to an outlier due to the repetition of the same learning pattern. The time-series learning analytics of the teaching material clickstream revealed that learners with low final test scores and abnormal values tended to fall under a learning pattern with a smaller teaching material clickstream and a smaller access outside class hours.},

 abstract = {The way schools address migratory movements has a direct impact on integration and social cohesion, making the in-depth study of factors that affect the lower performance of immigrant students in comparison with non-immigrants essential. Using a methodology based on random coefficient models, this paper analyses the differential effect of individual level and school level variables on the estimation of mathematical competence in non-immigrant and immigrant populations. Data are extracted from an educational assessment programme carried out in the Basque Autonomous Community. The sample consists of 16,981 students with an average age of 13.7 years, of which 1,369 are immigrant students. The results reveal that individual and family-level variables show significantly higher impact on student performance than school-level variables. The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of investing in policies to support diversity that work at family level, as a means to achieve fuller equit.},

Recent advances reveal that digital environments will support the development of learning and assessment activities in ways that will both increase the inferential fidelity of assessments and change the form of assessments altogether. Digital technologies can also automate data collection and the production of assessment inferences on a massive scale. Here, we discuss the wide variation in digital learning experiences and explain how they are transforming traditional language for discussing assessment. We argue that the predigital constraints on assessment have skewed our thinking about assessment and give examples of new and novel approaches. Second, we discuss how digital environments can allow us to capture and make inferences from simple or complex learning activities in new ways. Third, we point to advances in machine learning and AI that have the potential to change current and future assessment practices. Finally, we argue for balancing enthusiasm for digital environments against the challenges of making appropriate assessment inferences.},

 abstract = {Computer-advanced technologies have a significant impact across various fields. It is widely recognized that diseases have a detrimental effect on crop productivity and can significantly impact the economy, particularly in agricultural countries. Tomatoes hold great economic importance among cash crops, second only to potatoes. Globally, tomato production reaches a staggering 160 million tons annually, making it even more crucial for agricultural development. Unfortunately, the tomato crop is susceptible to several diseases, with early blight and late blight as two prominent culprits responsible for a production decrease of around 79%. Traditional disease detection and identification methods are time-consuming, expensive, and destructive, often requiring pathologists’ expertise. Thus, the primary research objective is to enhance disease identification accuracy by leveraging deep learning techniques. A model based on the inception-V3 architecture has been devised to classify diseases affecting tomato plant leaves. The model was trained and tested using the PlantVillage dataset, which comprises 6000 sample images of tomato leaves. The training and testing process utilized an 80 : 20 ratio, resulting in an impressive classification accuracy of 97.44% for the proposed model. The proposed solution aims to enable the tomato industry to thrive in the global market by mitigating the impact of tomato leaf diseases. By reducing the prevalence of these diseases, the solution can increase demand and contribute to the industry’s growth.},

A learner’s performance can be defined as how well students are learning in terms of knowledge and skills development and can be analyzed based on students’ outcomes and engagement in the course. We have consolidated the work carried out from 2011 to 2022 to improve learners’ performance using LA, describe criteria that define learners’ performance, discuss parameters that impact learners’ performance, and how predictive models can be created to forecast learners’ performance using these parameters. Results showed that the data collected from log files of the Learning Management System (LMS) had been used to get insights into the learner’s performance in online platforms and LA could bring incredible benefits in the field of the education sector, such as improvement of learners’ involvement with learning activities as well as learning outcomes, identification of students at risk, providing real-time feedback, and personalization of learning. Hence, we can say usage of LA significantly helps learners’ performance improvement in learning portals. But we can get better results if we augment data from log files of LMS with the learner’s personal data from his birth to the current moment, which is a bit challenging with respect to data collection i.e., huge and from multiple sources.},

 abstract = {Integrating engineering design into K-12 curricula is increasingly important as engineering has been incorporated into many STEM education standards. However, the ill-structured and open-ended nature of engineering design makes it difficult for an instructor to keep track of the design processes of all students simultaneously and provide personalized feedback on a timely basis. This study proposes a Bayesian network model to dynamically and automatically assess students’ engagement with engineering design tasks and to support formative feedback. Specifically, we applied a Bayesian network to 111 ninth-grade students’ process data logged by a computer-aided design software program that students used to solve an engineering design challenge. Evidence was extracted from the log files and fed into the Bayesian network to perform inferential reasoning and provide a barometer of their performance in the form of posterior probabilities. Results showed that the Bayesian network model was competent at predicting a student’s task performance. It performed well in both identifying students of a particular group (recall) and ensuring identified students were correctly labeled (precision). This study also suggests that Bayesian networks can be used to pinpoint a student’s strengths and weaknesses for applying relevant science knowledge to engineering design tasks. Future work of implementing this tool within the computer-aided design software will provide instructors a powerful tool to facilitate engineering design through automatically generating personalized feedback to students in real time.},

Previous studies have typically focused on small, closed learning communities from an individual, static, and aggregated perspective. This research aims to advance our understanding of open and large online learning networks by exploring and characterizing community level dynamics and communities of performance. To achieve this goal, we mined a large open online learning network of over 30,000 students and approximately one million posts. First, we analyzed overall community network development by building temporal social networks. Subsequently, we studied sub-community dynamics using community detection algorithms, and, following that, investigated the interaction between community dynamics and communities of performance using best colleague correlation and Kruskal-Wallis test. Results found that large open online learning communities begin with a very large network having numerous small sub-communities. These communities consist of students who are similar in performance with strong links. The overall network size gradually shrinks, as does the number of sub-communities, and these communities evolve over time for their membership formulation with students who are more different in performance with weaker ties. Theoretical, practical, and methodological implications are then discussed. This study pushed the online learning community research to examine large and open networks by taking a more community-based and dynamic view of investigation.},

The experiment compared RNN-FitNets with a normal RNN model on a dataset of 296 university students in total. The results showed that RNN-FitNets can improve early prediction. Moreover, the SHAP value was employed to explain the contribution of the input features to the prediction results by RNN-FitNets. It was shown that RNN-FitNets can consider the future effects of the input features from the early stages of the course.},

We map learner behavior to the ICAP (interactive, constructive, active, passive) framework, helping instructors to better understand the learning process of learners. The results show that SLBAS exhibits high accuracy. Moreover, Cohen’s kappa coefficient between expert coding and SLBAS is high enough to support replacing expert coding in the observation method with SLBAS to recognize the learning process of learners during STEM activities. Finally, statistical analysis establishes a correlation between the learning process and learning effectiveness. The results of this study are in line with most previous studies, demonstrating that STEM education differs from traditional teacher-centered courses in that it helps learners to improve the process of knowledge construction with practice and hands-on opportunities rather than simply receiving knowledge passively.},

 abstract = {The age of information and communication technology (ICT) has witnessed the prevalence of computer-based reading. Previous studies yielded mixed results concerning the relationship between ICT perceived competence, ICT use and digital reading performance, and the underlying mechanism was rarely explored. This study aimed to explore the relationship between ICT perceived competence and adolescents’ digital reading performance and the potential mediating roles of three types of ICT use. Multilevel mediation analyses were conducted for 199,646 15-year-old students from 29 OECD countries/regions in the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2018, in which digital reading performance was assessed by multistage adaptive computer-based testing. The results revealed that a) ICT perceived competence and digital reading performance were positively correlated; b) ICT use significantly mediated the relationship; c) students with higher-level ICT perceived competence tended to use ICT for leisure at home more frequently, which led to better digital reading performance; d) the suppression effects were revealed, indicating the need to consider the interrelationship between ICT perceived competence and ICT use. These findings provided new evidence for the self-determination theory and the ICT engagement model, suggesting that appropriate ICT use driven by high-level ICT perceived competence might help improve adolescents’ digital reading performanc.},

 abstract = {Computer simulation of energy resources has led to significant achievements in the interdisciplinary fields of energy and environment. Apart from renewable resources, fossil-fuel power generation plants can be made cleaner to satisfy the future climate targets while keeping secure and stable grid. Clean coal power plants are still among the dominant options for power generation, which are committed through energy-efficient operation, carbon capture and storage, or combination of both strategies. On the other hand, machine learning and deep learning techniques have a leading integrity in the field of simulation. This paper presents accurate models of a cleaner coal-fired supercritical (SC) unit using two types of artificial neural network, which are Elman neural network (ENN) and generalized regression neural network (GRNN). The models newly embed higher coverage range and more accurate results than previously published models. Each subsystem of the models has been structured as a multi-input single-output (MISO) component to predict the behavior of significant variables in the plant, mainly the supercritical pressure in MPa, the steam temperature in °C and the production in MW. Those variables have been intentionally selected as they are clear indicators for the energy-efficient and cleaner production. Simulation results of four sets of data have indicated satisfactory performance of both models with a bit higher superiority of the GRNN that has given negligible or zero Mean Squared Error (MSE) for all outputs, whereas the minimum MSE of the deep ENN is 3.131  ×  10−3.},

 abstract = {The effectiveness of using a constructed response measure for assessing drafting ability is proven and has been used extensively in managerial selection in state-owned organizations. With the advent of online recruitment trends and technology-enhanced assessments, automated scoring has been conceived as a replacement for human scoring with the purpose of emulating the human scoring system. In the context of large-scale writing assessments, automated scoring could provide superior results to human scoring in terms of validity and reliability. In the present study, an attempt has been made to validate an automated essay scoring (AES) algorithm. The study was conducted on a sample of 11,497 randomly selected from a population of 54,392 shortlisted candidates for a national-level examination for the selection of entry-level executives in managerial positions in state-owned banks and a state-owned insurance company. The evaluation of the descriptive (constructed response) component of the examination (English composition) was carried out parallelly by four expert human raters and the AES algorithm. The parameters for evaluation were devised and made available to raters and the algorithm. Data were analysed using mean SD and Pearson correlation coefficient. Results show that the mean scores of human expert raters (M = 14.648) and automated algorithm method (M = 15.804) were similar. Further analysis was also undertaken to check the convergent validity of the features used in the algorithm by examining the relation of algorithm scores with sub scores from the objective test of the same construct. Results indicate a significant correlation. It can thus be said that the algorithm scoring method developed can be considered a replacement in that it can complement human expert raters in the evaluation of descriptive papers with consistent scoring and fairness, without inherent biases of inter-rater and intra-rater variation, in addition to practical benefits of speed and cost.},

Findings reveal that participants perceive gamification in service settings as a useful tool. The global SA reveals a positive sentiment about the gamification approach that contributes to increasing participants’ engagement. This study’s novelty arises from quasi-experimental research to measure gamification activities’ impact on students’ engagement, measured through SA of their opinions.},

Examining the opinions of teachers from various countries on in-class assessments can significantly enhance education systems. Similarities and differences in Uganda’s and Turkey’s educational systems justify comparing them. This study aimed to examine and compare the assessment methods used by teachers working in high schools in Uganda and Turkey to determine student achievement. The researcher administered the questionnaire to 119 Ugandan and 85 Turkish high school teachers working in public and private schools in both countries. The researcher used Casual comparative research. The Mann–Whitney U test was used for data analysis. The findings show that Turkish teachers use many in-class assessment methods more often than Ugandan teachers. Compared to Turkish teachers, Ugandan teachers view themselves as more capable of giving student feedback but less competent in taking measures to increase objective scoring.

 abstract = {In recent years, webinar platforms have been broadly utilized in online learning where students meet one another synchronously online. This research’s underlying value is its recognition of the utmost importance of the awareness that online learning is a social process, as is all learning. This study aims to find out what kinds of synchronous collaborative online coaching pedagogy models have been used in previous research and proceeds to construct a preliminary pedagogical model for a coaching pedagogy for synchronous collaborative online learning (CPSCOL). The methods comprise a systematic literature review and qualitative-data and theory-driven content analysis. Through the systematic literature review, peer-reviewed articles spanning 2014–2018 are carefully examined. The results identify the following pedagogical framework, theory, and model combinations for synchronous collaborative online learning: the Community of Inquiry framework, including social, cognitive, and teaching presence; social presence in conjunction with the media synchronicity theory or the broaden-and-build theory, or the 4E Learning Cycle (engagement, exploration, explanation, and extension); no specific pedagogy; problem-based learning with Community of Inquiry framework or FISh (focus, investigate, and share); collaborative learning and collaborative learning connected to social presence; Carpe Diem with the Five-Step Model; and coaching pedagogy. The preliminary results indicate a scarcity of research on synchronous coaching pedagogy in online education. Consequently, the CPSCOL model for collaborative online learning, including cognitive, social, and teaching presence, is introduced to formulate a new perspective regarding webinar pedagogy. The process of learners, skills, and competences should factor in the pedagogical methods designed by a coach (teacher), and the results show that webinar pedagogy enables and enhances active collaborative learning and knowledge construction in groups. In addition, 18 CPSCOL principles of practice have been developed to support the practical implementation of the CPSCOL mode.},

 abstract = {Embedding ethics modules within computer science courses has become a popular response to the growing recognition that computer science programs need to better equip their students to navigate the ethical dimensions of computing technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and big data analytics. However, the popularity of this approach has outpaced the evidence of its positive outcomes. To help close that gap, this empirical study reports positive results from Northeastern University’s program that embeds values analysis modules into computer science courses. The resulting data suggest that such modules have a positive effect on students’ moral attitudes and that students leave the modules believing they are more prepared to navigate the ethical dimensions they will likely face in their eventual careers. Importantly, these gains were accomplished at an institution without a philosophy doctoral program, suggesting this strategy can be effectively employed by a wider range of institutions than many have thought.},

Firstly, it has shown an increasing trend year by year, and is mainly published in thematic journals such as educational technology, science education, and language teaching. Chinese and American researchers have made the greatest contributions in this field. Secondly, the algorithmic models for big data education evaluation research are diverse, the text modality is the most popular, the evaluation subjects are mainly college students, with fewer primary and secondary school students, and science is the discipline that most commonly applies big data education evaluation. The evaluation objectives of big data education evaluation mainly focus on five aspects: high-order thinking analysis, learning performance prediction, learning emotion recognition, teaching management decision-making, and evaluation mode optimization, and the text modality is widely used for data collection in high-order thinking analysis; regardless of the evaluation objectives, higher education students are the most widely evaluated objects; the science discipline is the main field of using big data technology to empower teaching evaluation. Thirdly, the current research topics of big data education evaluation mainly focus on online learning behavior and environmental participation evaluation, process assessment of learning motivation and emotional analysis, development and optimization of subject domain big data models, cognitive diagnosis and high-order thinking skills evaluation, and design of learning analysis frameworks based on data minin.},

 abstract = {In the context of formative assessment in classrooms, the incorporation of automated evaluation (AE) systems and teachers’ interactions with them hold significant importance. This study aimed to investigate the cognitive processes of pre-service teachers as they engaged with an AE system. We developed an unsupervised learning-based AE system, the Scoring Assistant using Artificial Intelligence (SAAI). SAAI calculates scores without relying on predefined labels and generates scientific keywords from student responses to provide constructive feedback. We collected a substantial number of constructed responses from students, and four pre-service teachers evaluated these responses initially without any external assistance and then re-evaluated them using SAAI scores as a reference point. Employing a mixed-methods approach, this study demonstrated a strong level of consistency between human raters and SAAI scores. Pre-service teachers also reflectively recalibrated their assessments and adjusted their rubrics to identify students’ learning more accurately. This study highlights the practical application of AE in real classroom settings and demonstrates how AE can enhance efficiency and accuracy in K-12 science assessments, thus supporting teachers.},

Fifty-nine studies met inclusion criteria and were analyzed against four research questions. Evidence highlighted their potential for supporting judgments about learning, informing instructional and learning decisions, and improving teacher learning and development. Although 23 studies measured student achievement, reporting positive overall effects, only 6 adopted the experimental designs necessary for causal claims. Using LP-based assessment for formative purposes was well supported. Limited evidence was found regarding summative and accountability uses. Findings show that LP-based assessment design and use requires trade-offs relating to standardization and scale. Teachers need opportunities for negotiation when making judgments and integrating LP-based assessments into existing curriculum and policy contexts. Future research should examine student use of LP assessments and find a balance between standardization and customization to meet the needs of diverse learners and local contexts.},

The literatures reviewed are known as data-driven decision making (DDDM), education data mining (EDM), and learning analytics (LA). DDDM is grounded in K–12 settings, has a social orientation, and is shaped by policy. EDM and LA began in higher education using data provided by instructional tools. This review of more than 1,500 publications traced patterns in these communities revealing disciplinary disconnects between DDDM and EDM/LA. Recognizing information’s systemic nature, this review expanded the analysis from teacher practice to educator practice. While methodological progress has been made in all areas, studies of impact were concentrated in DDDM. EDM and LA focus on tools for current/future educational settings and leveraging data harvested for basic research while reconceiving learning practices. The DDDM impact studies did not support a directly beneficial model for data use. Rather, long timescale capacity factors, including cultural and organizational processes that impact data use were revealed. A complementary model of components, infrastructure, and capacity is advanced with recommendations for scholarship in education’s sociotechnical future.},

Unlike sequential approaches that partition data first and then estimate average treatment effects (ATEs) within classes, we employ a Bayesian procedure to jointly estimate mixing probability, selection, and outcome models so that misclassification does not obstruct estimation of treatment effects. Simulation demonstrates that the proposed method finds the correct number of latent classes, estimates class-specific treatment effects well, and provides proper posterior standard deviations and credible intervals of ATEs. We apply this method to Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study data to investigate the effects of private science lessons on achievement scores and then find two latent classes, one with zero ATE and the other with positive ATE.},

 abstract = {Predicting students' academic performance is of paramount importance to educational institutions. If students' academic performance is predicted course-wise, semester-wise and year-wise then it will be helpful for students to a great extent. In this research article, we generate twenty nine dataset with the help of students' result analysis. Datasets 1 to 9 is the datasets of students' result in first attempt while datasets 10 to 19 represent datasets of students after passing all courses of semesters and datasets 20 to 29 is overall dataset of students' result analysis. To predict the course-wise, semester-wise and year-wise performance of students, we developed a framework titled as ECSYAPPS (Educational Course Semester Year-wise Academic Performance Prediction System) based on classification techniques and designed algorithm for analyzing students' performance in education sector. This ECSYAPPS predicts the course-wise, semester-wise and year-wise grade of students. Fifteen classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression (LR), Naive Bayes (NB), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machines (SVM), Linear Support Vector Classification (LSVC), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Gradient Boosting (GB), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), Bagging, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Light Gradient-Boosting Machine (LightGBM), Categorical Boosting (CatBoost), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier (SGDC) are selected and applied on 29 datasets and compared on basis of performance parameters such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). These fifteen classification algorithms are under ten classifiers such as Linear Model, Naive Bayes, Tree, Support Vector Machine, Nearest Neighbors, Ensemble, xgboost, lightgbm, Discriminant Analysis and catboost. If the accuracy of two more classification algorithms for a dataset is same then in that case Precision, Recall, F1-score and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) are compared for deciding the best classification algorithm for the dataset. In this way, best classification algorithm is selected for each of 29 datasets. It is found that classifiers xgboost works best for eleven datasets while ensemble techniques Gradient Boosting and AdaBoost work best for two datasets and six datasets respectively among 29 datasets. Other classification algorithms such as Decision Tree, LightGBM, LDA, and KNN are noted to be best classification algorithm for two, four, three, and two datasets respectively. This framework is tested on new eight datasets related to students' result two methods such as K-Fold Cross-validation and Train-Validation-Test method. The results of this framework on new datasets shows that accuracy obtained on test dataset or validation dataset as compared to the accuracy obtained on old dataset is less than 6%. This framework will be helpful for students as well instructor. For students, it will help them to improve the performance of difficult courses from students'point of view in the examination while faculty can use this framework to improve pedagogical practices.},

 abstract = {Identifying factors that lead students either not to graduate on time or drop out helps Higher Education Institutions improve retention and decrease attrition. This paper tackles this problem by introducing a novel approach to discovering such factors through pattern mining using association rules. The novelty of the method arises from introducing social network analysis inside the pattern mining process. The social networks metrics for each student and the degree of propagation of grade point average are computed and integrated with students’ records for pattern mining serving as a proxy for the existing bond among students, which is a relevant factor for attrition and dropout analysis. This paper examines the Bachelor Program in Production Engineering at the Federal Center for Technological Education of Rio de Janeiro from 2011 to 2017. Our experiments indicate congruence with the literature: (i) lower school performance leading to delay; (ii) higher performance leading to graduation in optimal time. Besides, our new method sheds light on students with little participation in the social network who are more likely to delay or drop out. Our findings may aid managers in discovering students with patterns that can indicate imminent lateness or dropout.},

To facilitate efficient transmission of presentations all paper presenters pre-recorded their presentation as a video and then hosted it on YouTube with closed-captioning (CC). The official theme of this year's conference is Improving Learning Outcomes for All Learners. The theme comprises two parts: (1) Identifying actionable learning or teaching strategies that can be used to "improve" learning outcomes, not just predict them; (2) Using EDM to promote more "equitable" learning across diverse groups of learners, and to benefit underserved communities in particular. This year's conference features three invited talks: Alina von Davier, Chief Officer at ACTNext; Abelardo Pardo, Professor and Dean of Programs (Engineering), at UniSA STEM, University of South Australia; and Kobi Gal, Associate Professor at the Department of Software and Information Systems Engineering at Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, and Reader at the School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh.},

The model uses these representations to predict student performance. We evaluate DPE on standard datasets from the literature, showing superior performance to the state-of-the-art systems in predicting whether or not students will answer a given question correctly. In particular, DPE is unaffected by the cold-start problem which arises when new students come to the system with little to no data available. We also show strong performance of the model when removing students' histories altogether, relying in part on contextual information about the questions. This strong performance without any information about the learners' histories demonstrates the high potential of using deep embedded representations of contextual information in educational data mining.

 abstract = {Data mining of course enrollment and course description records has soared as institutions of higher education begin tapping into the value of these data for academic and internal research purposes. This has led to a more than doubling of papers on course prediction tasks every year. The papers often center around a single prediction task and introduce a single novel modeling approach utilizing one or two data sources. In this paper, we provide the most comprehensive evaluation to date of data sources, models, and their performance on downstream prediction tasks. We separately incorporate syllabus, catalog description, and enrollment history data to represent courses using graph embedding, course2vec (i.e., skip-gram), and classic bag-of-words models. We evaluate these representations on the tasks of predicting course prerequisites, credit equivalencies, student next semester enrollments, and student course grades. Most notably, our results show that syllabi bag-of-words representations performed better than course descriptions in predicting prerequisite relationships, though enrollment-based graph embeddings performed substantially better still. Course descriptions provided the highest single representation accuracy in predicting course similarity, with descriptions, syllabi, and course2vec combined representations providing the highest ensembled accuracy on this task.

 abstract = {Online learning has attracted a large number of participants and is increasingly becoming very popular. However, the completion rates for online learning are notoriously low. Further, unlike traditional education systems, teachers, if any, are unable to comprehensively evaluate the learning gain of each student through the online learning platform. Hence, we need to have an effective framework for evaluating students' performance in online education systems and to predict their expected outcomes and associated early failures. To this end, we introduce Deep Online Performance Evaluation (DOPE), which first models the student course relations in an online system as a knowledge graph, then utilizes an advanced graph neural network to extract course and student embeddings, harnesses a recurrent neural network to encode the system's temporal student behavioral data, and ultimately predicts a student's performance in a given course. Comprehensive experiments on six online courses verify the effectiveness of DOPE across multiple settings against representative baseline methods. Furthermore, we perform ablation feature analysis on the student behavioral features to better understand the inner workings of DOPE.

 abstract = {Over the past decade, machine learning has become an integral part of educational technologies. With more and more applications such as students' performance prediction, course recommendation, dropout prediction and knowledge tracing relying upon machine learning models, there is increasing evidence and concerns about bias and unfairness of these models. Unfair models can lead to inequitable outcomes for some groups of students and negatively impact their learning. We show by real-world examples that educational data has embedded bias that leads to biased student modeling, which urges the development of fairness formalizations and fair algorithms for educational applications. Several formalizations of fairness have been proposed that can be classified into two types: (i) group fairness and (ii) individual fairness. Group fairness guarantees that groups are treated fairly as a whole, which might not be fair to some individuals. Thus individual fairness has been proposed to make sure fairness is achieved on individual level. In this work, we focus on developing an individually fair model for identifying students at-risk of underperforming. We propose a model which is based on the idea that the prediction for a student (identifying at-risk students) should not be influenced by his/her sensitive attributes. The proposed model is shown to effectively remove bias from these predictions and hence, making them useful in aiding all students. [For the full proceedings, see ED607784.]},

 abstract = {Predicting academic performance using trace data from learning management systems is a primary research topic in educational data mining. An important application is the identification of students at risk of failing the course or dropping out. However, most approaches utilise past grades, which are not always available and capture little of the student's learning strategy. The end-to-end models we implement predict whether a student will pass a course using only navigational patterns in a multimedia system, with the advantage of not requiring past grades. We experiment on a dataset containing coarse-grained action logs of more than 100,000 students participating in hundreds of short course. We propose two approaches to improve the performance: a novel encoding scheme for trace data, which reflects the course structure while remaining flexible enough to accommodate previously unseen courses, and unsupervised embeddings obtained with an autoencoder. To provide insight into model behaviour, we incorporate an attention mechanism. Clustering the vector representations of student behaviour produced by the proposed methods shows that distinct learning strategies specific to low- and high-achievers are extracted.

 abstract = {The aim of this work is to provide data-driven insights regarding the factors behind dropouts in Higher Education and their impact over time. To this end, we analyzed students' data collected by a Higher Education Institute over the last 11 years and we explored how socio-economic and academic changes may have impacted student dropouts and how these changes may have been reflected or captured by students' data. To analyze the data, we engineered features that may predict student dropouts on three dimensions: academic background, students' performance and students' effort. Then we carried out a correlation analysis to investigate the potential relationship between these features and dropouts, we performed a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) to investigate whether the engineered features change significantly among student cohorts with different admission year and, finally, we carried out a regression analysis to confirm that the engineered features' impact on predicting dropouts changes over the years. The results suggest that the importance of features regarding the academic background of students (such as the students' prior experience with the academic institution), and the effort students make (for example, the number of days students spend on academic leave) may change over time. On the contrary, performance-based features (such as credit points and grades) do interact with time suggesting that performance measures are stable predictors of dropouts over time. On the basis of the findings, we argue that the performance of prediction models for assessing students at risk of dropping out of their studies can be affected by the age of data and we outline the possibility of including a forgetting factor for non-recent data in order to leverage their impact on prediction performance.

 abstract = {The needs for precisely estimating a student's academic performance have been emphasized with an increasing amount of attention paid to Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS). However, since labels for academic performance, such as test scores, are collected from outside of ITS, obtaining the labels is costly, leading to label-scarcity problem which brings challenge in taking machine learning approaches for academic performance prediction. To this end, inspired by the recent advancement of pre-training method in natural language processing community, we propose DPA, a transfer learning framework with Discriminative Pre-training tasks for Academic performance prediction. DPA pre-trains two models, a generator and a discriminator, and fine-tunes the discriminator on academic performance prediction. In DPA's pre-training phase, a sequence of interactions where some tokens are masked is provided to the generator which is trained to reconstruct the original sequence. Then, the discriminator takes an interaction sequence where the masked tokens are replaced by the generator's outputs, and is trained to predict the originalities of all tokens in the sequence. We conduct extensive experimental studies on a real-world dataset obtained from a multi-platform ITS application and show that DPA outperforms the previous state-of-the-art generative pre-training method with a reduction of 4.05% in mean absolute error and more robust to increased label-scarcity.

 abstract = {Studying for entrance examinations can be a distressing period for numerous students. Consequently, many students decide to attend cram schools to assist them in preparing for these exams. For such schools and for all educational institutes, it is necessary to obtain the best tools to provide the highest quality of learning and guidance. Performance prediction is one tool that can serve as a resource for insights that are valuable to all educational stakeholders. With accurate predictions of their grades, students can be further guided and fostered in order to achieve their optimal learning goals. In this regard, we target middle school students to be able to guide them on their educational journey as early as possible. We propose a method to predict the students' performance in entrance examinations using the comments that cram school teachers made throughout the lessons. Teachers in cram schools observe their student's behavior closely and give reports on the efforts taken in their subject material. We show that the teachers' comments are qualified to construct a tool that is capable of predicting students' grades efficiently. This is a new method because previous studies focus on predicting grades mainly using student data such as their reflection comments or earlier scores. Experimental results show that using readily available feedback from teachers can remarkably contribute to the accuracy of student performance prediction. [For the full proceedings, see ED615472.]},

 abstract = {We address the problem of predicting the correctness of the student's response on the next exam question based on their previous interactions in the course of their learning and evaluation process. We model the student performance as a dynamic problem and compare the two major classes of dynamic neural architectures for its solution, namely the finite-memory Time Delay Neural Networks (TDNN) and the potentially infinite-memory Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN). Since the next response is a function of the knowledge state of the student and this, in turn, is a function of their previous responses and the skills associated with the previous questions, we propose a two-part network architecture. The first part employs a dynamic neural network (either TDNN or RNN) to trace the student knowledge state. The second part applies on top of the dynamic part and it is a multi-layer feed-forward network which completes the classification task of predicting the student response based on our estimate of the student knowledge state. Both input skills and previous responses are encoded using different embeddings. Regarding the skill embeddings we tried two different initialization schemes using (a) random vectors and (b) pretrained vectors matching the textual descriptions of the skills. Our experiments show that the performance of the RNN approach is better compared to the TDNN approach in all datasets that we have used. Also, we show that our RNN architecture outperforms the state-of-the-art models in four out of five datasets. It is worth noting that the TDNN approach also outperforms the state of the art models in four out of five datasets, although it is slightly worse than our proposed RNN approach. Finally, contrary to our expectations, we find that the initialization of skill embeddings using pretrained vectors offers practically no advantage over random initialization.

 abstract = {With the increasing adoption of Learning Management Systems (LMS) in colleges and universities, research in exploring the interaction data captured by these systems is promising in developing a better learning environment and improving teaching practice. Most of these research efforts focused on course-level variables to predict student performance in specific courses. However, these research findings for individual courses are limited to develop beneficial pedagogical interventions at the student level because students often have multiple courses simultaneously. This paper argues that student-centric models will provide systematic insights into students' learning behavior to develop effective teaching practice. This study analyzed 1651 undergraduate student's data collected in Fall 2019 from computer science and information systems departments at a US university that actively uses Blackboard as an LMS. The experimental results demonstrated the prediction performance of student-centric models and explained the influence of various predictors related to login volumes, login regularity, login chronotypes, and demographics on predictive models. Our findings show that student prior performance and normalized student login volume across courses significantly impact student performance models. We also observe that regularity in student logins has a significant influence on low performing students and students from minority races. Based on these findings, the implications were discussed to develop potential teaching practices for these students. [For the full proceedings, see ED615472.]},

 abstract = {Neural networks are ubiquitous in applied machine learning for education. Their pervasive success in predictive performance comes alongside a severe weakness, the lack of explainability of their decisions, especially relevant in humancentric fields. We implement five state-of-the-art methodologies for explaining black-box machine learning models (LIME, PermutationSHAP, KernelSHAP, DiCE, CEM) and examine the strengths of each approach on the downstream task of student performance prediction for five massive open online courses. Our experiments demonstrate that the families of explainers do not agree with each other on feature importance for the same Bidirectional LSTM models with the same representative set of students. We use Principal Component Analysis, Jensen-Shannon distance, and Spearman's rank-order correlation to quantitatively cross-examine explanations across methods and courses. Furthermore, we validate explainer performance across curriculum-based prerequisite relationships. Our results come to the concerning conclusion that the choice of explainer is an important decision and is in fact paramount to the interpretation of the predictive results, even more so than the course the model is trained on.

We examined: (1) how different ML algorithms influenced the precision of middle-school students' (N = 359) performance prediction; and (2) what types of in-game features were associated with student math knowledge scores. The results indicated that the Random Forest algorithm showed the best performance in predicting posttest math knowledge scores among the seven algorithms employed. Out of 37 features included in the model, the validity of the students' first mathematical transformation was the most predictive of their math knowledge scores.

 abstract = {Prediction of student performance in introductory programming courses can assist struggling students and improve their persistence. On the other hand, it is important for the prediction to be transparent for the instructor and students to effectively utilize the results of this prediction. Explainable Machine Learning models can effectively help students and instructors gain insights into students' different programming behaviors and problem-solving strategies that can lead to good or poor performance. This study develops an explainable model that predicts students' performance based on programming assignment submission information. We extract different data-driven features from students' programming submissions and employ a stacked ensemble model to predict students' final exam grades. We use SHAP, a game-theory-based framework, to explain the model's predictions to help the stakeholders understand the impact of different programming behaviors on students' success. Moreover, we analyze the impact of important features and utilize a combination of descriptive statistics and mixture models to identify different profiles of students based on their problem-solving patterns to bolster explainability. The experimental results suggest that our model significantly outperforms other Machine Learning models, including KNN, SVM, XGBoost, Bagging, Boosting, and Linear regression. Our explainable and transparent model can help explain students' common problem-solving patterns in relationship with their level of expertise resulting in effective intervention and adaptive support to students.

 abstract = {Recent research seeks to develop more comprehensive learner models for adaptive learning software. For example, models of reading comprehension built using data from students' use of adaptive instructional software for mathematics have recently been developed. These models aim to deliver experiences that consider factors related to learning beyond performance in the target domain for instruction. We investigate the extent to which generalization is possible for a recently developed predictive model that seeks to infer students' reading comprehension ability (as measured by end-of-year standardized test scores) using an introductory learning experience in Carnegie Learning's MATHia intelligent tutoring system for mathematics. Building on a model learned on data from middle school students in a single school district in a mid-western U.S. state, using that state's end-of-year English Language Arts (ELA) standardized test score as an outcome, we consider data from a school district in a south-eastern U.S. state as well as that state's end-of-year ELA standardized test outcome. Generalization is explored by considering prediction performance when training and testing models on data from each of the individual school districts (and for their respective state's test outcomes) as well as pooling data from both districts together. We conclude with discussion of investigations of some algorithmic fairness characteristics of the learned models. The results suggest that a model trained on data from the smaller of the two school districts considered may achieve greater fairness in its predictions over models trained on data from the other district or both districts, despite broad, overall similarities in some demographic characteristics of the two school districts. This raises interesting questions for future research on generalizing these kinds of models as well as on ensuring algorithmic fairness of resulting models for use in real-world adaptive systems for learning.

@article{ED633700,
 abstract = {Experience, whether personal or vicarious, plays an influential role in shaping human knowledge. Through these experiences, one develops an understanding of the world, which leads to learning. The process of gaining knowledge in higher education transcends beyond the passive transmission of knowledge from an expert to a novice. Instead, students are encouraged to actively engage in every learning opportunity to achieve mastery in their chosen field. Evaluation of such mastery typically entails using educational assessments that provide objective measures to determine whether the student has mastered what is required of them. With the proliferation of educational technology in the modern classroom, information about students is being collected at an unprecedented rate, covering demographic, performance, and behavioral data. In the absence of analytics expertise, stakeholders may miss out on valuable insights that can guide future instructional interventions, especially in helping students understand their strengths and weaknesses. This dissertation presents Web-Programming Grading Assistant (WebPGA), a homegrown educational technology designed based on various learning sciences principles, which has been used by 6,000+ students. In addition to streamlining and improving the grading process, it encourages students to reflect on their performance. WebPGA integrates learning analytics into educational assessments using students' physical and digital footprints. A series of classroom studies is presented demonstrating the use of learning analytics and assessment data to make students aware of their misconceptions. It aims to develop ways for students to learn from previous mistakes made by themselves or by others. The key findings of this dissertation include the identification of effective strategies of better-performing students, the demonstration of the importance of individualized guidance during the reviewing process, and the likely impact of validating one's understanding of another's experiences. Moreover, the Personalized Recommender of Items to Master and Evaluate (PRIME) framework is introduced. It is a novel and intelligent approach for diagnosing one's domain mastery and providing tailored learning opportunities by allowing students to observe others' mistakes. Thus, this dissertation lays the groundwork for further improvement and inspires better use of available data to improve the quality of educational assessments that will benefit both students and teachers.

Since the quality of the data has great influence on the accuracy of machine learning, five major data transmission methods are used to enhance data quality of log file in the data preprocessing stage. Furthermore, the modified FRBCS-CHI (fuzzy rule-based classification system using Chi's technique) algorithm, based on the weighted consequence, is proposed to improve the prediction accuracy of classification. Thereafter, the confusion matrix with two dimensions is employed to illustrate the prediction results, such as false positives, false negatives, true positives, and true negatives, which are further used to produce the parameters of prediction performance, including the precision rate, the recall rate, and the F-measure. From the results of experiment, the proposed modified FRBCS-CHI method will have higher prediction accuracy than the original FRBCS-CHI method.},

 abstract = {The measurement of student performance during their progress through university study provides academic leadership with critical information on each student's likelihood of success. Academics have traditionally used their interactions with individual students through class activities and interim assessments to identify those "at risk" of failure/withdrawal. However, modern university environments, offering easy on-line availability of course material, may see reduced lecture/tutorial attendance, making such identification more challenging. Modern data mining and machine learning techniques provide increasingly accurate predictions of student examination assessment marks, although these approaches have focussed upon large student populations and wide ranges of data attributes per student. However, many university modules comprise relatively small student cohorts, with institutional protocols limiting the student attributes available for analysis. It appears that very little research attention has been devoted to this area of analysis and prediction. We describe an experiment conducted on a final-year university module student cohort of 23, where individual student data are limited to lecture/tutorial attendance, virtual learning environment accesses and intermediate assessments. We found potential for predicting individual student interim and final assessment marks in small student cohorts with very limited attributes and that these predictions could be useful to support module leaders in identifying students potentially "at risk."},

However, when researchers applied machine learning to train a risk identifying model, the reason which affected the performance of the model was overlooked. This study collected seven datasets within three universities located in Taiwan and Japan and listed performance metrics of risk identification model after fed data into eight classification methods. U1, U2, and U3 were used to denote the three universities, which have three, two, and two cases of datasets (learning logs), respectively. According to the results of this study, the factors influencing the predictive performance of classification methods are the number of significant features, the number of categories of significant features, and Spearman correlation coefficient values. In U1 dataset case 1.3 and U2 dataset case 2.2, the numbers of significant features, numbers of categories of significant features, and Spearman correlation coefficient values for significant features were all relatively high, which is the main reason why these datasets were able to perform classification with high predictive ability.},

 abstract = {Prediction of student performance is one of the most important subjects of educational data mining. Artificial neural networks are seen to be an effective tool in predicting student performance in e-learning environments. In the studies carried out with artificial neural networks, performance predictions based on student scores are generally made, but students' use of learning management system is not focused. In this study, performances of 3518 university students, who studying and actively participating in a learning management system, were tried to be predicted by artificial neural networks in terms of gender, content score, time spent on the content, number of entries to content, homework score, number of attendance to live sessions, total time spent in live sessions, number of attendance to archived courses and total time spent in archived courses variables. Since it is difficult to interpret how much input variables in artificial neural networks contribute to predicting output variables, these networks are called black boxes. Also, in this study the amount of contribution of input variables on the prediction of output variable was also examined. The artificial neural network created as a result of the study makes a prediction with an accuracy of 80.47%. Finally, it was found that the variables of number of attendance to the live classes, the number of attendance to archived courses and the time spent in the content contributed most to the prediction of the output variable.},

 abstract = {Recently, tracking student behavior has become a very important phase for constructing adaptive educational systems. Several researchers have developed various methods based on machine learning for better tracing students' knowledge. Most of these methods have shown an effective estimation of student features and an accurate prediction of future performance. However, these methods recognized certain limitations since they use only the correctness of prior student responses to make predictions without paying attention to many other important student behaviors. In addition, researchers have only considered scaffolding items as a pure method of learning without having analyzed student performance at the time of answering these items. Our purpose in this article is to conduct an experiment that aims to evaluate how best to use data about the prior required scaffolding items to predict future student performance. For this reason, we proposed two separate models, namely, the first one identifies whether a student has previously required to use scaffolding items prior main question or has immediately answered it without requiring assistance. For the second model, as an improvement of model 1, our objective is to improve the student's performance under the constraint of answering scaffolding items. The performance of our two models is evaluated against the original Performance Factors Analysis algorithm to mark differences. The results show that the two proposed models provide a positive improvement in predicting the future performance of students. Moreover, our second model can reliably increase the predictive accuracy.},

 abstract = {Intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) teach skills using learning-by-doing principles and provide learners with individualized feedback and materials adapted to their level of understanding. Given a learner's history of past interactions with an ITS, a learner performance model estimates the current state of a learner's knowledge and predicts her future performance. The advent of increasingly large scale datasets has turned deep learning models for learner performance prediction into competitive alternatives to classical Markov process and logistic regression models. In an extensive empirical comparison on nine real-world datasets, we ask which approach makes the most accurate predictions and in what conditions. Logistic regression--with the right set of features--leads on datasets of moderate size or containing or containing a very large number of interactions per student, whereas Deep Knowledge Tracing leads on datasets of large size or where precise temporal information matters most. Markov process methods, like Bayesian Knowledge Tracing, lag behind other approaches. We follow this analysis with ablation studies to determine what components of leading algorithms explain their performance and a discussion of model calibration (reliability), which is crucial for downstream applications of learner performance prediction models.},

 abstract = {Student performance modelling is one of the challenging and popular research topics in educational data mining (EDM). Multiple factors influence the performance in non-linear ways; thus making this field more attractive to the researchers. The widespread availability of educational datasets further catalyse this interestingness, especially in online learning. Although several EDM surveys are available in the literature, we could find only a few specific surveys on student performance analysis and prediction. These specific surveys are limited in nature and primarily focus on studies that try to identify possible predictor or model student performance. However, the previous works do not address the temporal aspect of prediction. Moreover, we could not find any such specific survey which focuses only on classroom-based education. In this paper, we present a systematic review of EDM studies on student performance in classroom learning. It focuses on identifying the predictors, methods used for such identification, time and aim of prediction. It is significantly the first systematic survey of EDM studies that consider only classroom learning and focuses on the temporal aspect as well. This paper presents a review of 140 studies in this area. The meta-analysis indicates that the researchers achieve significant prediction efficiency during the tenure of the course. However, performance prediction before course commencement needs special attention.},

 abstract = {Contribution: This article explored blended learning by implementing a student-centered teaching method based on the flipped classroom and small private online course (SPOC). The impact of general online learning behavior on student performance was analyzed. This work is practical and provides enlightenment for learning analysis and individualized teaching in blended learning. Background: Providing individualized teaching in a large class is an effective way to improve teaching quality, but the traditional teaching method makes it difficult for teachers to learn about each student's learning situation. Blended learning offers the possibility of individualized teaching for teachers. The combination of flipped classroom and SPOC is a good way to implement blended learning, but few studies have verified the predictability of learning performance in such a scenario to explore individualized teaching. Intended Outcomes: Students' behavior in blended learning can be used to predict their learning outcomes, and the implementation method is reproducible. Teachers can implement individualized teaching in blended learning. Application Design: The learning activities were designed and reconstructed to create a blended learning scenario, data that depict students' learning behavior were collected and used to predict their performance by a multiple regression model. Student performance was measured by the final offline exam, and its predictability in the 1/4, 1/2, and 3/4 semester was tested for early intervention. Findings: The results show that students' online behavior can be predictors of their performance, and with the advance of the course, the predicted results are more stable and reliable.},

 abstract = {In 2017, the mathematics assessments that are part of the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) program underwent a transformation shifting the administration from paper-and-pencil formats to digitally-based assessments (DBA). This shift introduced new interactive item types that bring rich process data and tremendous opportunities to study the cognitive and behavioral processes that underlie test-takers' performances in ways that are not otherwise possible with the response data alone. In this exploratory study, we investigated the problem-solving processes and strategies applied by the nation's fourth and eighth graders by analyzing the process data collected during their interactions with two technology-enhanced drag-and-drop items (one item for each grade) included in the first digital operational administration of the NAEP's mathematics assessments. Results from this research revealed how test-takers who achieved different levels of accuracy on the items engaged in various cognitive and metacognitive processes (e.g., in terms of their time allocation, answer change behaviors, and problem-solving strategies), providing insights into the common mathematical misconceptions that fourth- and eighth-grade students held and the steps where they may have struggled during their solution process. Implications of the findings for educational assessment design and limitations of this research are also discussed.},

 abstract = {Aim/Purpose: This research aims to present a brand-new approach for student performance prediction using the Learning Fuzzy Cognitive Map (LFCM) approach. Background: Predicting student academic performance has long been an important research topic in many academic disciplines. Different mathematical models have been employed to predict student performance. Although the available sets of common prediction approaches, such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and regression, work well with large datasets, they face challenges dealing with small sample sizes, limiting their practical applications in real practices. Methodology: Six distinct categories of performance antecedents are adopted here as course characteristics, LMS characteristics, student characteristics, student engagement, student support, and institutional factors, along with measurement items within each category. Furthermore, we assessed the student's overall performance using three items of student satisfaction score, knowledge construction level, and student GPA. We have collected longitudinal data from 30 postgraduates in four subsequent semesters and analyzed data using the Learning Fuzzy Cognitive Map (LFCM) technique. Contribution: This research proposes a brand new approach, Learning Fuzzy Cognitive Map (LFCM), to predict student performance. Using this approach, we identified the most influential determinants of student performance, such as student engagement. Besides, this research depicts a model of interrelations among the student performance determinants. Findings: The results suggest that the model reasonably predicts the incoming sequence when there is a limited sample size. The results also reveal that students' total online time and the regularity of learning interval in LMS have the largest effect on overall performance. The student engagement category also has the highest direct effect on student's overall performance. Recommendations for Practitioners: Academic institutions can use the results and approach developed in this paper to identify students' performance antecedents, predict the performance, and establish action plans to resolve the shortcomings in the long term. Instructors can adjust their learning methods based on the feedback from students in the short run on the operational level. Recommendation for Researchers: Researchers can use the proposed approach in this research to deal with the problems in other domains, such as using LMS for organizational/institutional education. Besides, they can focus on specific dimensions of the proposed model, such as exploring ways to boost student engagement in the learning process. Impact on Society: Our results revealed that students are at the center of the learning process. The degree to which they are dedicated to learning is the most crucial determinant of the learning outcome. Therefore, learners should consider this finding in order the gain value from the learning process. Future Research: As a potential for future works, the proposed approach could be used in other contexts to test its applicability. Future studies could also improve the performance level of the proposed LFMC model by tuning the model's elements.},

Although prior studies have compared the efficacy of data mining methods (DMMs) in pipelines for forecasting student success, less work has focused on identifying a set of relevant features prior to model development and quantifying the stability of feature selection techniques. Pinpointing a subset of pertinent features can (1) reduce the number of variables that need to be managed by stakeholders, (2) make "black-box" algorithms more interpretable, and (3) provide greater guidance for faculty to implement targeted interventions. To that end, we introduce a methodology integrating feature selection with cross-validation and rank each feature on subsets of the training corpus. This modified pipeline was applied to forecast the performance of 3225 students in a baccalaureate science course using a set of 57 features, four DMMs, and four filter feature selection techniques. Correlation Attribute Evaluation (CAE) and Fisher's Scoring Algorithm (FSA) achieved significantly higher Area Under the Curve (AUC) values for logistic regression (LR) and elastic net regression (GLMNET), compared to when this pipeline step was omitted. Relief Attribute Evaluation (RAE) was highly unstable and produced models with the poorest prediction performance. Borda's method identified grade point average, number of credits taken, and performance on concept inventory assessments as the primary factors impacting predictions of student performance. We discuss the benefits of this approach when developing data pipelines for predictive modeling in undergraduate settings that are more interpretable and actionable for faculty and stakeholders.},

The recent development provides valuable tools for understanding the student learning environment by exploring and utilizing educational data using machine learning and data mining techniques. Modern academic institutions operate in a highly competitive and complex environment. Analyzing performance, providing high-quality education, strategies for evaluating the students' performance, and future actions are among the prevailing challenges universities face. Student intervention plans must be implemented in these universities to overcome problems experienced by the students during their studies. In this systematic review, the relevant EDM literature related to identifying student dropouts and students at risk from 2009 to 2021 is reviewed. The review results indicated that various Machine Learning (ML) techniques are used to understand and overcome the underlying challenges; predicting students at risk and students drop out prediction. Moreover, most studies use two types of datasets: data from student colleges/university databases and online learning platforms. ML methods were confirmed to play essential roles in predicting students at risk and dropout rates, thus improving the students' performance.},

 abstract = {Predicting students' learning outcomes is one of the main topics of interest in the area of Educational Data Mining and Learning Analytics. To this end, a plethora of machine learning methods has been successfully applied for solving a variety of predictive problems. However, it is of utmost importance for both educators and data scientists to develop accurate learning models at low cost. Fuzzy logic constitutes an appropriate approach for building models of high performance and transparency. In addition, active learning reduces both the time and cost of labeling effort, by exploiting a small set of labeled data along with a large set of unlabeled data in the most efficient way. In addition, choosing the proper method for a given problem formulation and configuring the optimal parameter setting is a demanding task, considering the high-dimensional input space and the complexity of machine learning algorithms. As such, exploring the potential of automated machine learning (autoML) strategies from the perspective of machine learning adeptness is important. In this context, the present study introduces a fuzzy-based active learning method for predicting students' academic performance which combines, in a modular way, autoML practices. A lot of experiments was carried out, revealing the efficiency of the proposed method for the accurate prediction of students at risk of failure. These insights may have the potential to support the learning experience and be useful the wider science of learning.},

 abstract = {Providing early predictions of academic performance is necessary for identifying at-risk students and subsequently providing them with timely intervention for critical factors affecting their academic performance. Although e-book systems are often used to provide students with teaching/learning materials in university courses, seldom has research made the early prediction based on their online reading behaviours by implementing machine learning classifiers. This study explored to what extent university students' academic achievement can be predicted, based on their reading behaviours in an e-book supported course, using the classifiers. It further investigated which of the features extracted from the reading logs influence the predictions. The participants were 100 first-year undergraduates enrolled in a compulsory course at a university in Taiwan. The results suggest that logistic regression supports vector classification, decision trees, and random forests, and neural networks achieved moderate prediction performance with accuracy, precision, and recall metrics. The Bayes classifier identified almost all at-risk students. Additionally, student online reading behaviours affecting the prediction models included: turning pages, going back to previous pages and jumping to other pages, adding/deleting markers, and editing/removing memos. These behaviours were significantly positively correlated to academic achievement and should be encouraged during courses supported by e-books.},

 abstract = {In recent times, Educational Data Mining and Learning Analytics have been abundantly used to model decision-making to improve teaching/learning ecosystems. However, the adaptation of student models in different domains/courses needs a balance between the generalization and context specificity to reduce the redundancy in creating domain-specific models. This paper explores the predictive power and generalization of a feature--"context-bound cognitive skill score"--in estimating the likelihood of success or failure of a student in a traditional higher education course so that the appropriate intervention is provided to help the students. To identify the students at risk in different courses, we applied classification algorithms on "context-bound cognitive skill scores" of a student to estimate the chances of success or failure, especially failure. The context-bound cognitive skill scores were aggregated based on the learning objective of a course to generate meaningful visual feedback to teachers and students so that they can understand why some students are predicted to be at risk. Evaluation of the generated model shows that this feature is applicable in a range of courses, and it mitigates the effort in engineering features/models for each domain. We submit that overall, "context-bound cognitive skill scores" prove to be effective in flagging the student performance when the accurate metrics related to learning activities and social behaviors of the students are unavailable.},

 abstract = {Education plays a major role in the development of the consciousness of the whole society. Education has been improved by analyzing educational data related to student academic performance. By using data mining techniques and algorithms on data from the educational environment, students' performances can be predicted. In this study, a novel Hybrid Ensemble Learning Algorithm (HELA) is proposed to predict the academic performance of students. The prediction results obtained from base classifiers namely Gradient Boosting, Extreme Gradient Boosting, Light Gradient Boosting Machine, and different combinations of these algorithms are given as input to the Super Learner algorithm. Hyper-parameters of base classifiers are optimized with a Random Search algorithm. Students' performances in Math and Portuguese classes are predicted by the proposed algorithm. In the experimental results, 96.6% and 91.2% accuracy values are obtained for the Mathematics course, and the Portuguese course, respectively. This paper is the first study, to our knowledge, to integrate the boosting and stacking-based ensemble learning algorithm for the prediction of students' academic performance that gives better predictive results with high efficiency.},

Thus, it is necessary to inspire educational scholars and educational technologists. This research therefore has three main targets: to educate the holistic context of rural education management, to study the relationship of continuing education at the upper secondary level, and to construct an appropriate education program prediction model for high school students in a rural school. The data for research is the academic achievement data of 1,859 students from Manchasuksa School at Mancha Khiri District, Khon Kaen Province, Thailand, during the academic year 2015-2020. Research tools are separated into 2 sections. The first section is a basic statistical analysis step, it composes of frequency analysis, percentage analysis, mean analysis, and standard deviation analysis. Another section is the data mining analysis phase, which consists of discretization technique, XGBoost classification technique (Decision Tree, Gradient Boosted Trees, and Random Forest), confusion matrix performance analysis, and cross-validation performance analysis. At the end, the research results found that the reasonable distribution level of student achievement consisted of four clusters classified by academic achievement. All four clusters were modeled on predicting academic achievement for the next generation of students. In addition, there are four success models in this research. For future research, the researcher aims to develop an application to facilitate instruction for learners by integrating prediction models into the mobile application to promote the utilization of modern technology.},

 abstract = {Higher education institutions often struggle with increased dropout rates, academic underachievement, and delayed graduations. One way in which these challenges can potentially be addressed is by better leveraging the student data stored in institutional databases and online learning platforms to predict students' academic performance early using advanced computational techniques. Several research efforts have focused on developing systems that can predict student performance. However, there is a need for a solution that can predict student performance and identify the factors that directly influence it. This paper aims to develop a model that accurately identifies students who are at risk of low performance, while also delineating the factors that contribute to this phenomenon. The model employs explainable machine learning (ML) techniques to delineate the factors that are associated with low performance and integrates rule-based model risk flags with the developed prediction system to improve the accuracy of performance predictions. This helps low-performing students to improve their academic metrics by implementing remedial actions that address the factors of concern. The model suggests proper remedial actions by mapping the students' performance in each identified checkpoint with the course learning outcomes (CLOs) and topics taught in the course. The list of possible actions is mapped to this checkpoint. The developed model can accurately distinguish students at risk (total grade < 70%) from students with good performance. The Area under the ROC Curve (AUC ROC) of binary classification model fed with four checkpoints reached 1.0. Proposed framework may aid the student to perform better, increase the institution's effectiveness and improve their reputations and rankings.},

 abstract = {Aim/Purpose: This paper presents a machine learning approach for analyzing Course Learning Outcomes (CLOs). The aim of this study is to find a model that can check whether a CLO is well written or not. Background: The use of machine learning algorithms has been, since many years, a prominent solution to predict learner performance in Outcome Based Education. However, the CLOs definition is still presenting a big handicap for faculties. There is a lack of supported tools and models that permit to predict whether a CLO is well written or not. Consequently, educators need an expert in quality and education to validate the outcomes of their courses. Methodology: A novel method named CLOCML (Course Learning Outcome Classification using Machine Learning) is proposed in this paper to develop predictive models for CLOs paraphrasing. A new dataset entitled CLOC (Course Learning Outcomes Classes) for that purpose has been collected and then undergone a pre-processing phase. We compared the performance of 4 models for predicting a CLO classification. Those models are Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, Naive Bayes and XGBoost. Contribution: The application of CLOCML may help faculties to make well-defined CLOs and then correct CLOs' measures in order to improve the quality of education addressed to their students. Findings: The best classification model was SVM. It was able to detect the CLO class with an accuracy of 83%. Recommendations for Practitioners: We would recommend both faculties' members and quality reviewers to make an informed decision about the nature of a given course outcome. Recommendation for Researchers: We would highly endorse that the researchers apply more machine learning models for CLOs of various disciplines and compare between them. We would also recommend that future studies investigate on the importance of the definition of CLOs and its impact on the credibility of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) values during accreditation process. Impact on Society: The findings of this study confirm the results of several other researchers who use machine learning in outcome-based education. The definition of right CLOs will help the student to get an idea about the performances that will be measured at the end of a course. Moreover, each faculty can take appropriate actions and suggest suitable recommendations after right performance measures in order to improve the quality of his course. Future Research: Future research can be improved by using a larger dataset. It could also be improved with deep learning models to reach more accurate results. Indeed, a strategy for checking CLOs overlaps could be integrated.},

All the courses in the bachelor's program were then divided into six typical categories, and the mean GPAs of each category were taken as primary input features for prediction. Three tree-based machine learning models were established, i.e. decision tree (DT), Gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT) and random forest (RF). Results show that we can successfully identify more than 80% of the students at low-performance risk using the RF model at the end of the second semester, which is meaningful because the global quality of teaching and learning of the department can be improved by taking targeted measures in time according to the machine learning model. Feature importance and the structure of decision tree were also analyzed to extract knowledge that is valuable for both students and teachers.

 abstract = {Educational data mining is an emerging interdisciplinary research area involving both education and informatics. It has become an imperative research area due to many advantages that educational institutions can achieve. Along these lines, various data mining techniques have been used to improve learning outcomes by exploring large-scale data that come from educational settings. One of the main problems is predicting the future achievements of students before taking final exams, so we can proactively help students achieve better performance and prevent dropouts. Therefore, many efforts have been made to solve the problem of student performance prediction in the context of educational data mining. In this paper, we provide readers with a comprehensive understanding of student performance prediction and compare approximately 260 studies in the last 20 years with respect to i) major factors highly affecting student performance prediction, ii) kinds of data mining techniques including prediction and feature selection algorithms, and iii) frequently used data mining tools. The findings of the comprehensive analysis show that ANN and Random Forest are mostly used data mining algorithms, while WEKA is found as a trending tool for students' performance prediction. Students' academic records and demographic factors are the best attributes to predict performance. The study proves that irrelevant features in the dataset reduce the prediction results and increase model processing time. Therefore, almost half of the studies used feature selection techniques before building prediction models. This study attempts to provide useful and valuable information to researchers interested in advancing educational data mining. The study directs future researchers to achieve highly accurate prediction results in different scenarios using different available inputs or techniques. The study also helps institutions apply data mining techniques to predict and improve student outcomes by providing additional assistance on time.},

It aims to provide insights into predictors of students' performance in English and Mathematics, characteristics of students with different levels of performance, the most effective DM technique for students' performance prediction, and the relationship between these two subjects. The study employed the archival data of students who were 16 years old in 2019 and sat for the Malaysian Certificate of Examination (MCE) in 2021. The learning of English and Mathematics is a concern in many countries. Three main factors, namely students' past academic performance, demographics, and psychological attributes were scrutinized to identify their impact on the prediction. This study utilized the Orange software for the DM process. It employed Decision Tree (DT) rules to determine the characteristics of students with low, moderate, and high performance in English and Mathematics subjects. DT and Naïve Bayes (NB) techniques show the best predictive performance for English and Mathematics subjects, respectively. Such characteristics and predictions may cue appropriate interventions to improve students' performance in these subjects. This study revealed students' past academic performance as the most critical predictor, as well as a few demographics and psychological attributes. By examining top predictors derived using four different classifier types, this study found that students' past Mathematics performance predicts their MCE English performance and students' past English performance predicts their MCE Mathematics performance. This finding shows students' performances in both subjects are interrelated.},

 abstract = {Technological advances have significantly affected education, leading to the creation of online learning platforms such as virtual learning environments and massive open online courses. While these platforms offer a variety of features, none of them incorporates a module that accurately predicts students' academic performance and commitment. Consequently, it is crucial to design machine learning (ML) methods that predict student performance and identify at-risk students as early as possible. Graph representations of student data provide new insights into this area. This paper describes a simple but highly accurate technique for converting tabulated data into graphs. We employ distance measures (Euclidean and cosine) to calculate the similarities between students' data and construct a graph. We extract graph topological features (GF) to enhance our data. This allows us to capture structural correlations among the data and gain deeper insights than isolated data analysis. The initial dataset (DS) and GF can be used alone or jointly to improve the predictive power of the ML method. The proposed method is tested on an educational dataset and returns superior results. The use of DS alone is compared with the use of DS+GF in the classification of students into three classes: "failed", "at risk", and "good". The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) reaches 0.948 using DS, compared with 0.964 for DS+GF. The accuracy in the case of DS+GF varies from 84.5 to 87.3%. Adding GF improves the performance by 2.019% in terms of AUC and 3.261% in terms of accuracy. Moreover, by incorporating graph topological features through a graph convolutional network (GCN), the prediction performance can be enhanced by 0.5% in terms of accuracy and 0.9% in terms of AUC under the cosine distance matrix. With the Euclidean distance matrix, adding the GCN improves the prediction accuracy by 3.7% and the AUC by 2.4%. By adding graph embedding features to ML models, at-risk students can be identified with 87.4% accuracy and 0.97 AUC. The proposed solution provides a tool for the early detection of at-risk students. This will benefit universities and enhance their prediction performance, improving both effectiveness and reputation.},

 abstract = {The COVID-19 pandemic induced a digital transformation of education and inspired both instructors and learners to adopt and leverage technology for learning. This led to online learning becoming an important component of the new normal, with home-based virtual learning an essential aspect for learners on various levels. This, in turn, has caused learners of varying levels to interact more frequently with virtual resources to supplement their learning. Even though virtual learning environments provide basic resources to help monitor the learners' online behaviour, there is room for more insights to be derived concerning individual learner performance. In this study, we propose a framework for visualising learners' online behaviour and use the data obtained to predict whether the learners would clear a course. We explored a variety of binary classifiers from which we achieved an overall accuracy of 80%-85%, thereby indicating the effectiveness of our approach and that learners' online behaviour had a significant effect on their academic performance. Further analysis showed that common patterns of behaviour among learners and/or anomalies in online behaviour could cause incorrect interpretations of a learner's performance, which gave us a better understanding of how our approach could be modified in the future.},

Meaningful features were generated from the process data to infer whether students spontaneously used calculators for mathematical problem solving, how frequently and when they used them, and the nature of the operations performed on calculators. Sequential pattern mining was applied on sequences of calculator keystrokes to obtain patterns of operations that were representative of students' problem-solving strategies or processes. Results indicated that higher scoring students not only were more likely to use calculators, but also used them in a more goal-driven manner than lower scoring students.},

 abstract = {The second CSEDM data challenge aimed at finding innovative methods to use students' programming traces to model their learning. The main challenge of this task is how to decide which past problems are relevant for predicting performance on a future problem. This paper proposes a set of weighting schemes to address this challenge. Specifically, students' behaviors and performance on past problems were weighted in predicting performance on future problems. The weight of a past problem was proportional to its similarity with the future problem. Problem similarity was quantified in terms of source code, problem prompts, and struggling patterns. In addition, we considered another weighting scheme where past problems were weighted by the order in which students attempted them. Prior studies have used problem similarity and order information in learner modeling, but the proposed weighting schemes are more flexible in capturing problem similarity on various problem properties and weighting various behaviors and performance information on past problems. We systematically investigate the utility of the weighting schemes on performance prediction through two analyses. The first analysis found that the weighting schemes based on source code similarity, struggling pattern similarity, and problem order improved the prediction performance, but the weighting scheme based on problem prompts did not. The second analysis found that the weighting scheme allows a simple and interpretable model, such as logistic regression, to have performance comparable to state-of-the-art deep-learning models. We discussed the implications of the weighting schemes for learner modeling and suggested directions for further improvement.},

 abstract = {Predicting student performance is crucial in higher education, as it facilitates course selection and the development of appropriate future study plans. The process of supporting the instructors and supervisors in monitoring students in order to upkeep them and combine training programs to get the best outcomes. It decreases the official warning signs and inefficient students' expulsions. Therefore, analysis of students' performance on various academic tests is critical for future skill development. Despite the fact that existing performance prediction systems based on Deep Learning (DL) technologies such as Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) have outperformed Machine Learning (ML) -based systems in the prediction task, there are still a few issues. Ignorance of relevant features, analysis limitations to the existing amount of data points, and ambiguity in student records are only a few of these issues. This research proposes a novel Student Academic Performance Predicting (SAPP) system to address these issues and enhance prediction accuracy. It has a better architecture that uses a combination of 4-layer stacked Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network, Random Forest (RF), and Gradient Boosting (GB) techniques to predict students' pass or fail outcomes. Additionally, the proposed SAPP system is compared to existing prediction systems using publicly accessible student OULAD dataset with an addition of self-curated emotional dataset. The performance of SAPP system is measured using Accuracy, Precision, F-measure, and Recall parameters. The results of proposed algorithm (LSTM + RF + B) is compared with LSTM + RF, LSTM + B and end to end DL models such as ANN, LSTM, RNN, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and most commonly utilized ML models in the literature such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), Naive Bayes (NB) and RF. The proposed SAPP system gained approximately 96% prediction accuracy that is comparatively higher than existing systems.},

 abstract = {Accompanied with the development of storage and processing capacity of modern technology, educational data increases sharply. It is difficult for educational researchers to derive useful information from much educational data. Therefore, educational data mining techniques are important for the development of modern education field. Recently, researches have demonstrated that machine learning, as an important tool for data mining, has shown promising performance in educational applications, especially in student performance prediction. However, few studies comprehensively compare existing machine learning methods in educational data. Moreover, most current studies only focus on a single type of educational data for student performance prediction. In this paper, three different types of task-oriented educational data are employed to investigate the performance of machine learning methods in different application scenarios. Specifically, seven parameter-optimized machine learning methods are implemented to study multiple types of performance prediction, including binary and multi-classification prediction tasks. In the experimental section, four evaluation metrics and visualizations are presented for a comparative study of different methods on three tasks, and an elaborated discussion of the experimental results is provided. The experimental results demonstrate that Random Forest has achieved superior generality on all selected datasets. In addition, the performance of Decision Tree and Artificial Neural Network models on the selected datasets indicates that they are also potential candidates to solve student performance prediction tasks.},

It adopts a C4.5 classification algorithm based on decision-tree analysis to examine 640 accounting students enrolled in an undergraduate accounting program at an Australian university. A significant contribution of this study is improved prediction of academic performance and identification of characteristics of students deemed to be at risk. By partitioning students into sub-groups based on tertiary entrance scores and employing clustering of study units, this study facilitates a more nuanced understanding of predictor attributes. Key findings were the dominance of a cluster of second year units in predicting students' later academic performance; that gender did not influence performance; and that performance in first year at university, rather than secondary school grades, was the most important predictor of subsequent academic performance.},

Additionally, it aims to predict learners' performance based on these interactions. The study involved 312 first-degree students specializing in transportation and technology engineering. The framework collects interaction data from discussion forums and chat rooms, conducts comprehensive data analysis, and constructs prediction models using supervised learning methods. The results unequivocally demonstrate that intra-group interactions significantly affect group performance in PBCL. The prediction model, with an accuracy metric of 0.92 and a final test score of 0.77, supports the credibility of the findings. Notably, the framework utilizes an ePortfolio specifically designed for group assessments, effectively managing both assessment and group data. This framework provides educators with a robust tool to assess group performance, identify areas requiring improvement, and contribute to shaping informed student learning outcomes. Furthermore, it empowers students by enabling them to receive feedback on their collaborative efforts, fostering enhanced interaction skills. These findings carry significant implications for the development and implementation of PBCL environments, offering educators valuable insights for evaluating student progress and making strategic decisions.},

 abstract = {Student performance is affected by their knowledge which changes dynamically over time. Therefore, employing recurrent neural networks (RNN), which are known to be very good in dynamic time series prediction, can be a suitable approach for student performance prediction. We propose such a neural network architecture containing two modules: (i) a dynamic sub-network including a recurrent Bi-GRU layer used for knowledge state estimation, (ii) a non-dynamic, feed-forward sub-network for predicting answer correctness based on the current question and current student knowledge state. The model modifies our previously proposed architecture and is different from all other existing models because it estimates the student's knowledge state considering only their previous responses. Thus the dynamic sub-network generates more stable knowledge state vector representations since they are independent of the current question. We studied both single-skill and multi-skill question scenarios and employed embeddings to represent questions and responses. In the multi-skill case the initialization of the question embedding matrix with pretrained word-embeddings is found to improve model performance. The experimental results showed that our current KT-Bi-GRU model and the previous one have similar performance while both surpassed the performance of previous state-of-the-art knowledge tracing models for five out of seven datasets where in some cases, the difference is quite noticeable.},

However, most of the proposed extensions have exclusively been improved in a pedagogical sense, as the improvements have mostly been limited to the analysis of students' behaviour during their learning process. In contrast, Machine Learning provides many powerful methods that could be efficient to enhance, in the technical sense, the prediction of student performance. Our goal is to focus on the exploitation of Ensemble Learning methods as an extremely effective Machine Learning paradigm used to create many advanced solutions in several fields. In this sense, we propose a new PFA approach based on different models (Random Forest, AdaBoost, and XGBoost) in order to increase the predictive accuracy of student performance. Our models have been evaluated on three different datasets. The experimental results show that the scalable XGBoost has outperformed the other evaluated models and substantially improved the performance prediction compared to the original PFA algorithm.},

The attainment of student outcomes in an Outcome-based Education (OBE) system adds invaluable rewards to facilitate corrective measures to the learning processes. Furthermore, the explosive increase of e-learning platforms generates a large volume of data that demands the extraction of useful information using up-to-date techniques. Keeping this view in mind and to check the impact of various features on student outcomes during online classes, we have analyzed two sets of datasets; the Kalboard 360 dataset (a larger dataset) that contains academic, demographic as well as behavioral features which have been observed and recorded during the classes held and a local Institute dataset that does not acquire behavioral features. To achieve this, we have selected a few machine learning algorithms such as Decision Tree (J48), Naïve Bayes (NB), Random Forest (RF), and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) to classify the students, along with a few filter-based feature selection methods like Info gain, gain ratio, and correlation features have been applied to select the key attributes. Finally, we have fine-tuned the learning parameters of MLP called "Opt-MLP" to get an optimized output and compared it with other classification models. Our experimental results conclude that Opt-MLP proves its superiority over other classification models by predicting an accuracy of 87.14% without the feature selection (WOFS) and 90.74% accuracy with the feature selection (WFS) method for data set 1 and an accuracy of 79.37% without feature selection and 97.08% with feature selection for dataset 2. But, when the students' behavioral feature is considered along with other features, the RF model provides 100% accuracy justifying that students' behavior during class hours has a great impact on attaining the students' outcomes.},

Researchers are keen to predict the academic performance of students; this is done to enhance the overall productivity of educational system by effectively identifying students whose performance is below average. This universal concern has been combined with data science leading to the creation of an interdisciplinary research area called Educational Data Mining. One of the recent issues which has been addressed by researchers is training generalizable models from different aspects such as gender, major, geography and etc. Therefore, in this research we use machine learning methods to predict student's performance, emphasizing on training generalizable models from geographical aspect. For this purpose, a questionnaire containing 37 questions was designed, through which 536 answers were collected, including 111 international and 425 domestic answers. According to the literature, student performance is mostly determined based on the GPA (grade point average) of the entire course. In this research, information about the GPA of respondents in undergraduate and graduate courses was collected in the form of three classes. After a final review of the models employed in previous studies, the main models selected and used for classification purposes included SVM, CNN, Adaboost, RF, SVM, and DT. Feature selection is performed using XGBoost, random forest, as well as SVML1. The main issue investigated in this study is the generalizability of the models trained on domestic (Iranian) data and tested on international data (non-Iranian). Experimental results show that the best models trained with specific dataset collected in this research had generalizability comparing to base models' outcomes which were trained and tested on domestic data. Meanwhile, Random forest and CNN models shows the best performance with the average of accuracy and F-score of 73.5 and 68.5, respectively.},

Therefore, identifying students who need support at an early stage and promptly providing appropriate intervention play a crucial role in preventing learning deficits. This study examined the longitudinal change in elementary school students' proficiency status to understand the nature of longitudinal transitions. It explored the feasibility of developing early predictive models for identifying students potentially facing academic difficulties based on information obtained from elementary school. Deep neural network and hierarchical generalized linear models were applied to large-scale national assessment panel data collected within the framework of an accountability system in South Korea. The results showed that although most students maintained their initial proficiency status, a substantial number of students made longitudinal transitions from non-proficiency to proficiency or vice-versa as they progressed from elementary to high school. The predictive models had an acceptable level of accuracy in predicting future academic performance, considering the degree of student mobility across proficiency levels over grades. The study concluded that the predictive models can serve as a starting point to identify students who need assistance and provide educators with a means to intervene promptly.},

We examined the effect of the self-regulated learning and personalized intervention on the learning performance of students. Compared with the traditional class tutoring, the personalized intervention review activity not only helped students obtain higher learning performance but also prompted greater improvements in the following learning strategies: rehearsal, critical thinking, metacognitive self-regulation, effort regulation, and peer learning.

The authors proposed a predictive model to identify the main fundamental components, consisting of one dependent variable (SAP) and five independent constructs. The suggested model is tested using partial least squares (PLS) and structural equation modeling (SEM), which perform better than covariance-based structural equation modeling (CB-SEM). PLS-SEM performs well with smaller sample sizes, even for complicated models. Findings: The study results show that the proposed model accurately predicted the student's academic performance. The personality trait variables are a key factor that determines the actual student's academic performance. The student's academic performance is significantly impacted by each variable in the personality trait variables as well. Originality/value: The process of validating research was done empirically through the accuracy and efficiency of model performance. The study differs from previous studies in that it accumulated a wide range of factors from different dimensions, including student demographics and personality trait factors. The authors developed a structural equation model to predict students' academic performance.},

 abstract = {The application of machine learning (ML) has grown and is now used to enhance learning outcomes. In blended classroom settings, ML, emerging smartphones and wearable technologies are commonly used to improve teaching and learning. The combination of these advanced technologies and ML plays a crucial role in enhancing real-time feedback quality. However, there are abundant scopes of improvement and strong need for further careful investigations in this area. We propose an "ML-based intelligent real-time feedback system" to address current research challenges for blended classrooms. The proposed system provides real-time feedback to students and teachers. We build an Android application for our intelligent feedback interfaces. The user interfaces use students' academic performance prediction models with real-time states and dynamic feedback timings based on historic feedback statistics. In addition, the feedback scheduling algorithms, choices of peripheral devices for real-time feedback, and feedback modalities to optimize fatigue make our system interfaces intelligent and novel. The end users well-received the intelligent features and technology of the proposed system. Our empirical findings indicate that unique design elements, such as dynamic timing, choice of peripheral devices, and modalities of real-time feedback, are crucial in integrating the system with blended classes. The intelligent characteristics of the proposed system have been appreciated by a large proportion of the end-users (90.90% of teachers and 84.21% of students) for use in real-time blended classroom environments. The higher comparative system usability scale (SUS) scores with benchmarks show real promise of the system design.},

 abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI), as an emerging technology, has been widely used in STEM education to promote the educational assessment. Although AI-driven educational assessment has the potential to assess students' learning automatically and reduce the workload of instructors, there is still a lack of review works to holistically examine the field of AI-driven educational assessment, especially in the STEM education context. To gain an overview of the application of AI-driven educational assessment in STEM education, this research conducted a systematic review based on 17 empirical research published from 2011 January to 2023 April. Specifically, this review examined the functions, algorithms, and effects of AI applications in STEM educational assessment. The results clarified three main functions of AI-driven educational assessment, namely academic performance assessment, learning status assessment, and instructional quality assessment. Moreover, the systematic review found that both traditional algorithms (e.g., natural language processing, machine learning) and advanced algorithms (e.g., deep learning, neural fuzzy systems) were applied in STEM educational assessment. Furthermore, the educational and technological effects of applying AI-driven educational assessment in STEM education were revealed. Based on the results, this research proposed educational and technological implications to guide the future practice and research of AI-driven educational assessment in STEM education.},

 abstract = {Today, the main aim of educational institutes is to provide a high level of education to students, as career selection is one of the most important and quite difficult decisions for learners, so it is essential to examine students' capabilities and interests. Higher education institutions frequently face higher dropout rates, low academic achievement, and graduation delays. One potential answer to these issues is to better leverage student data stored in institutional databases and online learning platforms to forecast students' academic achievements early by using artificial intelligence and advanced computer algorithms. Several research projects have been launched with the goal of building systems that can predict student performance. However, a system that can forecast student performance and identify the various factors that directly impact it is required. The purpose of this research work is to create a model that correctly identifies students who are in danger of low performance, as well as to identify the factors that contribute to this phenomenon and suggesting the remedial actions so as to reduce dropout rate and low performance among students. The emphasis of this study is to explore various factors that may affect mental health which lead to low performance or loss of interest in studies. The developed model can accurately identify at-risk students with over 96.5% accuracy using Machine learning techniques. This study focuses extensively on various factors apart from academics, such as personal and family factors and their association with student performance. To increase the accuracy of performance predictions, the model combines explainable Machine learning techniques to outline the factors associated with poor performance and discusses a novel framework that will help to increase the accuracy of prediction of the established prediction system. This assists low-performing students in improving their academic metrics by executing corrective actions that address the issues. The proposed novel framework, with the help of a mapping table, will recommend corrective actions along with visualization using the heatmap technique which may help the students to perform better in exams, increase the institution's effectiveness, and improves any country's economic growth and stability.},

This research explores new features that can help predict the future performance of undergraduate students and identify at-risk students early on. It answers some crucial and intuitive questions that are not addressed by previous studies. Most of the existing research is conducted on data from 2-3 years in an absolute grading scheme. We examined the effects of historical academic data of 15 years on predictive modelling. Additionally, we explore the performance of undergraduate students in a relative grading scheme and examine the effects of grades in core courses and initial semesters on future performances. As a pilot study, we analyzed the academic performance of Computer Science university students. Many exciting discoveries were made; the duration and size of the historical data play a significant role in predicting future performance, mainly due to changes in curriculum, faculty, society, and evolving trends. Furthermore, predicting grades in advanced courses based on initial pre-requisite courses is challenging in a relative grading scheme, as students' performance depends not only on their efforts but also on their peers. In short, educational data mining can come to the rescue by uncovering valuable insights from academic data to predict future performances and identify the critical areas that need significant improvement.},

 abstract = {The continuous development of Educational Data Mining (EDM) and Learning Analytics (LA) technologies has provided more effective technical support for accurate early warning and interventions for student academic performance. However, the existing body of research on EDM and LA needs more empirical studies that provide feedback interventions, and more attention should be paid to primary and secondary school students. This study proposed a data-driven precision teaching intervention mechanism combining EDM and LA technologies. The proposed mechanism aims to assist teachers in predicting students' academic performance and implementing corresponding interventions. This approach enables early warnings and reminders for students in crisis, and offers teaching assistance and support tailored to students at different levels. A quasi-experimental design was employed to examine the impact of the data-driven precision teaching intervention mechanism on secondary school students' learning outcomes. A total of 142 seventh-grade students participated in the intervention experiment, with an experimental group (50) receiving the data-driven precision teaching intervention, control group2 (48) receiving a group intervention stratified by teacher experience, and control group1 (44) receiving a traditional group intervention. Posttest data were collected after three rounds of intervention. Compared to the two control groups, students in the experimental group demonstrated superior academic achievement, intrinsic motivation, self-efficacy, and meta-cognitive awareness. These findings indicate that the data-driven precision teaching intervention approach positively impacted students' academic development, and effectively promoted their personalized learning. The findings provide pedagogical insights into the application of EDM in conjunction with LA prediction and actionable interventions.},

EDM has a primary focus on predicting students' academic performance. Numerous studies have been conducted for this purpose, but they are plagued by challenges including limited dataset size, disparities in grade distributions, and feature selection issues. This paper introduces a Machine Learning (ML) based method for the early prediction of bachelor students' final academic grade as well as drop-out cases. It focuses on identifying, from the first semester of study, the students requiring specific attention because of their academic weaknesses. The research employs nine classification models on students' data from a Saudi university, subsequently implementing a majority voting algorithm. The experimental outcomes are noteworthy, with the Extra Trees (ET) algorithm achieving a promising accuracy of 82.8% and the Majority Voting (MV) model outperforming all existing models by an accuracy reaching 92.7%. Moreover, the study identifies the factors exerting the greatest impact on students' academic performance, which belong to the three considered feature types: demographic, pre-admission, and academic.},

Focused on predicting academic success, the integration incorporates collaborative patterns from student data for increased accuracy. The method considers similar students' performance and behavior for nuanced, personalized predictions. Starting with diverse data collection, including collaborative patterns among students, Collaborative Filtering identifies relationships and patterns among those with similar academic histories.

The AIM model delineates student investment into four quadrants based on their time and energy commitment to academic pursuits, distinguishing between result-oriented and process-oriented investments. The findings reveal that the four-quadrant method surpasses machine learning clustering in predictive accuracy, highlighting the robustness of manual feature engineering. The study's significance lies in its potential to guide educators in designing targeted interventions and personalized learning strategies, emphasizing the importance of process-oriented assessment in education.

The developed prediction models classified students as either those who were likely to receive a distinctive or those who were likely to be at-risk or withdraw from the class. Although, the early prediction aid in the targeting of educational interventions and achieved a more efficient allocation of educational resources. All proposed solutions fell within the scope of predictions that result in active or proactive actions to support universities and learners. On the other hand, they fail to comprehend the various forms of education systems and whether it appropriate for the twenty-first century and future generations. The paper classifies education into five types based on the design mode, the scope of production, and the interaction between learners and educational systems (Push, Pull, coupling, Integrated, and Sustainable). The paper proposes a sustainable education paradigm that maximizes the knowledge and skill matrix accumulated for the desired program. The proposed theory implementation phases are modelled and demonstrated using 21st-century technologies, such as personalized and coaching education based on the learner’s learning style and remediation actions for strong learners with innovative competencies. The study emphasized various aspects of sustainable education systems that are required for smart city transition. The limitations and proposed solutions for dealing with anticipated issues were demonstrated, and the benefits of sustainable education are based on the proposed maximization theory rather than the current block-based learning of outcomes.},

 abstract = {E-learning, remote learning systems, and hybrid models were necessary in the pandemics age and when cities are rapidly moving towards smart city status. Adaptive and individualized education is now a must to reduce the drawbacks of distance learning while ensuring high levels of accomplishment. Technology such as machine learning, artificial intelligence (XAI), and data mining are all helping to transform education in a smart city by allowing for personalized learning and the ability to tailor content based on individual preferences. Based on the combination of XAI and IoB technologies, this study proposes a new paradigm for smart educational systems. Using data on students' actions, researchers try to establish whether or not contemporary educational systems meet students' needs. Education systems have evolved, but not to the point where they can be personalized to meet the cognitive demands of students and assist them when face-to-face instruction isn't available. Using evaluation methods, the study found that there has been a shift in students' academic progress when monitoring using IoT/IoB to enable a relative response in support of their progression. The system response to learners was 37%, once we involve the IoB in the processes and let students and the system be aware of the collected and used data about students' behaviours, the student's response improved to 76 % . This indicates the major influence of IoB on learner assistance and system adaptations to their real demands for higher achievement.},

The system integrates various features, including learners' personality, previous academic performance, current academic concepts progress, and soft skills. Machine learning algorithms are utilized to analyze the combination of data and identify patterns that predict a student's likelihood of falling behind. The proposed RADAR system employs a multi-modal approach, considering the learner's features. The system is trained on a dataset of students from a school district, where the data is collected and preprocessed accordingly. The feature selection algorithm is applied to identify the most relevant features that can accurately predict students at-risk of falling behind or dropping out. The pilot study establishes the framework of the system and examines the implementation implications. The results of this study indicate that the RADAR system achieves high accuracy in identifying at-risk students. Furthermore, the system effectively employs the identified features to predict students' performance in a continuous manner, enabling advisors, administrators, and students to take proactive measures to maintain high academic progress levels.

A simplified IGB model of the shallow UTES was developed using thermal network analysis. Experimental studies were conducted for shallow vertical and horizontal UTES configurations. Detailed models representing the field experiments were developed using the TRNSYS simulation tool and calibrated with the measured data from the experimental setup. The 4 Resistance 2 Capacitance (4R2C) IGB model was trained and tested in MATLAB using field experimental data and the data from the calibrated TRNSYS model. In comparing experimental data with the TRNSYS model for UTES, the prediction of outlet water temperature showed good agreement, with root mean square error (RMSE) and coefficient of variation of RMSE (CVRMSE) values of 0.94 °C and 3.16 % for vertical, and 0.99 °C and 2.97 % for horizontal configurations. The IGB model also aligned well with the experimental data, showing CVRMSE of 7.91 % and 3.17 % for vertical and horizontal systems, respectively. Sensitivity analysis revealed that model performance improves with longer training durations and closer testing times to training periods. However, a convergence point of 20 weeks of training data was achieved for making long-term performance predictions.},

We develop Indonesian Bigram Word Rule for Multi-label Student Complaints (Ina-BWR) to identify multi-label student problems based on Bigram Word Rule. Ina-BWR consists of three processes such as preprocessing informal text, identifying complaint and object from text. Additional preprocessing techniques are conducted to formalize the text such as parsing a hashtag, correcting affixes word, correcting a conjunction word, parsing suffix people pronoun and correcting typo words. Indonesian bigram word rule is adopted from opinion identification rules with 3 additional corpuses (-)NN, (-)JJ and (-)VB to identify student complaints. To identify complaints, four label corpuses have been created manually. The experimental results show that Ina-BWR can increase Personal, Subject and Relation label accuracies. The best accuracy for four labels is obtained when Ina-BWR is combined with BoW method.},

 abstract = {Knowing the potential students who will fail the final exam at early stages is very challenging but important for the decision-makers in the educational institutions to take proper actions to prevent them from failure. To accurately predict the secondary school student performance, we propose a double particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based categorical boosting (P2CatBoost) model based on the demographic, school period grades, and social/school related features. Considering the machine learning models are sensitive to their hyper-parameter settings, we introduce the PSO to optimize the fitness function. In addition, the threshold of a standard binary classification task is 0.5, which might not be the optimal value in real-world applications. Thus, we optimize this threshold by the PSO. To evaluate the performance of our proposed model, two datasets downloaded from the University of California, Irvine Repository and the Kaggle, respectively, are used. The experimental results showed that our proposed P2CatBoost has the best performance in terms of all the metrics used. Our proposed P2CatBoost has the best accuracy of 96.62% and 94.45% for the final grade prediction of the Mathematics and Portuguese courses, respectively. In addition, our proposed model outperforms the other models under comparison from 4.5% to 8.3%. The statistical analyses verify that our P2CatBoost can significantly outperform the comparing models. These results confirm the effectiveness of our double PSO for improving the performance of student performance prediction, indicating our proposed model could be a useful tool in educational institutions to improve the quality of education.},

 abstract = {This research work presents the preliminary classification and prediction of the research and academic performances of the university staff before evaluating the Research Assessment (RA) by implementing the Modified Naïve Bayes classification algorithm. In manual classification, the researcher and academic staff performances are observed by the person in charge who relates to the study and records the data. In experimental classification following these processes, first, the model is generated using training data set, next the model is tested with testing data set without at- tribute class. As a result of the study, the Modified Naïve Bayes classification can classify the academic performances with research activities better than the decision tree and ordinary Naïve Bayes, 96.15% and 94.23%, respectively. Nevertheless, this study result fits preliminary classification for university research office level before submitting to the respective national educational authority for further evaluation.},

 abstract = {Predicting student outcomes is essential in educational analytics for creating personalised learning experiences. The effectiveness of these predictive models relies on having access to sufficient and accurate data. However, privacy concerns and the lack of student consent often restrict data collection, limiting the applicability of predictive models. To tackle this obstacle, we employ Generative Adversarial Networks, a type of Generative AI, to generate tabular data replicating and enlarging the dimensions of two distinct publicly available student datasets. The ‘Math dataset’ has 395 observations and 33 features, whereas the ‘Exam dataset’ has 1000 observations and 8 features. Using advanced Python libraries, Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial Networks and Copula Generative Adversarial Networks, our methodology consists of two phases. First, a mirroring approach where we produce synthetic data matching the volume of the real datasets, focusing on privacy and evaluating predictive accuracy. Second, augmenting the real datasets with newly created synthetic observations to fill gaps in datasets that lack student data. We validate the synthetic data before employing these approaches using Correlation Analysis, Density Analysis, Correlation Heatmaps, and Principal Component Analysis. We then compare the predictive accuracy of whether students will pass or fail their exams across original, synthetic, and augmented datasets. Employing Feedforward Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, and Gradient-boosted Neural Networks, and using Bayesian optimisation for hyperparameter tuning, this research methodically examines the impact of synthetic data on prediction accuracy. We implement and optimize these models using Python. Our mirroring approach aims to achieve accuracy rates that closely align with the original data. Meanwhile, our augmenting approach seeks to reach a slightly higher accuracy level than when solely learning from the original data. Our findings provide actionable insights into leveraging advanced Generative AI techniques to enhance educational outcomes and meet our objectives successfully.},

 abstract = {The rapid proliferation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications in various domains of our lives has prompted a need for a shift towards a human-centered and trustworthy approach to AI. In this study we employ the Assessment List for Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence (ALTAI) checklist to evaluate the trustworthiness of Artificial Intelligence for Student Performance Prediction (AI4SPP), an AI-powered system designed to detect students at risk of school failure. We strongly support the ethical and legal development of AI and propose an implementation design where the user can choose to have access to each level of a three-tier outcome bundle: the AI prediction alone, the prediction along with its confidence level, and, lastly, local explanations for each grade prediction together with the previous two information. AI4SPP aims to raise awareness among educators and students regarding the factors contributing to low school performance, thereby facilitating the implementation of interventions not only to help students, but also to address biases within the school community. However, we also emphasize the ethical and legal concerns that could arise from a misuse of the AI4SPP tool. First of all, the collection and analysis of data, which is essential for the development of AI models, may lead to breaches of privacy, thus causing particularly adverse consequences in the case of vulnerable individuals. Furthermore, the system’s predictions may be influenced by unacceptable discrimination based on gender, ethnicity, or socio-economic background, leading to unfair actions. The ALTAI checklist serves as a valuable self-assessment tool during the design phase of AI systems, by means of which commonly overlooked weaknesses can be highlighted and addressed. In addition, the same checklist plays a crucial role throughout the AI system life cycle. Continuous monitoring of sensitive features within the dataset, alongside survey assessments to gauge users’ responses to the systems, is essential for gathering insights and intervening accordingly. We argue that adopting a critical approach to AI development is essential for societal progress, believing that it can evolve and accelerate over time without impeding openness to new technologies. By aligning with ethical principles and legal requirements, AI systems can make significant contributions to education while mitigating potential risks and ensuring a fair and inclusive learning environment.},

 abstract = {The rapid growth of educational data creates the requirement to mine useful information from learning behavior patterns. The development of data mining technology makes educational data mining possible. The paper intends to use a public educational data set to study learning behavior patterns from the perspective of educational data mining, so as to promote the innovation of educational management. Firstly, in order to reduce the dimension of data analysis that facilitates the improvement in efficiency, principal component analysis is carried out to reduce the number of attributes in the data set. The significant attributes in the rotating principal component matrix rather than principal components which are not closely related to learning behavior patterns are extracted as the research variables. Then, a pseudo statistic is proposed to determine the number of clusters and the preprocessed data set is clustered according to the extracted attributes. The clustering results are applied to add class labels to the data, which is convenient for the later data training. Finally, six classification algorithms J48, K-Nearest Neighbor, Bayes Net, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine and Logit Boost are used to train the data with labels and build prediction models. At the same time, the performance and applicable conditions of six classifiers in terms of accuracy, efficiency, error, and so on are discussed and compared. It is found that the performance of the integrated algorithm is better than that of a single classifier. In the integrated algorithm, compared with Random Forest, the running time of Logit Boost is shorter.},

 abstract = {Teaching games are an effective teaching organization activity. In response to the evaluation and prediction problem of teaching games, a teaching game evaluation model based on improved sparrow search algorithm and back propagation neural network was studied and constructed. Firstly, a situational teaching game was designed and an evaluation index system was constructed. Then, a teaching game evaluation prediction model based on the improved method was established. Finally, the expert consultation method is adopted to collect opinions from experts in the field of education and construct an evaluation index system for teaching games. And based on the evaluation index system of teaching games, evaluate students’ mathematical thinking ability before and after experiencing teaching games to verify the application effect of teaching games. The scenario based teaching game designed in this study has a certain effect on improving students’ mathematical thinking ability. Students’ mathematical thinking has significantly improved (P<0.05), and the teaching effect is the same for students of different genders (P>0.1). The improved sparrow search algorithm has a faster convergence rate than other algorithms, and tends to be stable when iteration is about 100 when solving the single peak benchmark function. When solving the multimodal benchmark test function, it tends to stabilize when iteration is around 20. The teaching game evaluation prediction price model based on the improved method shows a trend of first increasing and then decreasing with hidden units increasing. When the hidden unit is 16, the area index under model curve is the highest, around 0.962, and its prediction accuracy is relatively high. In summary, the model constructed in this study is applicating good in teaching game evaluation prediction, and can promote education industry developing.},

Initially, we performed a descriptive statistical analysis to gain insight from data. Subsequently, two datasets were obtained. The first dataset contains variables obtained prior to the start of the school year, and the second included academic variables collected two months after the semester began. Classification models based on the Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) were created to predict academic outcomes of student performance at the end of the school year for each dataset. Results showed that, though the attributes ‘grades' and ‘absences' were the most relevant for predicting the end of the year academic outcomes of student performance, the analysis of demographic attributes reveals that ‘neighborhood’, ‘school’ and ‘age’ are also potential indicators of a student's academic success or failure.},

The main objective of the current paper is to explore and propose a Deep Neural Network (DNN) framework for binary classification with two hidden layers, for the early prediction of teams’ performance in the domain of software engineering. The framework was evaluated by using different activation functions (Sigmoid, ReLu, and Tanh) and optimizers (Adagrad and Adadelta). A dataset created from over 30000 entries grouped in 74 teams was used for training and evaluating the framework. Additionally, the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) approach was used to interpret the framework and extract the most important features having a positive or negative impact on its final prediction. Among other conclusions, it was shown that the prediction accuracy of the framework, when the Adadelta and Adagrad optimizers were used, was found to be 76.73% and 82.39%, respectively, while its overall learning performance was 80.76% and 86.57%, meaning that it is capable of predicting teams’ performance adequately and accurately.},

 abstract = {Problem:
Educational disparities in Mathematics performance are a persistent challenge. This study aims to unravel the complex factors contributing to these disparities among students internationally, with a focus on the interpretability of the contributing factors.
Methodology:
Utilizing data from the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA), we conducted rigorous preprocessing and variable selection to prepare for applying binary classification interpretability models. These models were trained using the Stratified K-Fold technique to ensure balanced representation and assessed using six key metrics.
Solution:
By applying interpretability models such as Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) analysis, we identified critical factors impacting student performance, including reading accessibility, critical thinking skills, gender, and geographical location.
Results:
Our findings reveal significant disparities linked to resource availability, with students from lower socioeconomic backgrounds possessing fewer books and demonstrating lower performance in Mathematics. The geographical analysis highlighted regional educational disparities, with certain areas consistently underperforming in PISA assessments. Gender also emerged as a determinant, with females contributing differently to performance levels across the spectrum.
Conclusion:
The study provides insights into the multifaceted determinants of student Mathematics performance and suggests potential avenues for future research to explore global interpretability models and further investigate the socioeconomic, cultural, and educational factors at play.},

 abstract = {This study aims to comprehensively analyze and evaluate the quality of college physical dance education using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models and deep learning methods. The study introduces a teaching quality evaluation (TQE) model based on one-dimensional CNN, addressing issues such as subjectivity and inconsistent evaluation criteria in traditional assessment methods. By constructing a comprehensive TQE system comprising 24 evaluation indicators, this study innovatively applies deep learning technology to quantitatively assess the quality of physical dance education. This TQE model processes one-dimensional evaluation data by extracting local features through convolutional layers, reducing dimensions via pooling layers, and feeding feature vectors into a classifier through fully connected layers to achieve an overall assessment of teaching quality. Experimental results demonstrate that after 150 iterations of training and validation on the TQE model, convergence is achieved, with mean squared error (MSE) decreasing to 0.0015 and 0.0216 on the training and validation sets, respectively. Comparatively, the TQE model exhibits significantly lower MSE on the training, validation, and test sets compared to the Back-Propagation Neural Network, accompanied by a higher R2 value, indicating superior accuracy and performance in data fitting. Further analysis on robustness, parameter sensitivity, multi-scenario adaptability, and long-term learning capabilities reveals the TQE model's strong resilience and stability in managing noisy data, varying parameter configurations, diverse teaching contexts, and extended time-series data. In practical applications, the TQE model is implemented in physical dance courses at X College to evaluate teaching quality and guide improvement strategies for instructors, resulting in notable enhancements in teaching quality and student satisfaction. In conclusion, this study offers a comprehensive evaluation of university physical dance education quality through a multidimensional assessment system and the application of the 1D-CNN model. It introduces a novel and effective approach to assessing teaching quality, providing a scientific foundation and practical guidance for future educational advancements.},

Performance data retrieved from historical interactions is the main engine for learner performance prediction, where the likelihood of the learner answering correctly future questions is calculated. Modeling learner performance can provide significant insights into individual students to promote successful learning and maximize educational achievement. This study aims to enhance the learner performance prediction of some logistic regression-based models, namely Item Response Theory, Performance Factor Analysis, and DAS3H using XGBoost, including an empirical comparison of eight real-world datasets, containing performance log data collected from different online intelligent tutoring systems, involving the first time a new dataset from Moodle Morocco. The results have demonstrated that the XGBoost has enhanced PFA predictive performance on seven datasets with an AUC of up 0.88 and improved the DAS3H AUC on the ASSISTment17 dataset while conserving almost the same predictive results for Item Response Theory on some datasets.},

 abstract = {Over the past two decades, studying the various factors affecting student performance became essential. Knowing these factors assist in enhancing student’s performance, teaching practices and policy decisions. This research proposes a framework named “Semantic-based Modeling Framework for Student Outcome Prediction” (SMFSOP), to automatically map students’ activities within their learning environment to a standardized behavioral model (Community of Inquiry model (CoI)). The generated student representation is utilized to cluster students and predict an outcome based on their cluster. The framework is divided into three phases: Data gathering and pre-processing, automated mapping, clustering and prediction. The automatic mapping uses semantic similarity between student attribute names/descriptions, and CoI model indicators. Path and BERT similarities were identified as the best performers compared to human annotators. K-means, DBSCAN, and Kernel K-means are used for the clustering step, followed by LassoCV for regression-based prediction, & K-nearest neighbors for classification-based prediction. In order to prove that the proposed framework is generally applicable, three real life datasets were used as a case study. Best-performing trials enhanced outcome prediction as follows: In StudentLife Dataset, Adjusted R2 is enhanced by 3% (95% to 98%), and MSE decreased by 2.375 % (0.126 to 0.031). In social network dataset, Adjusted R2 was enhanced by 17% (65% to 82%). The MSE decreased by 4.4% (0.164 to 0.12). For the “Open university learning Analytics dataset” (OULAD), accuracy is improved by 1.56%, F1-score enhanced by 0.014. Precision is enhanced by 3.1%.},

The application of digital twins in sport has brought dramatic changes not only in the domain of sport training, but also in managing athletes during competitions, searching for strategical solutions before and tactical solutions during the games by coaches. In this paper, the domain of digital twins in sport is reviewed based on papers which have emerged in this area. At first, the concept of a digital twin is discussed in general. Then, taxonomies of digital twins are appointed. According to these taxonomies, the collection of relevant papers is analyzed, and some real examples of digital twins are exposed. The review finishes with a discussion about how the digital twins affect changes in the modern sport disciplines, and what challenges and opportunities await the digital twins in the future.},

One key challenge is that a player may deploy several interweaved and overlapped skills during gameplay, making the assessment task nontrivial. In this research, we present a generalizable DKT approach called GameDKT that integrates state-of-the-art machine learning with domain knowledge to model the learners’ knowledge state during gameplay, in an attempt to monitor and trace their proficiency level for the different skills required for educational games. Our findings reveal that GameDKT approach could successfully predict the performance of players in the coming game task using the cross-validated CNN model with accuracy and AUC of roughly 85% and 0.913, respectively, thus outperforming the MLP baseline model by up to 14%. When the performance of players is forecasted for up to four game tasks in advance, results show that the CNN model can achieve more than 70% accuracy. Interestingly, this model seems to be better and faster at identifying local patterns and it could achieve a higher performance compared to RNN and LSTM in both one-step and multi-step prediction of learners’ performance in game tasks.},

In response, educational institutions have rapidly expanded their virtual course offerings and assessment methods. One significant challenge in the realm of online education is the effective assessment of student involvement, engagement, and attentiveness during virtual classes. To address this challenge, we introduce a specialized system tailored to identifying and comprehending the complex range of student behaviors exhibited during online classes. Our system takes into account the diverse contexts and individual considerations that shape students' responses to the online learning environment. It employs user authentication through facial recognition technology and seamlessly integrates vital components, including facial detection, hand tracking, mobile phone detection, and pose estimation modules. Leveraging these components, we extract high-level features to construct a comprehensive dataset for training machine-learning models designed to detect students' attention levels during online classes. After evaluating six prominent machine learning algorithms, we have selected the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithm, which demonstrated an impressive 99.75% accuracy on the test data. Finally, the system generates a comprehensive anonymous report on the level of attentiveness of students, accessible through a dedicated webpage that includes a summary of the behavior of students throughout online classes, providing valuable insights for personalized interventions and enhanced online learning experiences.},

 abstract = {Studies have demonstrated that stochastic configuration networks (SCNs) have good potential for rapid data modeling because of their sufficient adequate learning power, which is theoretically guaranteed. Empirical studies have verified that the learner models produced by SCNs can usually achieve favorable test performance in practice but more in-depth theoretical analysis of their generalization power would be useful for constructing SCN-based ensemble models with enhanced generalization capacities. In particular, given a collection of independently developed SCN-based learner models, it is useful to select certain base learners that can potentially obtain preferable test results rather than considering all of the base models together, before simply taking their average in order to build an effective ensemble model. In this study, we propose a novel framework for building SCN ensembles by exploring key factors that might potentially affect the generalization performance of the base model. Under a mild assumption, we provide a comprehensive theoretical framework for examining a learner model’s generalization error, as well as formulating a novel indicator that contains measurement information for the training errors, output weights, and a hidden layer output matrix, which can be used by our proposed algorithm to find a subset of appropriate base models from a pool of randomized learner models. A toy example of one-dimensional function approximation, a case study for developing a predictive model for forecasting student learning performance, and two large-scale data sets were used in our experiments. The experimental results indicate that our proposed method has some remarkable advantages for building ensemble models.},

 abstract = {Cognitive diagnostics is a pivotal area within educational data mining, focusing on deciphering students’ cognitive status via their academic performance. Traditionally, cognitive diagnostic models (CDMs) have evolved from manually designed probabilistic graphical models to sophisticated automated learning models employing neural networks. Despite their enhanced fitting capabilities, contemporary neuro-cognitive diagnostic models frequently overlook critical process information from students and suffer from reduced interpretability. To address these limitations, this paper introduces a neuro-cognitive diagnostic model that integrates multidimensional features (MFNCD) by incorporating students’ response time as process information. This approach facilitates the simultaneous modeling of students’ response accuracy and response speed using neural networks, thereby enhancing both the fitting capability and precision of the method. Furthermore, a multi-channel attention mechanism is employed to effectively capture the complex interactions between students and exercise characteristics, simulating the process of students answering questions and thereby improving the model's interpretability. Validated on four diverse datasets, MFNCD model demonstrates superior accuracy compared to other state-of-the-art (SOAT) baseline models. Additionally, our experiments confirm significant correlations between cognitive attributes, revealing interesting educational patterns, such as a positive correlation between speed and ability, and between ability and accuracy. These findings provide deeper insights into learning patterns that incorporate multidimensional features and suggest potential pathways for targeted educational interventions.},

In this paper, we propose a long short-term attentional cognitive diagnostic (LS-ENCD) model for skill growth assessment in intelligent tutoring systems. Specifically, we first embed exercise and student features into high-dimensional vectors. Then, we use a measurement module with a bilayer architecture to establish the interaction between students and exercises, considering guessing and slipping factors. To capture long short-term dependencies on historical data, we design the long short-term learning transfer module based on the attention mechanism, which computes state transfer weights by incorporating occasion time and mastery state.

 abstract = {The primary objective of knowledge tracing (KT) is to trace learners’ changing knowledge states and predict their future performance by analyzing their learning trajectories. One of the fundamental assumptions underpinning KT is that estimating knowledge states is roughly equivalent to predicting future performance. However, this assumption has not been extensively explored in most studies, particularly in relation to the consistency between observable performance and latent knowledge state. To address this challenge, we propose a novel response speed enhanced fine-grained knowledge tracing (FKT) method. FKT leverages response speed through response time and integrates speed prediction as an additional task within a multi-task learning framework. Through this framework, FKT can separate representations of different knowledge state in the feature space, thereby facilitating fine-grained knowledge tracing. Moreover, we divide the task of predicting learner performance into three procedures: obtaining historical knowledge state, inferring future latent traits, and forecasting future performance. To this end, we formalize each learner’s response interaction as a time cell and develop an encoder–decoder–predictor framework for KT. To enhance the accuracy of performance prediction, we introduce a time-distance attention mechanism and knowledge proficiency component and provide two multi-task objective functions. Our experimental results on four real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of future performance prediction and good interpretability of FKT.},

 abstract = {Educators dynamically adjust their teaching strategies by tracing the development of students’ knowledge states. Knowledge Tracing (KT) plays a role similar to that of educators in online teaching. By analyzing past performances, KT identifies learners’ knowledge states and predicts the outcomes of future exercises. However, the existing KT models assume that the learner’s performance is a binary variable (i.e., correct or incorrect) without refining learner performance or differentiating knowledge states. Multiple-choice tests employ distractors that engage learners in different knowledge states, with each distraction implying a specific error. In multiple-choice exercises, we propose an option-weighting-enhanced mixture-of-expert knowledge tracing (WEKT) method that assigns weights to different options based on improved option weighting scoring. The option weights affirm partial knowledge and refine the knowledge state. Building on the multi-task learning strategy, we design a mixture-of-experts framework that simultaneously predicts correctness and options, traces students’ specific errors, and refines students’ performances. The expert structure combines cognitive theory with deep learning technology, taking into consideration the differences between experts and students. Extensive experiments on large-scale datasets indicate that WEKT can refine knowledge states and attain more precise predictions of student performance.},

Some difficulties confronting most schools are delivering high-quality education to the students, developing systems for evaluating student performance, analyzing performance, and recognizing the future demands of their learners. Also, due to the paradigm shift due to the computerization of school data management, educational stakeholders, including the machine learning (ML) community, have taken an interest in analyzing performance traits using academic and non-academic factors. This systematic literature review identifies various machine learning methods based on 84 selected publications. It shows how researchers have been able to pattern-map student characteristics and their influence on school performance. An attempt is made to answer how the overall study coverage of student characteristics and the ML methods are employed to predict students’ performance. An analysis of the 84 papers highlights that, student characteristics predominantly influencing performance are academic and demographic attributes. The study further shows that classification and decision trees are the most widely used methods and algorithms. The review also reveals population and practical knowledge gaps due to a lack of research on basic academic performance and prescription of intervention plans for averting poor performance through mapping these influential characteristics to student accomplishment. To bridge these perceived gaps, the scope of the population sample needs a benchmarked dataset and embedding the appropriate intervention outlines that will map the learner’s performance early in their school life.},

 abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) has the potential to significantly impact the educational sector. One application of AI that has increasingly been applied is algorithmic grading. It is within this context that our study takes a focus on trust. While the concept of trust continues to grow in importance among AI researchers and practitioners, an investigation of trust/mistrust in algorithmic grading across multiple levels of analysis has so far been under-researched. In this paper, we argue the need for a model that encompasses the multi-layered nature of trust/mistrust in AI. Drawing on an embedded agency perspective, a model is devised that examines top-down and bottom-up forces that can influence trust/mistrust in algorithmic grading. We illustrate how the model can be applied by drawing on the case of the International Baccalaureate (IB) program in 2020, whereby an algorithm was used to determine student grades. This paper contributes to the AI-trust literature by providing a fresh theoretical lens based on institutional theory to investigate the dynamic and multi-faceted nature of trust/mistrust in algorithmic grading—an area that has seldom been explored, both theoretically and empirically. The study raises important implications for algorithmic design and awareness. Algorithms need to be designed in a transparent, fair, and ultimately a trustworthy manner. While an algorithm typically operates like a black box, whereby the underlying mechanisms are not apparent to those impacted by it, the purpose and an understanding of how the algorithm works should be communicated upfront and in a timely manner.},

The ANOVA results for the Skin Conductance Responses (SCRs) analysis indicated the disparity of physiological behavior activated in relation to different types of interactions for regulation.

By testing the proposed methodology with Gradient Boosting Classifier, the AUC score improved by 10% and in Decision Tree Classifier by 27% compared to the model tested without the proposed feature selection method. Based on these results, we have concluded that student performance prediction depends on current academic record, past results, attendance, and socio–demographic factors.},

 abstract = {The chronic pilot shortage that has plagued the United States Air Force over the past three years poses a national-level problem that senior military members are working to overcome. Unfortunately, not all pilot candidates successfully complete the necessary training requirements to become fully qualified Air Force pilots, which wastes critical time and resources and only further exacerbates the pilot shortage problem. Therefore, it is important for the Air Force to carefully consider whom they select to attend pilot training. This research examines historical specialized undergraduate pilot training (SUPT) candidate data leveraging a variety of machine learning techniques to obtain insights on candidate success. Computational experimentation is performed to determine how selected machine learning techniques and their respective hyperparameters affect solution quality. Results reveal that the extremely randomized tree machine learning technique can achieve nearly 94% accuracy in predicting candidate success. Additional analysis indicates degree type and commissioning source are the most important features in determining candidate success. Ultimately, this research can inform the modification of future SUPT candidate selection criteria and other related Air Force personnel policies.},

Nevertheless, only a few studies have investigated the behavioral patterns of high-scoring (HS) and low-scoring (LS) students to facilitate predictions during peer assessment (PA). Therefore, we performed learning analytics to explore the behavioral patterns of HS and LS students in 52 university students from affective, cognitive, and metacognitive perspectives as these students engage in online PAs. The results indicated that on the affective dimension, HS students tended to exhibit negative affection while LS students tended to display positive affection. On the cognitive dimension, HS students demonstrated more intricate transformations compared to the LS students. Regarding the metacognitive dimension, LS students more likely reflected upon and accepted the reviews provided by others than the HS. Additionally, the findings also revealed that HS students were supported by focused social networks and overall stable activity engagement, whereas the LS students were less engaged at the beginning of the activity but had evolving social networks and were more engaged in the later stages of the activity. These findings offer valuable insights for educators in effectively predicting student performance based on behavioral patterns while providing new perspectives to support instructional decision-making processes.},

 abstract = {Abstract - Student performance prediction has a pivotal role in educational institutions, providing valuable insights into students' academic outcomes and aiding educators in implementing personalized interventions. In the previous works, many variants of ML and AI techniques have been implemented with high accuracy. However, the lack of transparency due to the heterogeneous nature of features that lead to biases, forced inequalities or even challenges in interpreting the model implications have not been addressed. An approach that harnesses the power of hybrid intelligence, combining human expertise with artificial intelligence (AI), to enhance transparency and accountability in the decision-making process of student performance prediction is required. Co-evolutionary Hybrid Intelligence (CHI) approach, will not only discover interdisciplinary facets including past exam scores, attendance records, demographic information, and socio-economic factors but also interpret the influence of every component i.e., teacher, student, and learning environment to predict student performance. Two modules are discussed in this paper. The first module classifies the teachers into two classes of expertise by comparing the accuracy performance of six well-known machine learning techniques namely Logistic Regression (LR), MultiLayer Perceptron(MLP), Naive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbor (kNN), and Random Forest (RF). Second, we propose a multiclass student performance prediction model (RLCHI) built upon a combination of reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms that will aid the model to perceive patterns and adjustments inherently and expert teachers' opinions(CHI) from the first model that will bring invaluably contextual understanding, nuanced judgment, and a deep knowledge of pedagogy to the equation. The performance of the RLCHI model is evaluated. The obtained results show that the proposed model scores better than models built only on the RL algorithm on the same dataset. The accuracy, precision, recall, and Fl score of the model achieved with hybrid intelligence is 79.5, 49.9, 52.3, 53.2 when compared to 71.9,48.30,46.6,46.1 achieved with only RL respectively.},

However, an early prediction before course commencement is still a research challenge. Such advanced forecast can help the teachers in providing timely assistance to uplift the academic performance of a student, reduce the number of failures and performance degradations. Importantly, an additional measure of prediction confidence can be useful in this regard to decide the magnitude of the assistance required. The primary objective of this study is to predict the failure, degradation and improvement before course commencement. A real dataset containing nearly 0.6 million records is used here for this purpose. We have initially applied multiple state-of-the-art classifiers on this dataset to predict the performance in binary terms. Unfortunately, these classifiers could not perform well, and they are unable to provide the desired prediction confidence as well. We have therefore proposed a novel scalable algorithm, named random wheel, for classification. It not only works efficiently on this dataset but also works well with other benchmarked datasets. The proposed classifier provides an additional measure to indicate the prediction confidence. It, in turn, increases the acceptability of the prediction.},

It analyses the effects using a social justice lens. Particular attention is paid to the experiences of individuals who have historically experienced disadvantage and discrimination. The article uses the university admissions process where the university utilises a fully automated decision-making process to evaluate the capability or suitability of the candidate as a case study. The article posits that the artificial intelligence decision-making process should be viewed as an institution that reconfigures the relationships between individuals, and between individuals and institutions. Artificial intelligence decision-making processes have institutional elements embedded within them that result in their operation disadvantaging groups who have historically experienced discrimination. Depending on the manner in which an artificial intelligence decision-making process is designed, it can produce solidarity or segregation between groups in society. There is a potential for the operation of artificial intelligence decision-making processes to fail to reflect the lived experiences of individuals and as a result to undermine the protection of human diversity. Some of these effects are linked to the creation of an ableist culture and to the resurrection of eugenics-type discourses. It is concluded that one of the contexts in which human beings should reach decisions is where the decision involves representing and evaluating the capabilities of an individual. The legislature should respond accordingly by identifying contexts in which it is mandatory to employ human decision-makers and by enacting the relevant legislation.},

 abstract = {Evaporation, as a core process within the global hydrological cycle, requires reliable methods to monitor its variation, for decision-making in agriculture, irrigation systems and dam operations, also in other areas of hydrology and water resource management. Accurate monitoring of pan evaporation (Ep) is one the most popular approaches to understand the evaporative process. This work aims to construct a hybrid Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) predictive model that is coupled with Neighbourhood Component Analysis for feature selection to predict Ep in drought-prone regions in Queensland, Australia (Amberley, Gatton, Oakey, & Townsville). Utilizing the daily-scale dataset [31 August 2002 to 22 September 2020], the performance of the proposed deep learning (DL) hybrid model, denoted as NCA-LSTM, is compared with competitive benchmark models, i.e., standalone LSTM, other types of DL, single hidden layer neuronal architecture and decision tree-based method. The testing results reveal the lowest Relative Root Mean Square Error ≤20%, Absolute Percentage Bias ≤14.5% and the highest Kling-Gupta Efficiency ≥87% attained by the NCA-LSTM hybrid model (relative to benchmark models) tested for Amberley, Gatton, and Oakey sites. In respect to the predictive efficiency, the proposed NCA-LSTM hybrid model, improved with feature selection, outperforms all benchmark models, indicating its future utility in the prediction of daily Ep. In practical sense, the predictive model developed for Ep estimation provides an accurate estimation of evaporative water loss in hydrological cycle and therefore, can be implemented in areas of irrigation management, planning of irrigation-based agriculture, and mitigation of financial losses to agricultural and related sectors where, regular monitoring and forecasting of water resources are a vital part of sustainable livelihood and business.},

 abstract = {Motion-Based Learning Technologies (MBLT) offer a promising approach for integrating play and problem-solving behaviour within children’s learning. The proliferation of sensor technology has driven the field of learning technology towards the development of tools and methods that may benefit from the produced Multi-Modal Data (MMD). Such data can be used to uncover cognitive, affective and physiological processes during learning activities. Combining MMD with more traditionally exercised assessment tools, such as video content analysis, provides a more holistic understanding of children’s learning experiences and has the potential to enable the design of educational technologies capable of harmonising children’s cognitive, affective and physiological processes, while promoting appropriately balanced play and problem-solving efforts. However, the use of an MMD mixed methods approach that combines qualitative and MMD data to understand children’s behaviours during engagement with MBLT is rather unexplored. We present an in-situ study where 26 children, ages 10–12, solved a motion-based sorting task for learning geometry. We continuously and unobtrusively monitored children’s learning experiences using MMD collection via eye-trackers, wristbands, Kinect joint tracking, and a web camera. We devised SP3, a novel observational scheme that can be used to understand children’s solo interactions with MBLT, and applied it to identify and extract children’s evoked play and problem-solving behaviour. Collective analysis of the MMD and video codes provided explanations of children’s task performance through consideration of their holistic learning experience. Lastly, we applied predictive modelling to identify the synergies between various MMD measurements and children’s play and problem-solving behaviours. This research sheds light on the opportunities offered in the confluence of video coding (a traditional method in learning sciences) and MMD (an emerging method that leverages sensors proliferation) for investigating children’s behaviour with MBLT.},

This paper conducted a topic modeling analysis of articles related to educational data mining and learning analytics to reveal thematic features of the two fields. Specifically, we employed structural topic modeling to identify the topics of the two fields from the abstracts. We apply structural topic modeling on N=192 articles for educational data mining and N=489 articles for learning analytics. We infer five-topic models for both educational data mining and learning analytics. We find that while there appears to be disciplinary differences in terms of research focus, there is little support for a clear distinction between the two disciplines, beyond their different lineage. The trend points to a convergence within the field of educational research on the applications of advanced statistical learning techniques to extract actionable insights from large data streams for optimizing teaching and learning.

The half-quadratic (HQ) technique is employed to optimize the penalty weights for each training sample, aiming to weaken the impacts caused by the noisy data or outliers throughout the training session. Alternating optimization (AO) methodology is used to renew the RSCN model in company with updated penalty weights determined by HQ methods. The performance of RSC-MCC algorithm is compared with some existing methods, such as the probabilistic robust learning algorithm for neural networks with random weights (PRNNRW), RVFL networks, improved RVFL networks (Imp-RVFL), and our recent work RSCNs with kernel density estimation (RSC-KDE), on two synthetic function approximation examples, four benchmark datasets and one educational data modelling case study (for student learning performance prediction).

Recent efforts have used clickstream data to create timely, fine-grained, and comprehensive measures of self-regulated learning (SRL) in online courses in an attempt to shed light on the process of SRL and to improve the identification of students who lack SRL skills and are at risk of low achievement. However, key questions remain: to what extent do these clickstream measures correspond to traditional self-reported measures about specific SRL constructs? Do these clickstream measures provide more information than existing self-reported measures in predicting course performance? This study used the clickstream data collected from a learning management system to measure two aspects of SRL: time management and effort regulation. We found that the clickstream measures were significantly associated with students' self-reported time management and effort regulation after the course. In addition, these clickstream measures significantly improved predictions of students' performance in the current and subsequent courses over predictions based on self-reported measures alone. These results provide evidence for the validity of the clickstream measures and guide the use of clickstream data to understand the process of SRL and identify students who might not be well served by taking classes online.},

Recently, researchers have proposed a series of effective machine learning (ML) based classification strategies to predict students’ academic performance. However, prior arts are typically concerned about individual models but neglect the association among students, which might considerably have an effect on the integrity of the academic performance-related representations. Meanwhile, students’ multi-viewing behavior contains complex relations among students. Therefore, we propose a Multi-View Hypergraph Neural Network (MVHGNN) for predicting students’ academic performance. MVHGNN uses hypergraphs to construct high-order relations among students. The semantic information implied by multiple behaviors is consolidated through meta-paths. Further, a Cascade Attention Transformer (CAT) module is introduced to mine the weight of different behaviors by the self-attention mechanism. Our method is evaluated on real campus student behavioral datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art ones.},

Big data technology enables the capture and analysis of massive amounts of data generated during the teaching process, providing the possibility for a deeper understanding of teaching activities. However, how to extract useful information from these vast amounts of data and transform it into strategies for teaching improvement is a challenge. The research aims to propose a teaching quality monitoring and improvement method based on big data technology, which combines K-means clustering algorithm and association rule mining algorithm to improve the accuracy of teaching monitoring and the effectiveness of teaching improvement. In order to cope with these challenges, the study proposes a research method of big data technology based on joint K-mean clustering algorithm and association rule mining algorithm. The study first analyzes the teaching quality monitoring and evaluation indexes using the K-mean algorithm. Then the association rule mining algorithm is utilized to mine the data in the teaching quality monitoring indicators with association rules on the basis of the obtained cluster analysis. Finally, on the basis of association rule mining, the study constructs the assessment model of teaching quality monitoring indicators by utilizing the fused method. The outcomes revealed that the average of data analysis accuracy and the average of recall rate of the modeling method were 93.79 % and 91.95 %, respectively. Meanwhile, the evaluation time of the modeling method in the process of teaching quality monitoring data processing was 17.3 s, and the evaluation precision was 93.15 % respectively. Additionally, the process's overall confidence and enhancement are 95.01 % and 86.73 %, respectively, and the modeling method's performance is compared to other approaches. This shown that the approach may significantly boost the precision and effectiveness of monitoring the quality of instruction, as well as offer strong backing for the enhancement of instruction in higher education institutions.},

The Advanced demonstrated the highest SkippingBackward frequency with a small SkippingBackward time ratio, revealing confidence in searching the desired clips. In contrast, the Indifferent exhibited the least frequency but the largest time ratio for SkippingBackward, implying distraction problems. In addition, this study showed that the Pause time ratio was indirectly related to weekly quiz scores via autonomous motivation with marginal significance. Based on these results, we demonstrate that learning motivation can be revealed from dynamic clickstreams in video-based learning (i.e., the interaction between students and learning contexts), supporting its dynamic developmental mechanism. The authors suggest that instructors offer on-demand instructional materials and implement top-down video-viewing strategies or digital prompts to support and encourage autonomy in video-based learning.},

 abstract = {To construct dialogue-based Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) with sufficient pedagogical expertise, a trendy research method is to mine large-scale data collected by existing dialogue-based ITS or generated between human tutors and students to discover effective tutoring strategies. However, most of the existing research has mainly focused on the analysis of successful tutorial dialogue. We argue that, to better inform the design of dialogue-based ITS, it is also important to analyse unsuccessful tutorial dialogues and gain a better understanding of the reasons behind those failures. Therefore, our study aimed to identify effective tutoring strategies by mining a large-scale dataset of both successful and unsuccessful human–human online tutorial dialogues, and further used these tutoring strategies for predicting students’ problem-solving performance. Specifically, the study adopted a widely-used educational dialogue act scheme to describe the action behind utterances made by a tutor/student in the broader context of a tutorial dialogue (e.g., asking/answering a question, providing hints). Frequent dialogue acts were identified and analysed by taking into account the prior progress that a student had made before the start of a tutorial session and the problem-solving performance the student achieved after the end of the session. Besides, we performed a sequence analysis on the inferred actions to identify prominent patterns that were closely related to students’ problem-solving performance. These prominent patterns could shed light on the frequent strategies used by tutors. Lastly, we measured the power of these tutorial actions in predicting students’ problem-solving performance by applying a well-established machine learning method, Gradient Tree Boosting (GTB). Through extensive analysis and evaluations, we identified a set of different action patterns that were pertinent to tutors and students across dialogues of different traits, e.g., students without prior progress in solving problems, compared to those with prior progress, were likely to receive more thought-provoking questions from their tutors. More importantly, we demonstrated that the actions taken by students and tutors during a tutorial process could not adequately predict student performance and should be considered together with other relevant factors (e.g., the informativeness of the utterances).},

 abstract = {In recent years, the field of learning analytics has gained significant attention as educators and researchers seek to understand and optimize the learning process in online learning systems. This paper presents a novel methodology for predicting learning performance in online learning systems by leveraging natural language processing (NLP) and embedding techniques. The study focuses on two online learning systems, namely BookRoll and Viscode, and aims to analyze the learning behaviors of students using system logs extracted from the databases. The logs are converted into semester and daily learning description documents to capture the daily activities and progress of the learners. To transform the natural language data into numerical representations, the transformer-based BERT model, Google Gemini, and OpenAI large text embedding methodology are employed to generate embeddings for the learning descriptions. Subsequently, k-means clustering is applied to identify distinct learning behaviors exhibited by students. These clusters are labeled with numbers, and the daily learning descriptions are combined into a sequence, referred to as the DNA of learning behaviors. By utilizing this DNA representation, the learning status of students is effectively captured, and a machine learning model is trained to predict learning performance. The experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methodology in achieving highly convincing predictions. The contributions of this research lie in the adoption of a unique approach, integrating NLP methodologies and embeddings techniques, to enable accurate learning performance prediction in online learning systems.},

In a computer-aided 3D design context, this study used cluster analysis to identify SDL behavioral patterns based on the trace data of 193 middle school students and further examined the differences in the perceived SDL ability and creative performance. Four distinct SDL behavioral patterns were identified: fully engaged, planning and reflection engaged, execution and regulation engaged, and minimally engaged learners. There were significant differences in the perceived SDL ability and creative performance between the four SDL behavioral patterns. The fully engaged learners showed the highest levels of perceived SDL ability and creative performance; the minimally engaged learners showed the lowest levels of perceived SDL ability and creative performance; the planning and reflection engaged learners had higher levels of perceived SDL ability and creative performance than the execution and regulation engaged learners. The findings provide insights for better understanding SDL from a behavioral perspective and for effective incorporation of SDL in a design context.},

 abstract = {In the Massive Online Open Course (MOOC) forum, learning engagement encompasses three fundamental dimensions—cognitive, emotional, and behavioral engagement—that intricately interact to jointly influence students' learning achievements. However, the interplay between multiple engagement dimensions and their correlations with learning achievement remain understudied, particularly across different academic disciplines. This study adopts an automated configurational approach that integrates bidirectional encoder representation from transformers (BERT) and fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to explore the configurations of learning engagement, their connections with learning achievement, and variations across disciplines. Our analysis reveals a nuanced profile of learners' learning engagement, indicating the high-achieving individuals demonstrated more frequent posting and commenting behaviors and the high-level cognitive engagement than low-achieving individuals. Second, our analysis revealed multiple configurations where the coexistence or absence of factors at different levels of the cognitive, behavioral, and emotional dimensions significantly impacted learning achievement. Learners who conducted posting and replying behaviors, expressed positive emotions, and engaged in deep cognitive engagement tended to achieve superior learning outcomes. Third, there were significant differences in behavioral and emotional engagement among learners across different academic disciplines. Specifically, pure discipline learners were more inclined to engage in posting behaviors than the applied discipline learners. Across academic disciplines, positive emotions correlated strongly with higher achievement. These findings deepen our understanding of the multifaceted characteristics of learning engagement in MOOCs and highlight the importance of disciplinary distinctions, providing a foundation for educators and designers to optimize learners’ MOOC effects and tailor learning experiences in diverse disciplinary contexts.},

However, it is a quite challenging task. On the one hand, each student has very limited historical course grades. On the other hand, a student may exhibit very different performance on different types of courses. As a result, most existing grade prediction methods don’t address such challenges and cannot achieve good results. Through empirical data analysis, we find that a group of students achieve similar grades over a set of similar courses. Based on the observations, we first construct student-course graphs, student-student graphs and course-course graphs to capture student-course dependency, student similarity and course similarity, respectively. Then, we propose a model named DGTEAM to specifically deal with these three dynamic graphs to obtain the representations of students and courses. The obtained representations of each course and student are applied to predict the grades. We conduct experiments on a real-world dataset and the result verifies the superiority of our model.},

@article{M2023120604,
 abstract = {Background and aim:
In recent days, the research on student’s intelligence level modelling is a challenging Artificial Intelligence (AI) task, which gains more attraction because it provides actionable insights to the tutor by analysing the intelligence level of the learners. Each learner’s knowledge, comprehension, and intellectual capacities are unique. It is critical to identify these capacities and provide learners, particularly slow learners, with the necessary knowledge. Cognitive Performance Test (CPT) is an essential component for assessing the knowledge level of students. The reasoning level or coefficient deals with the analysis of the thinking capability in a logical way. It also reflects the child’s learning potential. The main aim of the proposed system is to design a Cognitive Knowledge Representation Model (CKRM), which fuses Cognitive Performance Metrics (CPM) calculation and Reasoning Coefficient Calculation (RCC) algorithms to assess the student’s intelligence level. The result of the proposed system is stratification of students to three different ranges of reasoning coefficient.
Methods:
The CKRM consists of the following phases: data collection, statistical Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), model building and analysis, which involve the assessment of the knowledge level using CPT and calculation of reasoning coefficient using First Order Logic (FOL), and finally model evaluation using cognitive evaluation metrics. CPM and RCC algorithms have been proposed in this paper to calculate the student’s reasoning coefficient by using the forward chaining FOL inference engine. The dataset is a real time data which consists of the academic and cognitive performance details of school students from classes 1 to 6 for the year 2019 to 2020. The academic data are collected from the Educational Management Information System (EMIS) maintained by the school. The cognitive performance data are collected by conducting the tests for the students using the memory training application called Lumosity.
Results:
The proposed system’s performance is evaluated using ten Machine Learning (ML) algorithms in which the Quadratic Discriminant Analysis achieved an accuracy of 0.97 for classes 1, 2, and 3. For classes 4, 5, and 6, nearly twelve ML algorithms are evaluated in which Random Forest (RF) Classifier achieved an accuracy of 0.98. Six math expert committee teachers concluded that the reasoning coefficient value was acceptable with an average accuracy of 0.92 for classes 1, 2, 3 and 0.9 for classes 4, 5, 6. In comparison to the pre-existing models employed in the prior research, it was determined that the created CKRM (academic and cognitive) was superior. The cognitive metrics such as taskability, Response Time (RT), knowledge capacity and utilization has also been evaluated. The average values of taskability, RT, knowledge capacity and knowledge utilization are 0.85, 0.81, 0.55, and 0.44.
Conclusion:
The ultimate goal is to make customized teaching easier; hence, this article involves determining a student’s cognitive level by estimating their reasoning coefficient. The suggested approach analyses and categorizes students’ cognitive abilities, such as memory, reasoning, problem solving, thinking, and logical reasoning, using three different reasoning coefficients. This approach assists teachers in determining the degree of intelligence of their students.},

Dubbed as Personas-based Student Grouping (PSG), our method first applies unsupervised clustering techniques to assign personas to students based on their behavioral characteristics. Based on their personas, we then utilize deep reinforcement learning to search for appropriate grouping rules and perform linear programming to obtain a suitable grouping scheme. Finally, the teaching effectiveness is fed back as the rewards to the reinforcement learning model to optimize future grouping scheme selections. Extensive experiments conducted on MOOCs datasets show that PSG can achieve more advantageous performance in both efficiency and effectiveness compared to the manual or random grouping mechanism. We hope PSG can provide students with a more enhanced learning experience and contribute to the future development of education. Our project homepage is available at https://PSG-project.pages.dev.},

This paper presents a Decision Support System (DSS) that leverages a hybrid data mining model to analyze educational data and unveil concealed patterns and rules. The DSS aims to support decision-makers in enhancing the operational effectiveness of academic institutions by enabling accurate determination of student eligibility for specific courses.

The research outcomes highlight the considerable potential of the hybrid model in facilitating informed scholarship decisions and fostering overall institutional efficiency. Furthermore, the proposed DSS could be deployed with various educational datasets, potentially empowering decision-makers with valuable insights to distinguish between successful and unsuccessful students early in the course.

 abstract = {The concept of Artificial Intelligence (AI), born as the possibility of simulating the human brain's learning capabilities, quickly evolves into one of the educational technology concepts that provide tools for students to better themselves in a plethora of areas. Unlike the previous educational technology iterations, which are limited to instrumental use for providing platforms to build learning applications, AI has proposed a unique education laboratory by enabling students to explore an instrument that functions as a dynamic system of computational concepts. However, the extent of the implications of AI adaptation in modern education is yet to be explored. Motivated to fill the literature gap and to consider the emerging significance of AI in education, this paper aims to analyze the possible intertwined relationship between students’ intrinsic motivation for learning Artificial Intelligence during the COVID-19 pandemic; the relationship between students’ computational thinking and understanding of AI concepts; and the underlying dynamic relation, if existing, between AI and computational thinking building efforts. To investigate the mentioned relationships, the present empirical study employs mediation analysis based upon collected 137 survey data from Universidad Politécnica de Madrid students in the Institute for Educational Science and the School of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering during the first quarter of 2022. Findings show that intrinsic motivation mediates the relationship between perceived Artificial Intelligence learning and computational thinking. Also, the research indicates that intrinsic motivation has a significant relationship with computational thinking and perceived Artificial Intelligence learning.},

 abstract = {Introduction
Since the advent of medical education systems, managing high-stakes exams has been a top priority and challenge for all policymakers. However, considering machine learning (ML) techniques as a replacement for medical licensing examinations, particularly during crises such as the COVID-19 outbreak, could be an effective solution. This study uses ML models to develop a framework for predicting medical students' performance on high-stakes exams, such as the Comprehensive Medical Basic Sciences Examination (CMBSE).
Material and methods
Prediction of students' status and score on high-stakes examinations faces several challenges, including an imbalanced number of failing and passing students, a large number of heterogeneous and complex features, and the need to identify at-risk and top-performing students. In this study, two major categories of ML approaches are compared: first, classic models (logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), and k-nearest neighbors (KNN)), and second, ensemble models (voting, bagging (BG), random forests (RF), adaptive boosting (ADA), extreme gradient boosting (XGB), and stacking).
Results
To evaluate the models' discrimination ability, they are assessed using a real dataset containing information on medical students over a five-year period (n = 1005). The findings indicate that ensemble ML models demonstrate optimal performance in predicting CMBSE status (RF and stacking). Similarly, among the classic regressors, LR exhibited the highest root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) (0.134) and coefficient of determination (R2) (0.62), whereas the RF model had the highest RMSD (0.077) and R2 (0.80) overall. Furthermore, Anatomical Sciences, Biochemistry, Parasitology, and Entomology grade point average (GPA) and grades demonstrated the strongest positive correlation with the outcomes.
Conclusion
Comparing classic and ensemble ML models revealed that ensemble models are superior to classic models. Therefore, the presented framework could be considered a suitable alternative for the CMBSE and other comparable medical licensing examinations.},

 abstract = {Relational Association Rules (RARs) capture generic relations between attributes values in possibly large data sets. Due to their ability to uncover underlying semantically relevant patterns, they are of particular interest in data mining research and applicable in both unsupervised and supervised learning scenarios. With the aim of increasing the stability and expressiveness of the classical, non-gradual RARs, Gradual Relational Association Rules (GRARs) have been introduced. By generalizing the boolean relations to gradual relations, GRARs also capture the degrees to which generic relations are satisfied. In the current paper we introduce a new approach called DynGRAR (Dynamic Gradual Relational Association Rules Miner) for uncovering interesting GRARs in dynamic data sets which are incrementally extended with both new data instances and new data attributes. DynGRAR dynamically adjusts the set of all interesting GRARs. Through multiple experiments performed on publicly available software defect prediction data sets, we have evaluated DynGRAR versus applying the standard GRARs mining algorithm from scratch on the extended data. The results obtained emphasize the superior performance of the dynamic approach we propose.},

 abstract = {The application of energy-efficient strategies in buildings, such as the Green Building Concept, can significantly impact human comfort and resource consumption. However, due to the complexity of decision-making factors and the variety of available materials, computational models are necessary to identify the most effective solutions and optimise building energy performance. This study presents an integrated framework that uses machine learning algorithms and a Petri Net control system to optimise the thermal, comfort, and energy efficiency of both vertical and horizontal building envelopes in semi-arid climate zones. The framework incorporates several passive techniques for building energy parameters, including material thickness and melting point, window types, wall insulation thickness and thermal emissivity, wall solar absorbance, window wall ratio, fenestration position, air tightness, roof solar reflectance, roof insulation thickness and conductivity (W/(m·°C)), and floor insulation thickness. An experiment design was developed using Box-Behnken Design-Response Surface Methodology (BBD-RSM) for statistical optimisation, which was coupled with Design Builder simulation model. The methodology was demonstrated by applying it to a residential building in Mexico. Meta Additive Regression was used to analyse the output factors, which showed higher confidence compared to REP Tree and M5P Tree algorithms in green buildings. The results demonstrate that an annual energy reduction of 50 kW/m2 per household can be achieved by using an optimised building envelope.},

This assumption, while ideologically sound, is questionable in practise because the authenticity and accessibility of data cannot be guaranteed in many circumstances. Inaccurate, incomplete, inconsistent, and inaccessible data are common in supply chains and prevent the QMS from achieving its goal: assuring product and process quality to meet customer requirements. This study is one of the first to examine the impact of data quality and data latency on process control and quality analysis which are elemental parts of daily QMS activities, from a supply chain visibility (SCV) perspective. In this study, five propositions are made to show the relationships between technology, SCV, and data issues. More importantly, the study proposes a platform that integrates Blockchain (BC) technology, Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), and Big Data to solve data problems in SCV and QMS. We further perform fuzzy association rule mining (FARM) to show how the platform can solve quality analysis problems and complete a closed-loop process control cycle in manufacturing. We also explain the contributions of the integrated platform to QMS from four theoretical perspectives. Finally, we discuss the limitations of the platform and provide recommendations for future research.},

 abstract = {This research suggests two novel metaheuristic algorithms to enhance student performance: Harris Hawk's Optimizer (HHO) and the Earthworm Optimization Algorithm (EWA). In this sense, a series of adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) proposed models were trained using these methods. The selection of the best-fit model depends on finding an excellent connection between inputs and output(s) layers in training and testing datasets (e.g., a combination of expert knowledge, experimentation, and validation techniques). The study's primary result is a division of the participants into two performance-based groups (failed and non-failed). The experimental data used to build the models measured fourteen process variables: relocation, gender, age at enrollment, debtor, nationality, educational special needs, current tuition fees, scholarship holder, unemployment, inflation, GDP, application order, day/evening attendance, and admission grade. During the model evaluation, a scoring system was created in addition to using mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), and area under the curve (AUC) to assess the efficacy of the utilized approaches. Further research revealed that the HHO-ANFIS is superior to the EWA-ANFIS. With AUC = 0.8004 and 0.7886, MSE of 0.62689 and 0.65598, and MAE of 0.64105 and 0.65746, the failure of the pupils was assessed with the most significant degree of accuracy. The MSE, MAE, and AUC precision indicators showed that the EWA-ANFIS is less accurate, having MSE amounts of 0.71543 and 0.71776, MAE amounts of 0.70819 and 0.71518, and AUC amounts of 0.7565 and 0.758. It was found that the optimization algorithms have a high ability to increase the accuracy and performance of the conventional ANFIS model in predicting students' performance, which can cause changes in the management of the educational system and improve the quality of academic programs.},

With the current development of science and technology, big data is emphasized as the most significant technology in data analysis. From the recorded educational data, efficient prediction of students' dropout is currently a hot topic of research. Previous studies have focused only on the students' dropout based on specific levels such as individual, middle school, and university level. However, ensemble learning approaches have not received much research attention so far to predict students' dropout in university classes based on rare datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel stacking ensemble based on a hybrid of Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Gradient Boosting (GB), and Feed-forward Neural Networks (FNN) to predict student's dropout in university classes. On the dataset collected from 2016 to 2020 at Constantine the Philosopher University in Nitra, the proposed method has demonstrated greater performance when compared with the base models using testing accuracy and the area under the curve (AUC) evaluation metrics under the same conditions. Based on the findings of this study, students at the risk of dropping out the school can be identified based on influential factors and different agents of education can refer to this information for early intervention in the uncontrolled behavior that can lead to the risk of dropping out and take proactive precautionary measures before the issue arise.},

Factorization machines offer a combination of the advantages of support vector machines and factorization models such as matrix factorization. The results of conventional methods, which predict student performance using factorization machines, exhibited better results than they have before.

 abstract = {Student Performance Prediction (SPP) has received a lot of attention due to its educational implications, such as personalized instruction. Among numerous attempts in SPP, recommendation-based approaches (e.g. matrix factorization; MF) are especially attractive because of the specialized nature of personalization. However, they commonly struggle with the cold-start problem and incorporating side information. While existing works cope with the problem by utilizing additional information, such as students’ personalities, none of them cover the multimodal auxiliary information that can unleash the full potential of the recommendation-based SPP. In this work, we leverage multimodal auxiliary information at SPP for the first time by adopting large language models (GPT-J and Llama 2) as information blenders to produce extra guidance signals for the MF method. Specifically, our language model-guided matrix factorization (LMgMF), consumes the verbalized multimodal information, produces semantically rich embeddings for educational interaction, and uses them as auxiliary signals for MF. While doing so, we harness a API-level black-box language model without requiring parameter accessibility to adapt them. We evaluate LMgMF on two real-world datasets: (1) a large-scale Korean dataset that contains 1.6M instances from 10K pre-high school students; (2) ASSISTments2009 covering 346K interactions between students and math questions. Throughout extensive validation, we demonstrate that LMgMF consistently outperforms baseline methods in various SPP scenarios, including the cold-start.},

To fill the gap, this systematic review provides an overview of the goals, characteristics, and effects of existing AI-driven learning analytics applications and tools in CSCL. According to the screening criteria, out of the 2607 initially identified articles between 2004 and 2023, 26 articles are included for final synthesis. Our results show that existing tools primarily focus on students’ cognitive engagement. Existing tools primarily utilize communicative discourse, behavioral, and evaluation data to present results and visualizations.

Moreover, although AI techniques have been applied for presenting statistical information, there is a lack of providing alert or suggestive information in existing tools or applications.

 abstract = {Machine learning is an integral part of artificial intelligence. Machine learning is capable of classifying the existing data and can predict and forecast results. The evaluation of student performance in educational institutions reveals the degree of effort that educational institutions should do in order to improve the poor or average learner. The importance of using EDM models is that they leverage prior data from students to forecast unanticipated or impending student performance. Though the educational sector employs a variety of techniques to extract meaningful information about the characteristics of students who participate in the learning process, a student performance assessment model is required to assist students and faculty in moving their performance to the next level. This paper describes a machine learning based framework for forecasting student performance. Model makes use of three machine learning algorithms namely- Support vector Machine, Random Forest and Regression Analysis. The experimental findings have demonstrated that the performance of SVM is concerned with the student's performance.},

 abstract = {Post-pandemic student performance prediction has gained considerable attention within the academic community. Educational institutions worldwide have adopted blended learning approaches for delivering education and assessments. In this study, we harnessed data from the ‘Offee’ assessment platform based in Mumbai, India, spanning from September 2020 to October 2022. This dataset allows us to analyze the real impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on examinations. To tackle the challenges posed by high-dimensional data, we employed feature selection techniques to retain only the most significant features for predicting student performance. Specifically, we assessed the effectiveness of two decision tree-based methods, J48 classifier and Random Forest, in conjunction with the ranker search method using wrapper subset evaluation. The resulting feature set was then utilized to train and test a Support Vector Machine model for predicting student performance. Our findings reveal that both J48 and Random Forest feature selection methods yield impressive precision accuracy rates for student performance prediction, achieving 93.14% and 86.24%, respectively. In contrast, using the dataset without feature selection resulted in lower precision accuracy, standing at 79.9%, and consumed more time during model training and development. In summary, this study underscores the significance of feature selection in enhancing the accuracy of student performance prediction compared to utilizing the dataset without such feature curation.},

 abstract = {Many research studies confirmed that the application of machine learning methods for predicting students at risk of academic failure can be beneficial for improving student performance in higher education institutions. Simultaneously, these studies emphasised the importance of the input data quality, its precise pre-processing and thoroughly selected features on final performance metrics of the applied classification algorithms. However, the stand-alone application of well-known classification algorithms still has performance limitations, which can be outperformed using ensembles of classifiers. Therefore, this paper aims to evaluate the overall contribution of the selected ensemble methods to the early prediction of students at risk of dropping out of learning courses. All phases of CRISP-DM methodology are described in this study to explain the complexity of the problem of the practical adoption of voting-based heterogeneous ensemble methods in the case of data obtained from the course of the university learning management system compared to traditional classification algorithms enhanced by ensemble learning with AdaBoost and XGBoost methods. As a result, the study confirmed that the features which characterise the students’ performance and their interactions in the course can be considered the most significant for the identification of the students at risk of dropping out. Moreover, in the case of advanced ensemble algorithms, the overall accuracy, recall, precision, and f1 score were improved by 2-4%. The proposed method has demonstrated exceptional performance. Finally, the paper summarises the findings and their implications for effective prediction.},

Using data from 32 Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development countries from the latest cycle of the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) 2018 reading dataset, this study combines an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm and hierarchical linear modeling (HLM) to examine the effects of student-level and school-level ICT-related factors in the blended learning setting on students' reading performance. Results show that students' perceived autonomy and competence in ICT, preference for different reading formats, quality of school ICT resources and school ICT use policies are positively related to reading performance, whereas school ICT use support for teachers and the teaching of ICT skills are negatively related to students' reading scores. The quadratic effects of students' interests in ICT, family and school ICT resources, and ICT uses are identified, showing an inverted U-shaped trend. The possible linear and quadratic moderation effects of school-level ICT-related features are also investigated. This study invites consideration of a combination of analytical methods for a comprehensive exploration of reading education and sheds light on how the delicate association of multilevel ICT factors in blended learning settings can contribute to the improvement of reading education. Instructors in blended learning settings should effectively integrate technology and appropriately apply pedagogies, and the design of blended learning should be sustainable and learner-friendly to exploit students’ learning potential.},

 abstract = {The ability to predict students' performance is important not only for the students but also for academic stakeholders in higher education institutes. Predictions can be made by using data stored in an academic information system on students' behavior related to taking courses that are an important part of a higher education institute with a coherent vertical curriculum. A student's course-taking behavior can be used as an indicator of their potential performance by investigating the alignment of their course-taking activities with curriculum guidelines. Domain knowledge is also considered as a variable due to the varying compositions of courses in curriculum guidelines. Past performance also needs to be taken into consideration. The result of the prediction can be used to help academic stakeholders take actions such as intervening to ensuring that students graduate on time. In this paper, we propose a two-layer ensemble learning technique that combines ensemble learning and ensemble-based progressive prediction and it utilizes students' learning behavior data and domain knowledge for current and past performances. The results show that the accuracy of our proposed framework on a real-world student dataset is improved.},

This work reports on an investigation into these questions, which we answer through analyses exploring metrics, machine learning classifiers, and recommendations. We report on several findings: the degree of expertise correlates to behavioral patterns, whereby experts would rarely ask for help, and instead, predominantly provide help to other community members; the inclusion of an expert results in longer discussions. We propose a metric (the weighted sum), which enables us to better quantify the reputations of expert members of the community. We describe the use of four machine learning classifiers for the identification of both expert users and the most significant conversations within these communities. We propose a novel approach for a recommendation system, which utilizes semantic annotations to identify topical experts and to ascertain their respective area of specialism. We foresee the suitability of our expertise-finding methods and findings to support Learning Analytics, and in scenarios where users may apply lessons learnt from our results to improve their status in a community.

The foremost and most prime sector among those affected were schools, colleges, and universities. The education system of entire nations had shifted to online education during this time. Many shortcomings of Learning Management Systems (LMSs) were detected to support education in an online mode that spawned the research in Artificial Intelligence (AI) based tools that are being developed by the research community to improve the effectiveness of LMSs. This paper presents a detailed survey of the different enhancements to LMSs, which are led by key advances in the area of AI to enhance the real-time and non-real-time user experience. The AI-based enhancements proposed to the LMSs start from the Application layer and Presentation layer in the form of flipped classroom models for the efficient learning environment and appropriately designed UI/UX for efficient utilization of LMS utilities and resources, including AI-based chatbots. Session layer enhancements are also required, such as AI-based online proctoring and user authentication using Biometrics. These extend to the Transport layer to support real-time and rate adaptive encrypted video transmission for user security/privacy and satisfactory working of AI-algorithms. It also needs the support of the Networking layer for IP-based geolocation features, the Virtual Private Network (VPN) feature, and the support of Software-Defined Networks (SDN) for optimum Quality of Service (QoS). Finally, in addition to these, non-real-time user experience is enhanced by other AI-based enhancements such as Plagiarism detection algorithms and Data Analytics.},

Recent research integrates features of learning activities into knowledge tracing to enhance interpretability. Ausubel’s cognitive theory underscores the significance of cognitive accumulation in learning, perceiving it as a process in which new content is linked and integrated with students’ existing knowledge. Yet, current studies often overlook this cognitive property and its impact on performance prediction. Therefore, we propose an attention-based knowledge tracing model, named Student State-aware knowledge tracing (SSKT). To align with this cognitive process, we incorporate suitable Query, Key, and Value objects into the attention mechanism, effectively modeling how students extract, integrate, and apply information from their existing knowledge. Meanwhile, traditional RNN-based models encounter the issue of losing early learning data due to gradient vanishing in long sequences. Our hybrid model, which combines LSTM and Transformer, efficiently extracts early learning information using an attention mechanism. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets validate the effectiveness and interpretability of SSKT.},

This research study will help the learners learn complex concepts quickly with different activities like flipped classrooms, online quizzes, learning by doing, and a virtual laboratory. This research is carried out to address the difficulties of learners and cover all the domains of learning, including knowledge, Skill, and Attitude. The fuzzy logic method has recently been applied in education to overcome these restrictions. While employing the fuzzy logic approach to evaluate student achievement, qualifications are assessed qualitatively rather than quantitatively. This research study applies Fuzzy Logic in the first stage, Factor Analysis (FA), and Machine Learning (ML) techniques in the second stage to discover essential factors associated with the effective use of Active Learning Strategies (ALS) in the Learning Management System (LMS) of information technology course learners. Fuzzy logic and neural network topology can be coupled using ANFIS, an adaptable network. FA is performed to find the critical factors for successful learners. The study compares the performance of five supervised machine learning algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbor, Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, Discriminant Analysis, and Support Vector Machine. These classifiers are evaluated to determine their suitability and model fit in the context of the research. In this study, real-time data is collected from B.Tech Information Technology learners. The following prediction models achieved high accuracy before FA analysis: Naive Bayes (90 %), Support Vector Machine (89 %), Discriminant Analysis (88 %), Decision Tree (86 %), and K-Nearest Neighbors (82 %). Naive Bayes gives the best accuracy, with 90 %. Following factor analysis (FA), the accuracy achieved by various classifiers is as follows: Naive Bayes - 92 %, K-Nearest Neighbors - 92 %, Support Vector Machine - 90 %, Discriminant Analysis - 89 %, and Decision Tree - 88 %. Among these, Naive Bayes and K-Nearest Neighbors exhibit the highest accuracy of 92 %.},

 abstract = {An affective state of a learner in E-learning has gained enormous interest. The prediction of the emotional state of a learner can enhance the outcome of learning by including designated mediation. Many techniques are developed for anticipating emotional states using video, audio, and bio-sensors. Still, examining video, and audio will not confirm secretiveness and is exposed to security issues. Here the creator devises a fusion technique, to be specific Squirrel Search and Rider optimization-grounded Deep LSTM for affect prediction. The Deep LSTM is trained to exercise the new fusion SS-ROA. Then, the SS-ROA-grounded Deep LSTM classifies the states like frustration, confusion, engagement, wrathfulness, and so on. It is based on the interaction log data of the E-learner. In conclusion, the course and student ID, predicted state, test marks, and course completion status are taken as result information to find out the correlations. The new algorithm gives the best performance in comparison to other present methods with the highest prediction accurateness of 0.962 and the most noteworthy connection of 0.379 respectively. After discovering affective states, students may get the advantage of getting real comments from a teacher for improving one's performance during learning. However, such systems should also give feedback about the learner's affective state or passion because it greatly affects the student's encouragement toward better learning.},

 abstract = {Designing and deployment of state-of-the-art electric vehicles (EVs) in terms of low cost and high driving range with appropriate reliability and security are identified as the key towards decarbonization of the transportation sector. Nevertheless, the utilization of lithium-ion batteries face a core difficulty associated with environmental degradation factors, capacity fade, aging-induced degradation, and end-of-life repurposing. These factors play a pivotal role in the field of EVs. In this regard, state-of-health (SOH) and remaining useful life (RUL) estimation outlines the efficacy of the batteries as well as facilitate in the development and testing of numerous EV optimizations with identification of parameters that will enhance and further improve their efficiency. Both indices give an accurate estimation of the battery performance, maintenance, prognostics, and health management. Accordingly, machine learning (ML) techniques provide a significant developmental scope as best parameters and approaches cannot be identified for these estimations. ML strategies comparatively provide a non-invasive approach with low computation and high accuracy considering the scalability and timescale issues of battery degradation. This paper objectively provides an inclusively extensive review on these topics based on the research conducted over the past decade. An in-depth introductory is provided for SOH and RUL estimation highlighting their process and significance. Furthermore, numerous ML techniques are thoroughly and independently investigated based on each category and sub-category implemented for SOH and RUL measurement. Finally, applications-oriented discussion that explicates the advantages in terms of accuracy and computation is presented that targets to provide an insight for further development in this field of research.},

 abstract = {In situations like the coronavirus pandemic, colleges and universities are forced to limit their offline and regular academic activities. Extended postponement of high-stakes exams due to health risk hereby reduces productivity and progress in later years. Several countries decided to organize the exams online. Since many other countries with large education boards had an inadequate infrastructure and insufficient resources during the emergency, education policy experts considered a solution to simultaneously protect public health and fully resume high-stakes exams -by canceling offline exam and introducing a uniform assessment process to be followed across the states and education boards. This research proposes a novel system using an AI model to accomplish the complex task of evaluating all students across education boards with maximum level of fairness and analyzes the ability to fairly appraise exam grades in the context of high-stakes examinations during SARS-CoV-2 emergency. Basically, a logistic regression classifier on top of a deep neural network is used to output predictions that are as fair as possible for all learners. The predictions of the proposed grade-awarding system are explained by the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) framework. SHAP allowed to identify the features of the students' portfolios that contributed most to the predicted grades. In the setting of an empirical analysis in one of the largest education systems in the Global South, 81.85% of learners were assigned fair scores while 3.12% of the scores were significantly smaller than the actual grades, which would have had a detrimental effect if it had been applied for real. Furthermore, SHAP allows policy-makers to debug the predictive model by identifying and measuring the importance of the factors involved in the model's final decision and removing those features that should not play a role in the model's “reasoning” process.},

 abstract = {Diagnosing the knowledge mastery level of students on required concepts and providing tailored exercises to them is an essential task in e-learning environments. Due to the different knowledge level of students and the large scale of exercise banks, it is difficult for general recommenders to recommend suitable exercises for each student, which decreases their learning efficiency. In this paper, we develop a 2-layer multi-objective framework for exercise recommendation with self-attention networks, abbreviated as MulOER-SAN, to capture the change in students’ knowledge acquisition and thus provide customized exercise recommendations. Note that MulOER-SAN is a 2-layer framework. Via the bottom layer, a self-attention mechanism is adopted to predict the coverage in the next exercise, which can lead the learning process in the right direction. Moreover, we implement a novel knowledge tracing model with an enhanced self-attention sub-layer, thus tracing students’ dynamic knowledge state evolution. As the top layer of the 2-layer model, exercises are filtered according to the bottom layer’s predicted results, and the candidate subsets with appropriate difficulty and novelty are generated. From the perspective of diversity, we also carefully develop a chaotic sparrow search algorithm to further filter the candidate subset to avoid redundancy of recommended results. On the above basis, a simple yet effective difficulty smoothness factor is implemented to generate a high-quality ranking list in a real teaching application scenario. Comprehensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets have demonstrated that the proposed MulOER-SAN framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of various evaluation metrics.},

 abstract = {The early prediction of students' performance is a valuable resource to improve their learning. If we are able to detect at-risk students in the initial stages of the course, we will have more time to improve their performance. Likewise, excellent students could be motivated with customized additional activities. This is why there are research works aimed to early detect students’ performance. Some of them try to achieve it with the analysis of LMS log files, which store information about student interaction with the LMS. Many works create predictive models with the log files generated for the whole course, but those models are not useful for early prediction because the actual log information used for predicting is different to the one used to train the models. Other works do create predictive models with the log information retrieved at the early stages of courses, but they are just focused on a particular type of course. In this work, we use machine learning to create models for the early prediction of students' performance in solving LMS assignments, by just analyzing the LMS log files generated up to the moment of prediction. Moreover, our models are course agnostic, because the datasets are created with all the University of Oviedo1 courses for one academic year. We predict students' performance at 10%, 25%, 33% and 50% of the course length. Our objective is not to predict the exact student's mark in LMS assignments, but to detect at-risk, fail and excellent students in the early stages of the course. That is why we create different classification models for each of those three student groups. Decision tree, nave Bayes, logistic regression, multilayer perceptron (MLP) neural network, and support vector machine models are created and evaluated. Accuracies of all the models grow as the moment of prediction increases. Although all the algorithms but nave Bayes show accuracy differences lower than 5%, MLP obtains the best performance: from 80.1% accuracy when 10% of the course has been delivered to 90.1% when half of it has taken place. We also discuss the LMS log entries that most influence the students' performance. By using a clustering algorithm, we detect six different clusters of students regarding their interaction with the LMS. Analyzing the interaction patterns of each cluster, we find that those patterns are repeated in all the early stages of the course. Finally, we show how four out of those six student-LMS interaction patterns have a strong correlation with students' performance.},

Moreover, a limited number of studies scrutinised the impact of individual characteristics on learning outcomes as learners progress in a course. The current research aims to explore the dynamic impact of demographic characteristics on academic outcomes in the online learning environment. We investigated and compared the dynamic influence of six demographic characteristics on online learning outcomes using a sample of 8581 UK based learners across four Open University online courses from four different disciplines. We found region, neighborhood poverty level, and prior education respectively, to be strong predictors of overall learning outcomes. However, at a fine-grain level, such influence varied temporally as the course progressed, as well as between different courses. To conclude with, we discussed the implications for institutional support on adopting a tailored approach towards a more personalised student support system.},

Although identifying the role of entrepreneurship orientation as a critical success factor in project performance has been considered as an important issue, it is also important to develop a measurement system for predicting performance based on the degree of an individual's entrepreneurial orientation. In this study, we use predictive analytics by proposing a machine learning approach to predict individuals' project performance based on measures of several aspects of entrepreneurial orientation and entrepreneurial attitude of the individuals. We investigated this relationship using a sample of 185 observations and a range of machine learning algorithms including lasso, ridge, support vector machines, neural networks, and random forest. Our results showed that the best method for predicting project performance is lasso. After identifying the best predictive model, we then used the Bayesian Information Criterion and the Akaike Information Criterion to identify the most significant factors. Our results identify all three aspects of entrepreneurial attitude (social self-efficacy, appearance self-efficacy, and comparativeness) and one aspect of entrepreneurial orientation (proactiveness) as the most important factors. This study contributes to the relationship between entrepreneurship skills and project performance and provides insights into the application of emerging tools in data science and machine learning in operations management and project management research.},

Virtual Reality Training Systems (VRTS) provide an affordable and safe alternative for training in such high risk environments. However, their effectiveness relies mainly on having meaningful activities for supporting learning and on their ability to detect untrained students. This study builds a student model based on Learning Analytics (LA), using data collected from 1399 students that used a VRTS for the maintenance training of lineworkers in 329 courses carried out from 2008 to 2016. By employing several classifiers, the model allows discriminating between trained and untrained students in different maneuvers using three minimum evaluation proficiency scores. Using the best classifier, a Feature Importance Analysis is carried out to understand the impact of the variables regarding the trainees’ final performances. The model also involves the exploration of the trainees’ trace data through a visualization tool to pose non-observable behavioral variables related to displayed errors. The results show that the model can discriminate between trained and untrained students, the Random Forest algorithm standing out. The feature importance analysis revealed that the most relevant features regarding the trainees’ final performance were profile and course variables along with specific maneuver steps. Finally, using the visual tool, and with human expert aid, several error patterns in trace data associated with misconceptions and confusion were identified. In the light of these, LA enables disassembling the data jigsaw quandary from VRTS to enhance the human-in-the-loop evaluation.},

 abstract = {In higher education, providing personalized feedback and support to students is a significant challenge. Early warning systems can help by identifying both at-risk and high-performing students, allowing for timely interventions and enhanced learning opportunities. In our study, we used a year's worth of data from an information management school to build predictive models for two binary classification problems: identifying at-risk students and high-performing students. We employed traditional machine learning classifiers and long-short term memory units (LSTM), testing them at various stages of course completion. The best performance was achieved using all course data, with an AUC of 0.756 for at-risk students and 78.2% accuracy for high-performing students using Random Forest and Extremely Randomized Trees, respectively. We found that early prediction was possible as early as 25% course completion. Although LSTM showed inferior performance, it offered practical advantages for early prediction. Our findings suggest that static LMS logs can be reliable indicators of student success early in a course, and a course-agnostic time-dependent representation of the number of clicks can offer a worthwhile tradeoff between predictive performance and simplicity in implementation in some instances. These findings have important implications as they suggest the potential for automated early warning systems that can help educators identify students of interest and allocate resources where they are most needed. However, implementing these systems in real-time requires clear protocols and responsible policies. Further research should explore the generalizability of findings across different contexts and continuously evaluate their real-world effectiveness.},

Knowledge assessment is necessary for providing an adaptive learning environment. A student model serves as a fundamental building block of knowledge assessment in an adaptive learning environment. This paper intends to review the development of dominant families of student models with psychometric theory in early educational research, recent adaptations, and advances with machine learning and deep learning techniques. Our review covers not only the important families of student models but also why they were invented from both theoretical and practical viewpoints with AI and educational perspectives. We believe that the discussion covered in this review will be a valuable reference of introductory insights to AI for educational researchers, as well as an endeavor of introducing basic psychometric perspectives to AI experts for knowledge assessment in the field of learning science. Finally, we provide recent challenges and some potential directions for developing efficient knowledge assessment techniques in future adaptive learning ecosystems.},

 abstract = {The use of Emerging Technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), Learning Analytics (LA) and Extended Reality (XR) applications, in higher education has proliferated in recent times, as these technologies are considered to have a significant impact on the future of postsecondary teaching and learning. We wanted to find out the emerging technologies used in computing education, its evaluation and effectiveness, and limitations and gaps for future research. We carried out a Systematic Literature Review study on the use of Emerging Technologies in higher education computing education to identify the state of the art in the use of these three groups of technologies for assessment and feedback practices. After systematic search and filtering from a search pool of 3038 studies published between 2016 and 2021, we selected 38 articles for detailed meta-analysis. Our findings reveal that 71% of the reviewed studies are journal articles, 50% studies focus on learning analytics, and the majority of the studies employ quantitative approaches. The results from this systematic review suggest that XR technologies have received least attention to date in computing education (amongst the emerging technologies considered for the review) and there is a lack of frameworks for design, evaluation and use of emerging technologies in higher education. The findings of this review will be beneficial for researchers and educators to obtain an in-depth understanding of the main areas of application of emerging technologies in higher education computing education, an inventory of emerging technology tools used for assessment and feedback, effectiveness indicators, and evaluation approaches that have been used. For evidence-based guidance on future assessment and feedback practices using emerging technologies, we also present a brief research agenda, drawing attention to the need to trial more XR, focus on formative assessment and feedback practices, better understand impact of human-centric issues and take more thoughtful consideration of ethics in the use of emerging technologies in computing education.},

Academic help-seeking is a quite prevalent phenomenon that supports students to learn knowledge and improve academic performance. This study is aiming to understand learners and associate their performances via exploiting academic help-seeking moods with online learning of institutional education setting. Adopting the relevant theories, we propose a novel research model and identify three different online help-seeking moods, which are namely goal-directed seeker, exploratory seeker and avoidant seeker. Goal-directed seekers are described with preference for more challenging assignments and more posting on the platform discussion board frequently. Exploratory seekers hold the highest achievements during all help-seeking moods. Avoidant seekers are well-distinguished by holding the lowest frequency of posting among all moods and the most average time spent on the platform. Students have collective preferences for assignment submission in each help-seeking mood, and deviation from those preferences increases their probability of dropping academic grade significantly. To the best of our knowledge, this research is the first work that characterizes the help-seeking moods and associates moods with the enrollment performance for online education of institutional student.},

 abstract = {Major issues currently restricting the use of learning analytics are the lack of interpretability and adaptability of the machine learning models used in this domain. Interpretability makes it easy for the stakeholders to understand the working of these models and adaptability makes it easy to use the same model for multiple cohorts and courses in educational institutions. Recently, some models in learning analytics are constructed with the consideration of interpretability but their interpretability is not quantified. However, adaptability is not specifically considered in this domain. This paper presents a new framework based on hybrid statistical fuzzy theory to overcome these limitations. It also provides explainability in the form of rules describing the reasoning behind a particular output. The paper also discusses the system evaluation on a benchmark dataset showing promising results. The measure of explainability, fuzzy index, shows that the model is highly interpretable. This system achieves more than 82% recall in both the classification and the context adaptation stages.},

 abstract = {Knowledge Tracing (KT) aims to trace the student’s state of evolutionary mastery for a particular knowledge or concept based on the student’s historical learning interactions with the corresponding exercises. Taking the “exercise-to-concept” relationships as input, several existing methods have been developed to trace and model students’ mastery states. However, these studies face two major shortcomings in KT: 1) they only consider “exercise-to-concept” relationships; 2) the multi-hot embeddings lack interpretability. In order to address the above issues, we propose a Joint graph convolutional network based deep Knowledge Tracing (JKT) framework to model the multi-dimensional relationships of “exercise-to-exercise”, and “concept-to-concept” into graph and fuse them with “exercise-to-concept” relationships. In JKT, it is not only possible to establish connections between exercises under cross-concepts, but also to help capture high-level semantic information and increase the model’s interpretability. In addition, sufficient experiments conducted on four real-world datasets have demonstrated that JKT performs better than the other baseline models. We further illustrate a case study to demonstrate its interpretability for learning analysis},

 abstract = {The goal of Knowledge Tracing (KT) is to estimate how well students have mastered a concept based on their historical learning of related exercises. The benefit of knowledge tracing is that students’ learning plans can be better organised and adjusted, and interventions can be made when necessary. With the recent rise of deep learning, Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT) has utilised Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to accomplish this task with some success. Other works have attempted to introduce Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and redefine the task accordingly to achieve significant improvements. However, these efforts suffer from at least one of the following drawbacks: (1) they pay too much attention to details of the nodes rather than to high-level semantic information; (2) they struggle to effectively establish spatial associations and complex structures of the nodes; and (3) they represent either concepts or exercises only, without integrating them. Inspired by recent advances in self-supervised learning, we propose a Bi-Graph Contrastive Learning based Knowledge Tracing (Bi-CLKT) to address these limitations. Specifically, we design a two-layer comparative learning scheme based on an “exercise-to-exercise” (E2E) relational subgraph. It involves node-level contrastive learning of subgraphs to obtain discriminative representations of exercises, and graph-level contrastive learning to obtain discriminative representations of concepts. Moreover, we designed a joint contrastive loss to obtain better representations and hence better prediction performance. Also, we explored two different variants, using RNN and memory-augmented neural networks as the prediction layer for comparison to obtain better representations of exercises and concepts respectively. Extensive experiments on four real-world datasets show that the proposed Bi-CLKT and its variants outperform other baseline models.},

 abstract = {In intelligent education systems, one fundamental task is to predict student performance on new exercises and estimate the knowledge proficiency of students on knowledge concepts. Existing prediction methods are mainly constructed based on the classical cognitive diagnosis framework MIRT, where student performance on exercises are modeled as the interaction results of exercises’ trait vectors and students’ knowledge proficiency. The trait vector learning of exercises has a big effect on the estimation results of the knowledge proficiency. However, when learning the trait vectors, existing methods cannot exploit the rich contents of cross-modal exercises that are closely related to the traits of exercises. This makes it difficult for these methods to best cope with common cross-modal exercises. Besides, existing methods overlook the intrinsic complexity of examined concepts, which actually affects exercise traits, such as exercise difficulty. To address these issues, we propose a deep Cross-Modal Neural Cognitive Diagnosis framework (CMNCD), which mainly has two appealing advantages: (i) By extending MIRT under the framework of deep neural networks, CMNCD can effectively explore the fine-grained semantic information in the cross-modal contents of exercises for modeling student performance. (ii) CMNCD investigates the complexity of examined concepts based on the prerequisite relationships among concepts and incorporates it into the learning of exercises’ trait vectors. Extensive experiments on several real-world datasets show that our CMNCD outperforms state-of-the-art cognitive diagnosis methods.},

 abstract = {Knowledge Tracing (KT), namely tracking the knowledge conditions of each student across time, has always been challenging due to the latent and time-varying characteristics of knowledge states. Traditional psychometrical frameworks lack the ability to extract rich representations of exercises or examinees. Deep learning KT models have shown comparable performances, but uninterpretable model parameters have limited their applications. Furthermore, existing frameworks usually cannot handle temporal factors appropriately, as most of them simply apply stochastic processes to simulate fluctuations on knowledge states over time. In this paper, we propose a new framework named Time-and-Concept Enhanced Deep Multidimensional Item Response Theory (TC-MIRT) that integrates the parameters of a Multidimensional Item Response Theory into an improved recurrent neural network. Specifically, two enhanced components are constructed to empower our model with the ability to perform trend forecasting and to generate explainable parameters in each specific domain of knowledge. Experiments implemented on two real-world datasets show that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art KT approaches on performance prediction tasks. Moreover, extensive case analyses also demonstrate that the interpretable parameters of TC-MIRT can be used to evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of students.},

 abstract = {For intelligent tutoring systems, Cognitive Diagnosis (CD) is a fundamental task that aims to estimate the mastery degree of a student on each skill according to the exercise record. The CD task is considered rather challenging since we need to model inner-relations and inter-relations among students, skills, and questions to obtain more abundant information. Most existing methods attempt to solve this problem through two-way interactions between students and questions (or between students and skills), ignoring potential high-order relations among entities. Furthermore, how to construct an end-to-end framework that can model the complex interactions among different types of entities at the same time remains unexplored. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a graph-based Cognitive Diagnosis model (GCDM) that directly discovers the interactions among students, skills, and questions through a heterogeneous cognitive graph. Specifically, we design two graph-based layers: a performance-relative propagator and an attentive knowledge aggregator. The former is applied to propagate a student’s cognitive state through different types of graph edges, while the latter selectively gathers messages from neighboring graph nodes. Extensive experimental results on two real-world datasets clearly show the effectiveness and extendibility of our proposed model.},

 abstract = {Knowledge Tracing (KT) aims to continuously estimate students’ evolving knowledge state during their learning process, which has attracted much research attention due to its potential for delivering personalized and optimal experiences to students in intelligent learning systems. The learning process is essentially the pairwise interactions of Students, Concepts, and Questions (S–C, S–Q, C–Q for short). Modeling all these interactions will improve the performance of KT. However, existing KT methods hardly exploit all the interactions in a single model. Specifically, Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT) and most of its variants neglect C–Q; Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT) and other deep neural network approaches mostly neglect S–Q and C–Q. We propose the Ensemble Knowledge Tracing (EnKT), which models all three types of interactions. The base model of EnKT is a hybrid of BKT and DKT. We also present an ensemble algorithm Recurrent Boosting (RB), which extends AdaBoost to deal with KT sequential data. Inspired by BKT, EnKT represents S–C and S–Q using learning and performance parameters, respectively. Besides, EnKT defines C–Q as the correlation complexity among the concepts involved in a question. Experiments show EnKT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods (by up to 6% in AUC in some cases) on four real-world benchmark datasets and illustrate better interpretability by several typical case studies.},

 abstract = {Knowledge Tracing (KT) focuses on modeling the exercise process of students, assessing their knowledge state changes during the exercise process, and further providing targeted guidance for teaching and learning. Current KT models have made significant progress by utilizing deep learning technologies to model relevant attributes of the questions. However, in current knowledge tracing strategies, we have yet to exhaustively explore how to precisely evaluate the hierarchies of students’ knowledge mastery to better discern their current target hierarchy. To address the limitations of the KT model in accurately identifying and positioning target hierarchy, our research focuses on two key areas: first, we dynamically track students’ target hierarchies by evaluating their feedback on questions at different hierarchies ; second, we assess their actual question-solving abilities within these target hierarchies, thereby optimizing our evaluation of their knowledge status. Based on these insights, we propose the Target Hierarchy-guided Knowledge Tracing (THKT) model. In this model, we first incorporate the identification of question hierarchy into the model representation. Then, to avoid homogenization of the target hierarchy, we dynamically track the appropriate hierarchy for students based on their varying feedback to questions of the same hierarchy, thereby pinpointing their learning target hierarchies. Simultaneously, we develop a KCs applied ability learning module that works in conjunction with the target hierarchies to generate interpretable prediction results. The proposed THKT model has been tested and evaluated using three public, real-world educational datasets. The findings clearly demonstrate that our approach shines in the realm of KT prediction tasks, providing significantly interpretability.

 abstract = {Modern intelligent systems nowadays make significant use of human–computer interaction (HCI). Questions of human perception, human intelligence, human cognitive capabilities, human decision-making capabilities, and interactive techniques of visualization are dealt with by HCI. Whereas, the questions of machine intelligence and data mining is dealt with by knowledge discovery in databases (KDD). HCI mainly emphasizes supervised methods. Automatic computational methods can be worked upon by combining the capabilities of both HCI and KDD. The development of algorithms that are scalable for discovering earlier unknown associations in the data thus are based on automatic computational methods by combining the capabilities of both. The first HCI happens in the primitive years of a child. The digital era we are living in and all the more pandemics have made our education system adapt to the newest technology with open hands. Challenging times in the field of education have been conquered by the fast adaptation of the latest technology and trends. It is not going to stop here and will become an integral part of our education system. The latest technologies like artificial intelligence and data mining are known for their predictive capabilities and can play a significant role in the field of education, specifically in the higher education system. Every year a substantial number of graduates strive in the job market for decent employment opportunities. On the contrary, the economy of the world is not generating adequate employment opportunities. The pandemic has made the situation even worse with lots of job cutdowns. To increase the possibility of obtaining a decent job, institutes need to improve their academic qualification. They should also equip students with essential employability skills. Accurate prediction of graduates' employability at early stages such as in the very first year of their course enrollment can be of great help. This chapter projects a proposal for building a system that applies the KDD–HCI integrated approach by showcasing a case study for prediction of employability in higher education by using data generated and stored after HCI in various tests. The framework proposed in this chapter provides a generalized solution to students' employability prediction by integrating supervised and unsupervised techniques of artificial intelligence. These skills can be tested first with HCI by conducting various tests of students at the entry level. The scores obtained then go through the process of employability prediction with the help of the proposed framework, which can help in deciding the skills to be improved in an individual student before they compete, thus improving the chance of selection. Therefore, the proposed framework provides a customized solution to every student.},

 abstract = {Uncertainty is a key feature of any machine learning model and is particularly important in neural networks, which tend to be overconfident. This overconfidence is worrying under distribution shifts, where the model performance silently degrades as the data distribution diverges from the training data distribution. Uncertainty estimation offers a solution to overconfident models, communicating when the output should (not) be trusted. Although methods for uncertainty estimation have been developed, they have not been explicitly linked to the field of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI). Furthermore, literature in operations research ignores the actionability component of uncertainty estimation and does not consider distribution shifts. This work proposes a general uncertainty framework, with contributions being threefold: (i) uncertainty estimation in ML models is positioned as an XAI technique, giving local and model-specific explanations; (ii) classification with rejection is used to reduce misclassifications by bringing a human expert in the loop for uncertain observations; (iii) the framework is applied to a case study on neural networks in educational data mining subject to distribution shifts. Uncertainty as XAI improves the model’s trustworthiness in downstream decision-making tasks, giving rise to more actionable and robust machine learning systems in operations research.},

For both classification and regression tasks, the overall highest precision was obtained with artificial neural networks by feeding the student engagement data and past performance data, while the usage of demographic data did not show significant influence on the precision of predictions.

The proposed approach is devised to generate instances, which are augmented with the actual data to eliminate class imbalance.

 abstract = {To address the demands of modern education and increase flexibility, many higher education institutions are considering self-paced education programs. However, student retention is yet a widely recognized challenge faced in self-paced education. While many studies have examined the potential of the use of data about student interaction with learning technologies to predict student success, studies that focus on self-paced education are scarce. To address this gap in the literature, this paper reports on the findings of a study that has investigated the performance of a well-known deep learning technique i.e., Long Short-term Memory (LSTM), in the prediction of students at risk of failing a course offered in a self-paced mode of online education. The study has utilized a freely accessible Open University Learning Analytics Dataset comprising 22,437 students with 69 % pass, and 31 % failed instances. The deep LSTM shows the highest predictive power to classify between pass and fail students, compared to all other alternatives by achieving an accuracy of 84.57 %, precision of 82.24 % and recall of 79.43 %. Interestingly, with only first five weeks of course activity log data used for training, the receiver operating characteristic based diagnostic accuracy of the LSTM algorithm is achieved up to 71 %, that outperforms almost all other conventional algorithms - despite trained on the complete dataset collected for the entire duration of the course i.e. up to 38 weeks. Furthermore, this study has also employed a shapely additive explanation model to identify the most important predictors of student retention, e.g., assessment submission and attempted quizzes. This approach is essential in order to increase the interpretability of deep learning techniques and, thus, increase their potential to generate actionable insights.},

 abstract = {Flipped classrooms supported by learning management systems (LMS) have been widely adopted by educational institutions. However, earlier studies have found problems with interpreting LMS log data to understand student approaches to learning within the context of a learning design. This study investigates whether it is possible to use LMS log data as a proxy to understand students' learning strategies over different periods of time in the flipped-classroom context. A total of 135 sophomores from two classes of a flipped programming course participated in this study. Exploratory factor analysis is first conducted on the log data to synthesize second-order predictors based on the total-effort model. Then, we investigate the extent to which these second-order predictors relate to students' learning outcomes over time. Four types of learning outcomes are considered, including a quiz, a midterm exam, a final exam and the final grade. For each type of learning outcome, multiple linear regression is used to construct a weekly prediction model from these predictors. Adjusted R-squared and RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) are the metrics used to compare the models. The results show that consistent second-order predictors can be derived from log data, implying that students' clicking events in LMS could manifest students' learning strategies understandable in the design context of a flipped classroom. Furthermore, compared with the first-order models, most of the models constructed using the second-order predictors have higher predictive performance, although with lower data fitness. In addition, the predictive performance of the models with MSLQ (Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire) indicators and past assessment data are also examined. It is found that MSQL variables have a positive but short-termed effect on the models’ predictive ability, while past assessment data greatly improve the models of all types of learning outcomes. Theoretical contributions and implications of the proposed approach for practice, research and future research are discussed.},

It is important to build a DL-based, fine-grained student performance prediction model to predict students’ outcomes and learning status at every stage of their course, rather than merely predicting the students’ final score and drop-out rate, which is referred to as coarse-grained performance. In this paper, we tackle the problem of fine-grained student performance prediction in an online course using DL-based long sequence generation by formulating the students’ feature as a matrix where elements in certain parts are missing. We propose an adaptive sparse self-attention network to generate the missing values and simultaneously predict the fine-grained performance. The matrix representation of the features facilitates position-wise feature selection, which helps to find the most correlated components from the past learning stage, leading to an embedding with both the original features and their spatial relationships. We build a deep neural network model with several sparse self-attention layers stacked together to achieve sequence generation. Experimental studies on three real-world datasets from different e-learning platforms demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of our proposed method.},

 abstract = {Quiz question annotation aims to assign the most relevant knowledge point to a question, which is a key technology to support intelligent education applications. However, the existing methods only extract the explicit semantic information that reveals the literal meaning of a question, and ignore the implicit knowledge information that highlights the knowledge intention. To this end, an innovative dual-channel model, the Semantic-Knowledge Mapping Network (S-KMN) is proposed to enrich the question representation from two perspectives, semantic and knowledge, simultaneously. It integrates semantic features learning and knowledge mapping network (KMN) to extract explicit semantic features and implicit knowledge features of questions,respectively. Designing KMN to extract implicit knowledge features is the focus of this study. First, the context-aware and sequence information of knowledge attribute words in the question text is integrated into the knowledge attribute graph to form the knowledge representation of each question. Second, learning a projection matrix, which maps the knowledge representation to the latent knowledge space based on the scene base vectors, and the weighted summations of these base vectors serve as knowledge features. To enrich the question representation, an attention mechanism is introduced to fuse explicit semantic features and implicit knowledge features, which realizes further cognitive processing on the basis of understanding semantics. The experimental results on 19,410 real-world physics quiz questions in 30 knowledge points demonstrate that the S-KMN outperforms the state-of-the-art text classification-based question annotation method. Comprehensive analysis and ablation studies validate the superiority of our model in selecting knowledge-specific features.},

 abstract = {The student academic performance prediction is becoming an indispensable service in the computer supported intelligent education system. But conventional machine learning-based methods can only exploit the sparse discriminative features of student behaviors in imbalanced academic datasets to predict student academic performance (SAP). Furthermore, there is a lack of imbalanced data processing mechanisms that can efficiently capture student characteristics and achievement. Therefore, we propose a comprehensive and high-performance prediction framework to probe SAP characteristics (ProbSAP) on massive educational data, which can resolve imbalanced data issue and improve academic prediction performance for making course final mark prediction. It consists of three main components: collaborative data processing module for enhancing the data quality, scalable metadata clustering module for alleviating the imbalance of academic features, and XGBoost-enhanced SAP prediction module for academic performance forecasting. The collaborative data processing module integrates multi-dimensional academic data, which sustains a good supply for clustering and modeling in the ProbSAP framework. The comparative evaluation results demonstrate that ProbSAP delivers superior accuracy and efficiency improvement for the course final mark prediction of college students over other state-of-the-art methods such as CNN, SVR, RFR, XGBoost, Catboost-SHAP, and AS-SAN. On average, ProbSAP reduces the mean absolute error (MAE) by 84.76%, 72.11%, and 66.49% compared with XGBoost, Catboost-SHAP, and AS-SAN, respectively. It also leads to a better out-sample fit that minimizes prediction errors between 1% and 9% with over 98% of actual samples.},

To address these issues, we introduce the Large Language Model enhanced Signed Bipartite graph Contrastive Learning (LLM-SBCL) model—a novel Multimodal Model utilizing Signed Graph Neural Networks (SGNNs) and a Large Language Model (LLM).

Yet, existing research often miss the complex interplay between student characteristics and knowledge components, limiting interpretability and adaptability in assessments. Addressing this gap, we introduce the Ontology Perceptible Knowledge Tracing (OPKT) model, a novel approach that reconceptualizes student-knowledge interaction by integrating both student and knowledge ontologies directly into the tracing process. This integration allows for a more nuanced representation of learning interactions, significantly enhancing the predictive precision and interpretability of the model. The OPKT model extracts and utilizes ontology features—deriving student attributes from behavioral data and aligning them with knowledge aspects through sophisticated relationship mapping. This dual-layer integration captures the evolution of knowledge states more accurately, facilitating targeted educational interventions. The results of prediction on two publicly available datasets demonstrate that our proposed OPKT model achieves at least a 2% improvement in AUC, accurately assessing students’ learning outcomes and knowledge proficiency.

Specifically, the prediction accuracy of the improved network for sports performance surpasses that of the original U-Net by 4.22 % and exceeds that of DUNet by 5.22 %. Compared with other existing prediction networks, the improved U-Net CNN model exhibits a superior achievement prediction ability. Consequently, the proposed system enhances teaching and learning efficiency and offers insights into applying artificial intelligence technology to smart classroom development.},

 abstract = {Educational Data Mining (EDM) has emerged over the last two decades,
concerning with the development and implementation of data mining
methods in order to facilitate the analysis of vast amounts of data
originating from a wide variety of educational contexts. Predicting
students' progression and learning outcomes, such as dropout,
performance and course grades, is regarded among the most important
tasks of the EDM field. Therefore, applying appropriate machine learning
algorithms for building accurate predictive models is of outmost
importance for both educators and data scientists. Considering the
high-dimensional input space and the complexity of machine learning
algorithms, the process of building accurate and robust learning models
requires advanced data science skills, while is time-consuming and
error-prone in most cases. In addition, choosing the proper method for a
given problem formulation and configuring the optimal parameters' values
for a specific model is a demanding task, whilst it is often very
difficult to understand and explain the produced results. In this
context, the main purpose of the present study is to examine the
potential use of advanced machine learning strategies on educational
settings from the perspective of hyperparameter optimization. More
specifically, we investigate the effectiveness of automated Machine
Learning (autoML) for the task of predicting students' learning outcomes
based on their participation in online learning platforms. At the same
time, we limit the search space to tree-based and rule-based models in
order to achieving transparent and interpretable results. To this end, a
plethora of experiments were carried out, revealing that autoML tools
achieve consistently superior results. Hopefully our work will help
nonexpert users (e.g., educators and instructors) in the field of EDM to
conduct experiments with appropriate automated parameter configurations,
thus achieving highly accurate and comprehensible results.},

 abstract = {Background Educational psychology research has linked fluid intelligence
(Gf) with working memory (WM), but it is still dubious whether
electroencephalography (EEG) markers robustly indicate Gf. This study
addresses this issue and notes the relationship between WM task-related
EEG markers with Gf and academic performance. Method A sample of 62
healthy children between the ages of 9 and 12 years was selected to
perform three tasks: (1) Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices (RSPM)
test to assess Gf; (2) 2-back task to assess central executive system
(CES); and (3) delayed match-to-sample task to assess short-term
storage. These subjects were divided into high ability (HA) and low
ability (LA) groups based on their RSPM scores. Support vector machine
and logistic regression were used to train the EEG candidate indicators.
A multiple regression was used to predict children's academic
performance using P3 amplitude, P2 latency, and theta-ERS. Results
Behavioral results demonstrated that the correct rate of the HA group is
higher than that of the LA group. The event-related potential results of
the 2-back task showed that the P3 amplitude of the HA group was
relatively larger and that the P2 latency was shorter than that observed
in the LA group. For the delayed matching to sample task, the theta-ERS
of the LA group was higher than that of the HA group. However, the area
under the curve of these three indicators for Gf was < 0.75 for each and
< 0.85 for the combined indicators. In predicting academic performance,
only P3 amplitude showed a significant effect. Conclusion These results
challenge previous findings, which reported that P3, P2, or theta power
might be used in standard psychometric tests to assess an individual's
intelligence.},

 abstract = {The measurement of student performance during their progress through
university study provides academic leadership with critical information
on each student's likelihood of success. Academics have traditionally
used their interactions with individual students through class
activities and interim assessments to identify those ``at risk{''} of
failure/withdrawal. However, modern university environments, offering
easy on-line availability of course material, may see reduced
lecture/tutorial attendance, making such identification more
challenging. Modern data mining and machine learning techniques provide
increasingly accurate predictions of student examination assessment
marks, although these approaches have focussed upon large student
populations and wide ranges of data attributes per student. However,
many university modules comprise relatively small student cohorts, with
institutional protocols limiting the student attributes available for
analysis. It appears that very little research attention has been
devoted to this area of analysis and prediction. We describe an
experiment conducted on a final-year university module student cohort of
23, where individual student data are limited to lecture/tutorial
attendance, virtual learning environment accesses and intermediate
assessments. We found potential for predicting individual student
interim and final assessment marks in small student cohorts with very
limited attributes and that these predictions could be useful to support
module leaders in identifying students potentially ``at risk.{''}},

 abstract = {Recently, tracking student behavior has become a very important phase
for constructing adaptive educational systems. Several researchers have
developed various methods based on machine learning for better tracing
students' knowledge. Most of these methods have shown an effective
estimation of student features and an accurate prediction of future
performance. However, these methods recognized certain limitations since
they use only the correctness of prior student responses to make
predictions without paying attention to many other important student
behaviors. In addition, researchers have only considered scaffolding
items as a pure method of learning without having analyzed student
performance at the time of answering these items. Our purpose in this
article is to conduct an experiment that aims to evaluate how best to
use data about the prior required scaffolding items to predict future
student performance. For this reason, we proposed two separate models,
namely, the first one identifies whether a student has previously
required to use scaffolding items prior main question or has immediately
answered it without requiring assistance. For the second model, as an
improvement of model 1, our objective is to improve the student's
performance under the constraint of answering scaffolding items. The
performance of our two models is evaluated against the original
Performance Factors Analysis algorithm to mark differences. The results
show that the two proposed models provide a positive improvement in
predicting the future performance of students. Moreover, our second
model can reliably increase the predictive accuracy.},

 abstract = {The large volume of data and its complexity in educational institutions
require the sakes from informative technologies. In order to facilitate
this task, many researchers have focused on using machine learning to
extract knowledge from the education database to support students and
instructors in getting better performance. In prediction models, the
challenging task is to choose the effective techniques which could
produce satisfying predictive accuracy. Hence, in this work, we
introduced a hybrid approach of principal component analysis (PCA) as
conjunction with four machines learning (ML) algorithms: random forest
(RF), C5.0 of decision tree (DT), and naive Bayes (NB) of Bayes network
and support vector machine (SVM), to improve the performances of
classification by solving the misclassification problem. Three datasets
were used to confirm the robustness of the proposed models. Through the
given datasets, we evaluated the classification accuracy and root mean
square error (RSME) as evaluation metrics of the proposed models. In
this classification problem, 10-fold cross-validation was proposed to
evaluate the predictive performance. The proposed hybrid models produced
very prediction results which shown itself as the optimal prediction and
classification algorithms.},

 abstract = {This article addresses the problem of performance prediction in a
flipped learning course on digital systems. The course is a part of a
first-year Engineering degree offered at a public university. The extent
to which failure at the end of the course can be anticipated is analyzed
by examining the students' behavior related to academic activities. This
prediction will be made by considering whether students perform
different activities as instructed. The timeframe is also limited to the
early stages of the course. Although anticipating results at early
stages on the basis of behavioral aspects makes it possible to redress
the behavior of at-risk students, at the same time, it also introduces
limitations for potential models. As there are no assessments during the
early period, no course activity grades will be available for modeling
purposes. In this study, different data mining techniques will be used,
which will offer better results. Results will be analyzed in terms of
the performance of at-risk students and compared with previous research
studies. Models will also provide information about factors of relevance
for the academic success of the course.},

 abstract = {This paper illustrates how to use data mining techniques to help in
advising students and predicting their academic performance. Data mining
is used to get previously unknown, hidden and perhaps vital knowledge
from a large amount of data. It combines domain knowledge, advanced
analytical skills, and a vast knowledge base to reveal hidden patterns
and trends that are applicable in virtually any sector ranging from
engineering to medicine, to business. However, it is possible for
educational institutes to use data mining to find useful information
from their databases. This is usually called Educational Data Mining
(EDM). Advancing the field of EDM with new data analysis techniques and
new machine learning algorithms is vital. Classification and clustering
techniques will be used in this project to study and analyse student
performance. The key importance of this project is that it discusses
different data mining techniques in the literature review to study
student behaviour depending upon their performance. We tried to identify
the most suitable algorithms from the existing research methods to
predict the success of students. Various data mining approaches were
discussed and their results were evaluated. In this paper, the J48
algorithm was applied to the data set, gathered from Umm Al-Qura
University in Makkah.},

 abstract = {An admissions system based on valid and reliable admissions criteria is
very important to select candidates likely to perform well academically
at institutions of higher education. This study focuses on ways to
support universities in admissions decision making using data mining
techniques to predict applicants \& x2019; academic performance at
university. A data set of 2,039 students enrolled in a Computer Science
and Information College of a Saudi public university from 2016 to 2019
was used to validate the proposed methodology. The results demonstrate
that applicants \& x2019; early university performance can be predicted
before admission based on certain pre-admission criteria (high school
grade average, Scholastic Achievement Admission Test score, and General
Aptitude Test score). The results also show that Scholastic Achievement
Admission Test score is the pre-admission criterion that most accurately
predicts future student performance. Therefore, this score should be
assigned more weight in admissions systems. We also found that the
Artificial Neural Network technique has an accuracy rate above 79 \&
x0025;, making it superior to other classification techniques considered
(Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, and Na \& x00EF;ve Bayes).},

 abstract = {Transferring knowledge from one domain to another has gained a lot of
attention among scientists in recent years. Transfer learning is a
machine learning approach aiming to exploit the knowledge retrieved from
one problem for improving the predictive performance of a learning model
for a different but related problem. This is particularly the case when
there is a lack of data regarding a problem, but there is plenty of data
about another related one. To this end, the present study intends to
investigate the effectiveness of transfer learning from deep neural
networks for the task of students' performance prediction in higher
education. Since building predictive models in the Educational Data
Mining field through transfer learning methods has been poorly studied
so far, we consider this study as an important step in this direction.
Therefore, a plethora of experiments were conducted based on data
originating from five compulsory courses of two undergraduate programs.
The experimental results demonstrate that the prognosis of students at
risk of failure can be achieved with satisfactory accuracy in most
cases, provided that datasets of students who have attended other
related courses are available.},

 abstract = {As students' behaviors are important factors that can reflect their
learning styles and living habits on campus, extracting useful features
of them plays a helpful role in understanding the students' learning
process, which is an important step towards personalized education.
Recently, the task of predicting students' performance from their campus
behaviors has aroused the researchers' attention. However, existing
studies mainly focus on extracting statistical features manually from
the pre-stored data, resulting in hysteresis in predicting students'
achievement and finding out their problems. Furthermore, due to the
limited representation capability of these manually extracted features,
they can only understand the students' behaviors shallowly. To make the
prediction process timely and automatically, we treat the performance
prediction task as a short-term sequence prediction problem, and propose
a two-stage classification framework, i.e., Sequence-based Performance
Classifier (SPC), which consists of a sequence encoder and a classic
data mining classifier. More specifically, to deeply discover the
sequential features from students' campus behaviors, we first introduce
an attention-based Hybrid Recurrent Neural Network (HRNN) to encode
their recent behaviors by giving a higher weight to the ones that are
related to the students' last action. Then, to conduct student
performance prediction, we further involve these learned features to the
classic Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm and finally achieve our
SPC model. We conduct extensive experiments in the real-world student
card dataset. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of
our proposed method in terms of Accuracy and Recall.},

 abstract = {The ability to predict students' academic performance is critical for
any educational institution that aims to improve their students'
learning process and achievement. Although students' performance
prediction problem is studied widely, it still represents a challenge
and complex issue for educational institutions due to the different
features that affect students learning process and achievement in
courses. Moreover, the utilization of web-based learning systems in
education provides opportunities to study how students learning and what
learning behavior leading them to success. The main objective of this
research was to investigate the impact of assessment grades and online
activity data in the Learning Management System (LMS) on students'
academic performance. Based on one of the commonly used data mining
techniques for prediction, called classification. Five classification
algorithms were applied that decision tree, random forest, sequential
minimal optimization, multilayer perceptron, and logistic regression.
Experimental results revealed that assessment grades are the most
important features affecting students' academic performance. Moreover,
prediction models that included assessment grades alone or in
combination with activity data perform better than models based on
activity data alone. Also, random forest algorithm performs well for
predicting student a cademic performance, followed by decision tree.},

 abstract = {Student performance prediction has become a hot research topic. Most of
the existing prediction models are built by a machine learning method.
They are interested in prediction accuracy but pay less attention to
interpretability. We propose a stacking ensemble model to predict and
analyze student performance in academic competition. In this model,
student performance is classified into two symmetrical categorical
classes. To improve accuracy, three machine learning algorithms,
including support vector machine (SVM), random forest, and AdaBoost are
established in the first level and then integrated by logistic
regression via stacking. A feature importance analysis was applied to
identify important variables. The experimental data were collected from
four academic years in Hankou University. According to comparative
studies on five evaluation metrics (precision, recall, F1, error, and
area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) in this
analysis, the proposed model generally performs better than compared
models. The important variables identified from the analysis are
interpretable, they can be used as guidance to select potential
students.},

 abstract = {Student performance modelling is one of the challenging and popular
research topics in educational data mining (EDM). Multiple factors
influence the performance in non-linear ways; thus making this field
more attractive to the researchers. The widespread availability of e
ducational datasets further catalyse this interestingness, especially in
online learning. Although several EDM surveys are available in the
literature, we could find only a few specific surveys on student
performance analysis and prediction. These specific surveys are limited
in nature and primarily focus on studies that try to identify possible
predictor or model student performance. However, the previous works do
not address the temporal aspect of prediction. Moreover, we could not
find any such specific survey which focuses only on classroom-based
education. In this paper, we present a systematic review of EDM studies
on student performance in classroom learning. It focuses on identifying
the predictors, methods used for such identification, time and aim of
prediction. It is significantly the first systematic survey of EDM
studies that consider only classroom learning and focuses on the
temporal aspect as well. This paper presents a review of 140 studies in
this area. The meta-analysis indicates that the researchers achieve
significant prediction efficiency during the tenure of the course.
However, performance prediction before course commencement needs special
attention.},

 abstract = {The aim of this paper is to survey recent research publications that use
Soft Computing methods to answer education-related problems based on the
analysis of educational data `mined' mainly from interactive/e-learning
systems. Such systems are known to generate and store large volumes of
data that can be exploited to assess the learner, the system and the
quality of the interaction between them. Educational Data Mining (EDM)
and Learning Analytics (LA) are two distinct and yet closely related
research areas that focus on this data aiming to address open
education-related questions or issues. Besides `classic' data analysis
methods such as clustering, classification, identification or
regression/analysis of variances,soft computingmethods are often
employed by EDM and LA researchers to achieve their various tasks. Their
very nature as iterative optimization algorithms that avoid the
exhaustive search of the solutions space and go for possibly suboptimal
solutions yet at realistic time and effort, along with their heavy
reliance on rich data sets for training, make soft computing methods
ideal tools for the EDM or LA type of problems. Decision trees, random
forests, artificial neural networks, fuzzy logic, support vector
machines and genetic/evolutionary algorithms are a few examples of soft
computing approaches that, given enough data, can successfully deal with
uncertainty, qualitatively stated problems and incomplete, imprecise or
even contradictory data sets - features that the field of education
shares with all humanities/social sciences fields. The present review
focuses, therefore, on recent EDM and LA research that employs at least
one soft computing method, and aims to identify (i) the majoreducation
problems/issuesaddressed and, consequently,research goals/objectivesset,
(ii) thelearning contexts/settingswithin which relevant research and
educational interventions take place, (iii) the relation betweenclassic
and soft computing methodsemployed to solve specific problems/issues,
and (iv) the means of dissemination (publication journals)of the
relevant research results. Selection and analysis of a body of 300
journal publications reveals that top research questions in education
today seeking answers through soft computing methods refer directly to
the issue ofquality- a critical issue given the currently dominant
educational/pedagogical models that favor e-learning or computer- or
technology-mediated learning contexts. Moreover, results identify the
most frequently used methods and tools within EDM/LA research and,
comparatively, within their soft computing subsets, along with the major
journals relevant research is being published worldwide. Weaknesses and
issues that need further attention in order to fully exploit the
benefits of research results to improve both the learning experience and
the learning outcomes are discussed in the conclusions.},

 abstract = {In higher education, the initial studying period of each course plays a
crucial role for students, and seriously influences the subsequent
learning activities. However, given the large size of a course's
students at universities, it has become impossible for teachers to keep
track of the performance of individual students. In this circumstance,
an academic early warning system is desirable, which automatically
detects students with difficulties in learning (i.e., at-risk students)
prior to a course starting. However, previous studies are not well
suited to this purpose for two reasons: 1) they have mainly concentrated
on e-learning platforms, e.g., massive open online courses (MOOCs), and
relied on the data about students' online activities, which is hardly
accessed in traditional teaching scenarios; and 2) they have only made
performance prediction when a course is in progress or even close to the
end. In this paper, for traditional classroom-teaching scenarios, we
investigate the task of pre-course student performance prediction, which
refers to detecting at-risk students for each course before its
commencement. To better represent a student sample and utilize the
correlations among courses, we cast the problem as a multi-instance
multi-label (MIML) problem. Besides, given the problem of data scarcity,
we propose a novel multi-task learning method, i.e., MIML-Circle, to
predict the performance of students from different specialties in a
unified framework. Extensive experiments are conducted on five
real-world datasets, and the results demonstrate the superiority of our
approach over the state-of-the-art methods.},

 abstract = {Predicting students' academic performance has been a research area of
interest in recent years, with many institutions focusing on improving
the students' performance and the education quality. The analysis and
prediction of students' performance can be achieved using various data
mining techniques. Moreover, such techniques allow instructors to
determine possible factors that may affect the students' final marks. To
that end, this work analyzes two different undergraduate datasets at two
different universities. Furthermore, this work aims to predict the
students' performance at two stages of course delivery (20\% and 50\%
respectively). This analysis allows for properly choosing the
appropriate machine learning algorithms to use as well as optimize the
algorithms' parameters. Furthermore, this work adopts a systematic
multi-split approach based on Gini index and p-value. This is done by
optimizing a suitable bagging ensemble learner that is built from any
combination of six potential base machine learning algorithms. It is
shown through experimental results that the posited bagging ensemble
models achieve high accuracy for the target group for both datasets.},

 abstract = {A computationally efficient artificial intelligence (AI) model called
Extreme Learning Machines (ELM) is adopted to analyze patterns embedded
in continuous assessment to model the weighted score (WS) and the
examination (EX) score in engineering mathematics courses at an
Australian regional university. The student performance data taken over
a six-year period in multiple courses ranging from the mid- to the
advanced level and a diverse course offering mode (i.e., on-campus, ONC,
and online, ONL) are modelled by ELM and further benchmarked against
competing models: random forest (RF) and Volterra. With the assessments
and examination marks as key predictors of WS (leading to a grade in the
mid-level course), ELM (with respect to RF and Volterra) outperformed
its counterpart models both for the ONC and the ONL offer. This
generated relative prediction error in the testing phase, of only
0.74\%, compared to about 3.12\% and 1.06\%, respectively, while for the
ONL offer, the prediction errors were only 0.51\% compared to about
3.05\% and 0.70\%. In modelling the student performance in advanced
engineering mathematics course, ELM registered slightly larger errors:
0.77\% (vs. 22.23\% and 1.87\%) for ONC and 0.54\% (vs. 4.08\% and
1.31\%) for the ONL offer. This study advocates a pioneer implementation
of a robust AI methodology to uncover relationships among student
learning variables, developing teaching and learning intervention and
course health checks to address issues related to graduate outcomes, and
student learning attributes in the higher education sector.},

 abstract = {Predicting students' performance is one of the important tasks in
Educational Data Mining (EDM). Early prediction can help the university
to take actions that help students to graduate on time and have the best
learning outcomes. It also helps the universities to save billions of
dollars spent on students who fail, change major or dropout. In this
paper, we report work in student performance prediction using 15
classification algorithms. The experimental results show that we were
able to predict students' final GPA with 91\% accuracy for two models
Naive Bayes and Hoeffding tree which significantly outperform
competitive models across different datasets. The average accuracy for
all the 15 classifiers was around 71\%. We also analyzed the rules
generated by tree-based and rule-based classifiers and found that some
courses at early levels can have a major effect on the final GPA. In
comparison to other works in the field, we were able to have more
comprehensive analysis that produced better accuracy with higher
variation of class values. These results show the potential for data
mining to improve students' success rate by informing who are at risk in
order for Instructors and administrators to provide the necessary
support at the right time.},

 abstract = {All educational institutions always try to investigate the learning
behaviors of students and give early prediction toward student's
outcomes for interventing and improving their learning performance.
Educational data mining ( EDM) offers various effective prediction
models to predict student performance. Simultaneously, feature selection
(FS) is a method of EDM that is utilized to determine the dominant
factors that are needed and sufficient for the target concept. FS method
extracts high-quality data that reduce the complexity of the prediction
task that can increase the robustness of decision rule. In this paper,
we provide a comparative study of feature selection methods for
determining dominant factors that highly affect classification
performance and improve the performance of prediction models. A new
feature selection CHIMI based on ranked vector score is proposed.
Analysis of feature sets of each FS method to get the dominant set is
executed. The experimental results show that by using the dominant set
of the proposed CHIMI method, the classification performance of the
proposed models is significantly improved.},

 abstract = {Student performance prediction is one of the most concerning issues in
the field of education and training, especially educational data mining.
The prediction supports students to select courses and design
appropriate study plans for themselves. Moreover, student performance
prediction enables lecturers as well as educational managers to indicate
what students should be monitored and supported to complete their
programs with the best results. These supports can reduce formal
warnings and expulsions from universities due to students' poor
performance. This study proposes a method to predict student performance
using various deep learning techniques. Also, we analyze and present
several techniques for data pre-processing (e.g., Quantile Transforms
and MinMax Scaler) before fetching them into well-known deep learning
models such as Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNN) to do prediction tasks. Experiments are built on 16
datasets related to numerous different majors with appropriately four
million samples collected from the student information system of a
Vietnamese multidisciplinary university. Results show that the proposed
method provides good prediction results, especially when using data
transformation. The results are feasible for applying to practical
cases.},

predicting poor-performing students. A comparative study of prediction
models was conducted. Subsequently, high performing models were
developed to get higher performance. The hybrid random forest named
Hybrid RF produces the most successful classification. For the context
of intervention and improving the learning outcomes, a novel feature
selection method named MICHI, which is the combination of mutual
information and chi-square algorithms based on the ranked feature scores
is introduced to select a dominant set and improve performance of
prediction models. By using the proposed techniques of educational data
mining, and academic performance prediction system is subsequently
developed for educational stockholders to get an early prediction of
student learning outcomes for timely intervention. Experimental results
and evaluation surveys report the effectiveness and usefulness of the
developed academic prediction system. The system is used to help

 abstract = {Prediction models that underlie ``early warning systems{''} need
improvement. Some predict outcomes using entrenched, unchangeable
characteristics (e.g., socioeconomic status) and others rely on
performance on early assignments to predict the final grades to which
they contribute. Behavioral predictors of learning outcomes often accrue
slowly, to the point that time needed to produce accurate predictions
leaves little time for intervention. We aimed to improve on these
methods by testing whether we could predict performance in a large
lecture course using only students' digital behaviors in weeks prior to
the first exam. Early prediction based only on malleable behaviors
provides time and opportunity to advise students on ways to alter study
and improve performance. Thereafter, we took the not-yet-common step of
applying this model and testing whether providing digital learning
support to those predicted to perform poorly can improve their
achievement. Using learning management system log data, we tested models
composed of theory-aligned behaviors using multiple algorithms and
obtained a model that accurately predicted poor grades. Our algorithm
correctly identified 75\% of students who failed to earn the grade of B
or better needed to advance to the next course. We applied this model
the next semester to predict achievement levels and provided a digital
learning strategy intervention to students predicted to perform poorly.
Those who accessed advice outperformed classmates on subsequent exams,
and more students who accessed the advice achieved the B needed to move
forward in their major than those who did not access advice.},

 abstract = {The Educational Data Mining (EDM) is a very vigorous area of Data Mining
(DM), and it is helpful in predicting the performance of students.
Student performance prediction is not only important for the student but
also helpful for academic organization to detect the causes of success
and failures of students. Furthermore, the features selected through the
students' performance prediction models helps in developing action plans
for academic welfare. Feature selection can increase the prediction
accuracy of the prediction model. In student performance prediction
model, where every feature is very important, as a neglection of any
important feature can cause the wrong development of academic action
plans. Moreover, the feature selection is a very important step in the
development of student performance prediction models. There are
different types of feature selection algorithms. In this paper, Fast
Correlation-Based Filter (FCBF) is selected as a feature selection
algorithm. This paper is a step on the way to identifying the factors
affecting the academic performance of the students. In this paper
performance of FCBF is being evaluated on three different student's
datasets. The performance of FCBF is detected well on a student dataset
with greater no of features.},

 abstract = {Student performance prediction is a fundamental task in online learning
systems, which aims to provide students with access to active learning.
Generally, student performance prediction is achieved by tracing the
evolution of each students knowledge states via a series of learning
activities. Every learning activity record has two types of feature
data: student behavior and exercise features. However, most methods use
features that are related to exercises, such as correctness and
concepts, while other student behavior features are usually ignored. The
few studies that have focused on student behavior features through
subjective manual selection argue that different student behavior
features can be used in an equivalent manner to predict student
performance. In this paper, we assume that the integration of student
behavior features and exercise features is crucial to improve the
precision of prediction, and each feature has a different impact on
student performance. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel framework
for student performance prediction by making full use of both student
behavior features and exercise features and combining the attention
mechanism with the knowledge tracing model. Specifically, we first
exploit machine learning to capture feature representation
automatically. Then, a fusion attention mechanism based on recurrent
neural network architecture is used for student performance prediction.
Extensive experiments on a real-world dataset show the effectiveness and
practicability of our approach. The accuracy of our method is up to
98\%, which is superior to previous methods.},

 abstract = {Deep learning (DL) techniques have shown good potential in building
favorable predictive models in e-learning environments. It is important
to build a DL-based, fine-grained student performance prediction model
to predict students' outcomes and learning status at every stage of
their course, rather than merely predicting the students' final score
and drop-out rate, which is referred to as coarse-grained performance.
In this paper, we tackle the problem of fine-grained student performance
prediction in an online course using DL-based long sequence generation
by formulating the students' feature as a matrix where elements in
certain parts are missing. We propose an adaptive sparse self-attention
network to generate the missing values and simultaneously predict the
fine-grained performance. The matrix representation of the features
facilitates position-wise feature selection, which helps to find the
most correlated components from the past learning stage, leading to an
embedding with both the original features and their spatial
relationships. We build a deep neural network model with several sparse
self-attention layers stacked together to achieve sequence generation.
Experimental studies on three real-world datasets from different
elearning platforms demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of our
proposed method. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

 abstract = {Knowledge states modeling is a fundamental issue in online education.
One of its tasks is to discover the potential knowledge capacity of
students for predicting their performance (i.e., scores on exercises).
Current studies either depend on cognitive diagnosis approaches or apply
collaborative filtering. However, the prediction accuracy of traditional
cognitive diagnosis is insufficient, and collaborative filtering has
difficulty ensuring the interpretability of prediction. Actually,
students usually read some auxiliary text learning materials that they
are interested in, namely, preferred learning material, to consolidate
what they have learned. Preference cognitive diagnosis means that the
preferred learning materials can reflect the students' knowledge states
(i.e., proficiency for knowledge concepts) to some extent, which is
beneficial for predicting students' performance. Therefore, we propose a
preference cognitive diagnosis method (PreferenceCD) to model students'
knowledge states. Specifically, we first design the Direct-Indirect
method to acquire students' preferred learning materials. This method
mines important information from students' reading content that can
reflect their preference for learning materials to acquire those
preferred learning materials directly. Moreover, it discovers preferred
learning materials indirectly by analyzing the similarity of students'
learning behaviors during the reading process. Subsequently, we
calculate students' preference degree for knowledge concepts based on
the acquired preferred learning materials and diagnose their proficiency
for knowledge concepts by applying a cognitive diagnosis model. After
that, we combine the above two aspects to model students' knowledge
states and further predict their scores on exercises. The experimental
results on a real-world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of
PreferenceCD with both accuracy and interpretability. The accuracy, root
mean square error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE) of PreferenceCD
are 0.7614, 0.4805, and 0.2386, respectively, which outperforms related
works by about 2-12\% in terms of these evaluation metrics.},

 abstract = {Predicting student performance for educational organizations such as
universities, community colleges, schools, and training centers will
enhance the overall results of these organizations. Big data can be
extracted from the internal systems of these organizations, such as exam
records, statistics about virtual courses, and e-learning systems.
Finding meaningful knowledge from extracted data is a challenging task.
In this paper, we proposed a modified version of Harris Hawks
Optimization (HHO) algorithm by controlling the population diversity to
overcome the early convergence problem and prevent trapping in a local
optimum. The proposed approach is employed as a feature selection
algorithm to discover the most valuable features for student performance
prediction problem. A dynamic controller that controls the population
diversity by observing the performance of HHO using the k-nearest
neighbors (kNN) algorithm as a clustering approach. Once all solutions
belong to one cluster, an injection process is employed to redistribute
the solutions over the search space. A set of machine learning
classifiers such as kNN, Layered recurrent neural network (LRNN), Naive
Bayes, and Artificial Neural Network are used to evaluate the overall
prediction system. A real dataset obtained from UCI machine learning
repository is adopted in this paper. The obtained results show the
importance of predicting students' performance at an earlier stage to
avoid students' failure and improve the overall performance of the
educational organization. Moreover, the reported results show that the
combination between the enhanced HHO and LRNN can outperform other
classifiers with accuracy equal to

The herein survey is among the first research efforts to synthesize the
intelligent models and paradigms applied in education to predict the
attainment of student learning outcomes, which represent a proxy for
student performance. The survey identifies several key challenges and
provides recommendations for future research in the field of educational
data mining.
The prediction of student academic performance has drawn considerable
attention in education. However, although the learning outcomes are
believed to improve learning and teaching, prognosticating the
attainment of student outcomes remains underexplored. A decade of
research work conducted between 2010 and November 2020 was surveyed to
present a fundamental understanding of the intelligent techniques used
for the prediction of student performance, where academic success is
strictly measured using student learning outcomes. The electronic
bibliographic databases searched include ACM, IEEE Xplore, Google
Scholar, Science Direct, Scopus, Springer, and Web of Science.
Eventually, we synthesized and analyzed a total of 62 relevant papers
with a focus on three perspectives, (1) the forms in which the learning
outcomes are predicted, (2) the predictive analytics models developed to
forecast student learning, and (3) the dominant factors impacting
student outcomes. The best practices for conducting systematic
literature reviews, e.g., PICO and PRISMA, were applied to synthesize
and report the main results. The attainment of learning outcomes was
measured mainly as performance class standings (i.e., ranks) and
achievement scores (i.e., grades). Regression and supervised machine
learning models were frequently employed to classify student
performance. Finally, student online learning activities, term
assessment grades, and student academic emotions were the most evident
predictors of learning outcomes. We conclude the survey by highlighting
some major research challenges and suggesting a summary of significant
recommendations to motivate future works in this field.},

 abstract = {Student performance prediction plays an important role in improving
education quality. Noticing that students' exercise-answering processes
exhibit different characteristics according to their different
performance levels, this paper aims to mine the performance-related
information from students' exercising logs and to explore the
possibility of predicting students' performance using such
process-characteristic information. A formal model of student-shared
exercising processes and its discovery method from students' exercising
logs are presented. Several similarity measures between students'
individual exercising behavior and student-shared exercising processes
are presented. A prediction method of students' performance level
considering these similarity measures is explored based on
classification algorithms. An experiment on real-life exercise-answering
event logs shows the effectiveness of the proposed prediction method.},

 abstract = {The current traditional college psychology courses only pay attention to
the prevention and correction of the psychological problems of college
students, but neglect to let students have a good positive emotion to
learn, which is not conducive to the development of psychological
potential of students, thus psychology learning cannot achieve the
expected results. Based on the psychology blended teaching theory,
combined with the entrepreneurial education of college students, a set
of PDCA (Plan-Do-Check-Action) teaching mode which adapts to the
development needs of ``Internet education{''} is designed, and formed
several new methods of teaching, such as ``integration of online and
offline classroom teaching{''}. In addition, a new performance
prediction model based on graph convolution neural network is proposed
decision tree data mining methods are used to predict student
performance, by extracting user information and high-dimensional
information of the knowledge graph, this mode is conducive to platform
managers to understand students' conditions in time and improve teaching
quality. This teaching mode dynamically analyzes the internal
relationships among learners, teachers, online classrooms, offline
classrooms and it can find problems early and provide solutions. It is
conducive to improving students' academic performance and learning

 abstract = {In this paper, we apply data mining techniques and machine learning
algorithms using R software, which is used to predict, here we applied a
regression model to test some factor on the dataset for which we assumed
that it effects student performance. Model was built on an existing
dataset which contains many factors and the final grades. The factors
tested are the attention to higher education, absences, study time,
parent's education level, parent's jobs, and the number of failures in
the past. The result shows that only study time and absences can affect
the students' performance. Prediction of student academic performance
helps instructors develop a good understanding of how well or how poorly
the students in their classes will perform, so instructors can take
proactive measures to improve student learning. This paper also focuses
on how the prediction algorithm can be used to identify the most
important attributes in a student's data.},

many stakeholders, including students, teachers and educational
institutes. In this domain, it is equally important to have accurate and
explainable predictions, where accuracy refers to the correctness of the
predicted value, and explainability refers to the understandability of
the prediction made. In this systematic review, we investigate
explainable models of student performance prediction from 2015 to 2020.
We analyze and synthesize primary studies, and group them based on nine
dimensions. Our analysis revealed the need for more studies on
explainable student performance prediction models, where both accuracy

 abstract = {One of the important measures of quality of education is the performance
of students in academic settings. Nowadays, abundant data is stored in
educational institutions about students which can help to discover
insight on how students are learning and to improve their performance
ahead of time using data mining techniques. In this paper, we developed
a student performance prediction model that predicts the performance of
high school students for the next semester for five courses. We modeled
our prediction system as a multi-label classification task and used
support vector machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), K-nearest Neighbors
(KNN), and Multi-layer perceptron (MLP) as base-classifiers to train our
model. We further improved the performance of the prediction model using
a state-of-the-art partitioning scheme to divide the label space into
smaller spaces and used Label Powerset (LP) transformation method to
transform each labelset into a multi-class classification task. The
proposed model achieved better performance in terms of different
evaluation metrics when compared to other multi-label learning tasks
such as binary relevance and classifier chains.},

application of statistical techniques to later use of computational
techniques. Results in this field are varied, thus, we have to take
advantage of previous research results. This study proposes a
Multi-layer Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (MANFIS) for student
performance prediction in online Higher Education settings. The MANFIS
was trained and tested using a dataset integrated by the scores obtained
by students in four online Higher Education courses. The MANFIS
prediction accuracy was compared against the accuracies of Multilayer
neural network, Radial Basis Function Neural Network, and General
Regression Neural Network. The accuracy of the MANFIS prediction
statistically outperformed at least one neural network (out of three
possible) in each dataset. The Results indicate that MANFIS is an
alternative model to predict student performance in online Higher
Education settings.},

 abstract = {Students at Saudi universities face difficulty registering for the right
course since Student performance there is no support offered to students
that uniquely consider each situation. Machine learning techniques could
be applied to fill this gap by predicting grades of new courses for each
student based on their historical data. This paper experiments with nine
different prediction algorithms to predict course grades for public
university students. The data-set includes grades for 215 students and
180 various courses. The models utilize grades obtained in semesters
between the 2015 and 2018 academic years and evaluated on grades
obtained in the 2019 academic year. Our result shows that the K-nearest
neighbor with ZScore model outperforms the remaining models with respect
to the Percentage of Tick Accuracy (PTA), which is the difference
between two consecutive letter grades for the predicted letter grade and
the observed letter grade. Our work achieved an 84\% accuracy score in
PTA2, where the difference between the predicted letter grade and the
actual letter grade is less than or equal to two consecutive letter
grades.},

 abstract = {Predicting students' learning outcomes is one of the main topics of
interest in the area of Educational Data Mining and Learning Analytics.
To this end, a plethora of machine learning methods has been
successfully applied for solving a variety of predictive problems.
However, it is of utmost importance for both educators and data
scientists to develop accurate learning models at low cost. Fuzzy logic
constitutes an appropriate approach for building models of high
performance and transparency. In addition, active learning reduces both
the time and cost of labeling effort, by exploiting a small set of
labeled data along with a large set of unlabeled data in the most
efficient way. In addition, choosing the proper method for a given
problem formulation and configuring the optimal parameter setting is a
demanding task, considering the high-dimensional input space and the
complexity of machine learning algorithms. As such, exploring the
potential of automated machine learning (autoML) strategies from the
perspective of machine learning adeptness is important. In this context,
the present study introduces a fuzzy-based active learning method for
predicting students' academic performance which combines, in a modular
way, autoML practices. A lot of experiments was carried out, revealing
the efficiency of the proposed method for the accurate prediction of
students at risk of failure. These insights may have the potential to
support the learning experience and be useful the wider science of
learning.},

 abstract = {Performance Factors Analysis (PFA) is considered one of the most
important Knowledge Tracing (KT) approaches used for constructing
adaptive educational hypermedia systems. It has shown a high prediction
accuracy against many other KT approaches. While, the desire to estimate
more accurately the student level leads researchers to enhance PFA by
inventing several advanced extensions. However, most of the proposed
extensions have exclusively been improved in a pedagogical sense, as the
improvements have mostly been limited to the analysis of students'
behaviour during their learning process. In contrast, Machine Learning
provides many powerful methods that could be efficient to enhance, in
the technical sense, the prediction of student performance. Our goal is
to focus on the exploitation of Ensemble Learning methods as an
extremely effective Machine Learning paradigm used to create many
advanced solutions in several fields. In this sense, we propose a new
PFA approach based on different models (Random Forest, AdaBoost, and
XGBoost) in order to increase the predictive accuracy of student
performance. Our models have been evaluated on three different datasets.
The experimental results show that the scalable XGBoost has outperformed
the other evaluated models and substantially improved the performance
prediction compared to the original PFA algorithm.},

 abstract = {The educational data mining researchers have achieved significant
efficiency in predicting student performance during the tenure of the
course. However, an early prediction before course commencement is still
a research challenge. Such advanced forecast can help the teachers in
providing timely assistance to uplift the academic performance of a
student, reduce the number of failures and performance degradations.
Importantly, an additional measure of prediction confidence can be
useful in this regard to decide the magnitude of the assistance
required. The primary objective of this study is to predict the failure,
degradation and improvement before course commencement. A real dataset
containing nearly 0.6 million records is used here for this purpose. We
have initially applied multiple state-of-the-art classifiers on this
dataset to predict the performance in binary terms. Unfortunately, these
classifiers could not perform well, and they are unable to provide the
desired prediction confidence as well. We have therefore proposed a
novel scalable algorithm, named random wheel, for classification. It not
only works efficiently on this dataset but also works well with other
benchmarked datasets. The proposed classifier provides an additional
measure to indicate the prediction confidence. It, in turn, increases
the acceptability of the prediction.},

 abstract = {Aim/Purpose This research aims to present a brand-new approach for
student performance prediction using the Learning Fuzzy Cognitive Map
(LFCM) approach.
Background Predicting student academic performance has long been an
important research topic in many academic disciplines. Different
mathematical models have been employed to predict student performance.
Although the available sets of common prediction approaches, such as
Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) and regression, work well with large
datasets, they face challenges dealing with small sample sizes, limiting
their practical applications in real practices.
Methodology Six distinct categories of performance antecedents are
adopted here as course characteristics, LMS characteristics, student
characteristics, student engagement, student support, and institutional
factors, along with measurement items within each category. Furthermore,
we assessed the student's overall performance using three items of
student satisfaction score, knowledge construction level, and student
GPA. We have collected longitudinal data from 30 postgraduates in four
subsequent semesters and analyzed data using the Learning Fuzzy
Cognitive Map (LFCM) technique.
Contribution This research proposes a brand new approach, Learning Fuzzy
Cognitive Map (LFCM), to predict student performance. Using this
approach, we identified the most influential determinants of student
performance, such as student engagement. Besides, this research depicts
a model of interrelations among the student performance determinants.
Findings The results suggest that the model reasonably predicts the
incoming sequence when there is a limited sample size. The results also
reveal that students' total online time and the regularity of learning
interval in LMS have the largest effect on overall performance. The
student engagement category also has the highest direct effect on
student's overall performance.
Recommendations Academic institutions can use the results and approach
developed in this paper for Practitioners to identify students'
performance antecedents, predict the performance, and establish action
plans to resolve the shortcomings in the long term. Instructors can
adjust their learning methods based on the feedback from students in the
short run on the operational level.
Recommendations Researchers can use the proposed approach in this
research to deal with the for Researchers problems in other domains,
such as using LMS for organizational/institutional education. Besides,
they can focus on specific dimensions of the proposed model, such as
exploring ways to boost student engagement in the learning process.
Impact on Society Our results revealed that students are at the center
of the learning process. The degree to which they are dedicated to
learning is the most crucial determinant of the learning outcome.
Therefore, learners should consider this finding in order the gain value
from the learning process.
Future Research As a potential for future works, the proposed approach
could be used in other contexts to test its applicability. Future
studies could also improve the performance level of the proposed LFMC
model by tuning the model's elements.},

 abstract = {Educational Data Science has meant an important advancement in the
understanding and improvemen of learning models in recent years. One of
the most relevant research topics is student performance prediction
through click-stream activity in virtual learning environments, which
provide abundant information about their behaviour during the course.
This work explores the potential of Deep Learning and Meta-Learning in
this field, which has thus far been explored very little, so that it can
serve as a basis for future studies. We implemented a predictive model
which is able to automatically optimise the architecture and
hyperparameters of a deep neural network, taking as a use case an
educational dataset that contains information from more than 500
students from an online university master's degree. The results show
that the performance of the autonomous model was similar to the
traditionally designed one, which offers significant benefits in terms
of efficiency and scalability. This also opens up interesting areas of
research related to Meta-Learning applied to educational Big Data.},

 abstract = {In order to improve the effect of college student performance
prediction, based on machine learning and neural network algorithms,
this paper improves the traditional data processing algorithms and
proposes a similarity calculation method for courses. Moreover, this
paper uses cosine similarity to calculate the similarity of courses.
Simultaneously, this paper proposes an improved hybrid multi-weight
improvement algorithm to improve the cold start problem that cannot be
solved by traditional algorithms. In addition, this paper combines the
neural network structure to construct a model framework structure, sets
the functional modules according to actual needs, and analyzes and
predicts students' personal performance through student portraits.
Finally, this paper designs experiments to analyze the effectiveness of
the model proposed in this paper. From the experimental data, it can be
seen that the model proposed in this paper basically meets the expected
requirements.},

 abstract = {While the recent technological advancements have enabled instructors to
deliver mathematical concepts and theories beyond the physical
boundaries innovatively and interactively, poor performance and low
success rate in mathematic courses have always been a major concern of
educators. More specifically, in an online learning environment, where
students are not physically present in the classroom and access course
materials over the network, it is toilsome for course coordinators to
track and monitor every student's academic learning and experiences.
Thus, automated student performance monitoring is indispensable since it
is easy for online students, especially those underperforming, to be
``out of sight,{''} hence getting derailed and off-track. Since student
learning and performance are evolving over time, it is reasonable to
consider student performance monitoring as a time-series problem and
implement a time-series predictive model to forecast students'
educational progress and achievement. This research paper presents a
case study from a higher education institute where interaction data and
course achievement of a previously offered online course are used to
develop a time-series predictive model using a Long Short-Term Memory
network, a special kind of Recurrent Neural Network architecture. The
proposed model makes predictions of student status at any given time of
the semester by examining the trend or pattern learned in the previous
events. The model reported an average classification accuracy of 86 and
84\% with the training dataset and testing dataset, respectively. The
proposed model is trialed on selected online math courses with exciting
yet dissimilar trends recorded.},

 abstract = {Predicting student performance as early as possible and analysing to
which extent initial student behaviour could lead to failure or success
is critical in introductory programming (CS1) courses, for allowing
prompt intervention in a move towards alleviating their high failure
rate. However, in CS1 performance prediction, there is a serious lack of
studies that interpret the predictive model's decisions. In this sense,
we designed a long-term study using very fine-grained log-data of 2056
students, collected from the first two weeks of CS1 courses. We extract
features that measure how students deal with deadlines, how they fix
errors, how much time they spend programming, and so forth.
Subsequently, we construct a predictive model that achieved cutting-edge
results with area under the curve (AUC) of.89, and an average accuracy
of 81.3\%. To allow an effective intervention and to facilitate human-AI
collaboration towards prescriptive analytics, we, for the first time, to
the best of our knowledge, go a step further than the prediction itself
and leverage this field by proposing an approach to explaining our
predictive model decisions individually and collectively using a
game-theory based framework (SHAP), (Lundberg et al., 2020) that allows
interpreting our black-box non-linear model linearly. In other words, we
explain the feature effects, clearly by visualising and analysing
individual predictions, the overall importance of features, and
identification of typical prediction paths. This method can be further
applied to other emerging competitive models, as the CS1 prediction
field progresses, ensuring transparency of the process for key
stakeholders: administrators, teachers, and students.},

 abstract = {The new students struggle to understand the introductory programming
courses, due to its intricate nature, which results in higher dropout
and increased failure rates. Despite implementing productive
methodologies, the instructor struggles to identify the students with
distinctive levels of skills. The modern institutes are looking for
technology-equipped practices to classify the students and prepare
personalized consultation procedures for each class. This paper applies
decision tree-based machine learning classifiers to develop a prediction
model competent to forecast the outcome of the introductory programming
students at an early stage of the semester. The model is then
transformed into an adaptive consultation framework which generates
three types of colored signals; red, yellow, and green which illustrates
whether the student is performing low, average, or high respectively.
This provides an opportunity for the instructor to set precautionary
measures for low performing students and set complicated tasks that help
the highly skilled students to improve their skills further. The
experiments compare a set of decision tree-based classifiers and
conclude J48 as an efficient model in classifying students in all
classes with high accuracy, sensitivity, and F-measure. Even though the
aim of the research is to focus on introductory programming courses,
however, the framework is flexible and can be implemented in other
courses.},

 abstract = {Educational data generated through various platforms such as e-learning,
e-admission systems, and automated result management systems can be
effectively processed through educational data mining techniques in
order to gather highly useful insights into students' performance. The
prediction of student performance from historical academic data is a
highly desirable application of educational data mining. In this regard,
there is an urgent need to develop an automated technique for student
performance prediction. Existing studies on student performance
prediction primarily focus on utilizing the conventional feature
representation schemes, where extracted features are fed to a
classifier. In recent years, deep learning has enabled researchers to
automatically extract high-level features from raw data. Such advanced
feature representation schemes enable superior performance in
challenging tasks. In this work, we examine the deep neural network
model, namely, the attention-based Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory
(BiLSTM) network to efficiently predict student performance (grades)
from historical data. In this article, we have used the most advanced
BiLSTM combined with an attention mechanism model by analyzing existing
research problems, which are based on advanced feature classification
and prediction. This work is really vital for academicians,
universities, and government departments to early predict the
performance. The superior sequence learning capabilities of BiLSTM
combined with attention mechanism yield superior performance compared to
the existing state-of-the-art. The proposed method has achieved a
prediction accuracy of 90.16\%.},

 abstract = {A major problem an instructor experiences is the systematic monitoring
of students' academic progress in a course. The moment the students,
with unsatisfactory academic progress, are identified the instructor can
take measures to offer additional support to the struggling students.
The fact is that the modern-day educational institutes tend to collect
enormous amount of data concerning their students from various sources,
however, the institutes are craving novel procedures to utilize the data
to magnify their prestige and improve the education quality. This
research evaluates the effectiveness of machine learning algorithms to
monitor students' academic progress and informs the instructor about the
students at the risk of ending up with unsatisfactory result in a
course. In addition, the prediction model is transformed into a clear
shape to make it easy for the instructor to prepare the necessary
precautionary procedures. We developed a set of prediction models with
distinct machine learning algorithms. Decision tree triumph over other
models and thus is further transformed into easily explicable format.
The final output of the research turns into a set of supportive measures
to carefully monitor students' performance from the very start of the
course and a set of preventive measures to offer additional attention to
the struggling students.},

 abstract = {Next-term grade prediction is a challenging problem. The objective of
this problem is to predict students grades in new courses, given their
grades in courses they have previously taken. Adopting various machine
learning algorithms is a very common and straightforward approach to
tackling this problem. However, such models are very difficult to
interpret. That is, it is difficult to explain to a student (or a
teacher) why the model predicted grade B for a given student for
example. In this work, we shed light on the importance of building
interpretable models for educational data mining tasks. Specifically, we
propose a novel interpretable framework for multi-class grade prediction
that is based on an optimal rule-list mining algorithm. Additionally, we
evaluate our proposed framework on two private datasets and compare our
results with baseline models. Our findings show that our proposed
framework is capable of achieving higher prediction and interpretability
values when compared to black-box models.},

 abstract = {The educational data mining (EDM) can be specified as one of the main
fields related to high-quality research that involves mining datasets to
address research questions related to education; such questions examine
the ways in which people learn and teach. a large amount of data,
including education data, are being collected, and much of them are
unprocessed. The success of EDM was examined in this paper, and nine
data mining techniques were explored including: bagging, multilayer
perception (MLP), naive Bayes (NB), K-nearest neighbours (KNN), logistic
regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), XGBoost, decision tree
(DT), and random forest (RF). Such techniques were used on an
educational dataset obtained from certain learning management system
which is referred to as Kalboard 360. This paper involves three major
steps. Firstly, student performance model that contains exceptional
feature's category, that are referred to as behavioural features, is
introduced. Secondly, the dataset is pre-processed, and the
pre-processing steps involve transforming the raw data into a usable
format and verifying the connections between independent and dependent
variables in sample dataset, which has been also referred to as the
training dataset. Thirdly, the nine data mining approaches have been
utilized on the acquired dataset to classify student performance into
low, middle, and high levels. Afterwards, the performance measures were
examined by using recall, precision, accuracy, as well as F1 score. RF
(89\%) obtained the best accuracy also other techniques were ordered in
terms of accuracy: bagging (85\%) > XGBoost 84\% > NB (81\%) > LR (81\%)
> MLP (77\%) > DT (76\%) > SVM (72\%) > KNN (68\%). Results were
compared by using divided datasets (80:20 ratio) (80 for training: 20
for testing).},

environment by contributing state-of-the-art methods, techniques, and

understanding the student learning environment by exploring and
utilizing educational data using machine learning and data mining
techniques. Modern academic institutions operate in a highly competitive
and complex environment. Analyzing performance, providing high-quality
education, strategies for evaluating the students' performance, and
future actions are among the prevailing challenges universities face.
Student intervention plans must be implemented in these universities to
overcome problems experienced by the students during their studies. In
this systematic review, the relevant EDM literature related to
identifying student dropouts and students at risk from 2009 to 2021 is
reviewed. The review results indicated that various Machine Learning
(ML) techniques are used to understand and overcome the underlying
challenges; predicting students at risk and students drop out
prediction. Moreover, most studies use two types of datasets: data from
student colleges/university databases and online learning platforms. ML
methods were confirmed to play essential roles in predicting students at
risk and dropout rates, thus improving the students' performance.},

 abstract = {Predicting academic performance is a key element in education, allowing
teachers to design preventive didactic actions. Various computational
disciplines are involved in this predictive process, with learning
analytics, machine learning, educational data mining, artificial neural
networks, and fuzzy theories being the most frequently used. A
systematic review of the scientific literature (2010-March 2020) indexed
in Scopus, IEEE Xplore, ACM Digital Library and Springer is presented,
with the aim of evaluating how academic performance prediction has
behaved in two scenarios: (1) studies online (online) and blended; and
(2) technological support for the face-to-face modality. The article
concludes with the determination of the trends between the disciplines
of educational technologies and the variables of academic performance.},

 abstract = {In recent times, Educational Data Mining and Learning Analytics have
been abundantly used to model decision-making to improve
teaching/learning ecosystems. However, the adaptation of student models
in different domains/courses needs a balance between the generalization
and context specificity to reduce the redundancy in creating
domain-specific models. This paper explores the predictive power and
generalization of a feature - context-bound cognitive skill score- in
estimating the likelihood of success or failure of a student in a
traditional higher education course so that the appropriate intervention
is provided to help the students. To identify the students at risk in
different courses, we applied classification algorithms on context-bound
cognitive skill scores of a student to estimate the chances of success
or failure, especially failure. The context-bound cognitive skill scores
were aggregated based on the learning objective of a course to generate
meaningful visual feedback to teachers and students so that they can
understand why some students are predicted to be at risk. Evaluation of
the generated model shows that this feature is applicable in a range of
courses, and it mitigates the effort in engineering features/models for
each domain. We submit that overall, context-bound cognitive skill
scores prove to be effective in flagging the student performance when
the accurate metrics related to learning activities and social behaviors
of the students are unavailable.},

 abstract = {Student performance prediction helps the educational stakeholders to
take proactive decisions and make interventions, for the improvement of
quality of education and to meet the dynamic needs of society. The
selection of features for student's performance prediction not only
plays significant role in increasing prediction accuracy, but also helps
in building the strategic plans for the improvement of students'
academic performance. There are different feature selection algorithms
for predicting the performance of students, however the studies reported
in the literature claim that there are different pros and cons of
existing feature selection algorithms in selection of optimal features.
In this paper, a hybrid feature selection framework (using
feature-fusion) is designed to identify the significant features and
associated features with target class, to predict the performance of
students. The main goal of the proposed hybrid feature selection is not
only to improve the prediction accuracy, but also to identify optimal
features for building productive strategies for the improvement in
students' academic performance. The key difference between proposed
hybrid feature selection framework and existing hybrid feature selection
framework, is two level feature fusion technique, with the utilization
of cosine-based fusion. Whereas, according to the results reported in
existing literature, cosine similarity is considered as the best
similarity measure among existing similarity measures. The proposed
hybrid feature selection is validated on four benchmark datasets with
variations in number of features and number of instances. The validated
results confirm that the proposed hybrid feature selection framework
performs better than the existing hybrid feature selection framework,
existing feature selection algorithms in terms of accuracy, f-measure,
recall, and precision. Results reported in presented paper show that the
proposed approach gives more than 90\% accuracy on benchmark dataset
that is better than the results of existing approach.},

 abstract = {The university curriculum is a systematic and organic study complex with
some immediate associated steps; the initial learning of each semester's
course is crucial, and significantly impacts the learning process of
subsequent courses and further studies. However, the low teacher-student
ratio makes it difficult for teachers to consistently follow up on the
detail-oriented learning situation of individual students. The extant
learning early warning system is committed to automatically detecting
whether students have potential difficulties-or even the risk of
failing, or non-pass reports-before starting the course. Previous
related research has the following three problems: first of all, it
mainly focused on e-learning platforms and relied on online activity
data, which was not suitable for traditional teaching scenarios;
secondly, most current methods can only proffer predictions when the
course is in progress, or even approaching the end; thirdly, few studies
have focused on the feature redundancy in these learning data. Aiming at
the traditional classroom teaching scenario, this paper transforms the
pre-class student performance prediction problem into a multi-label
learning model, and uses the attribute reduction method to
scientifically streamline the characteristic information of the courses
taken and explore the important relationship between the characteristics
of the previously learned courses and the attributes of the courses to
be taken, in order to detect high-risk students in each course before
the course begins. Extensive experiments were conducted on 10 real-world
datasets, and the results proved that the proposed approach achieves
better performance than most other advanced methods in multi-label
classification evaluation metrics.</p>},

 abstract = {The students' performance prediction (SPP) problem is a challenging
problem that managers face at any institution. Collecting educational
quantitative and qualitative data from many resources such as exam
centers, virtual courses, e-learning educational systems, and other
resources is not a simple task. Even after collecting data, we might
face imbalanced data, missing data, biased data, and different data
types such as strings, numbers, and letters. One of the most common
challenges in this area is the large number of attributes (features).
Determining the highly valuable features is needed to improve the
overall students' performance. This paper proposes an evolutionary-based
SPP model utilizing an enhanced form of the Whale Optimization Algorithm
(EWOA) as a wrapper feature selection to keep the most informative
features and enhance the prediction quality. The proposed EWOA combines
the Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA) with Sine Cosine Algorithm (SCA)
and Logistic Chaotic Map (LCM) to improve the overall performance of
WOA. The SCA will empower the exploitation process inside WOA and
minimize the probability of being stuck in local optima. The main idea
is to enhance the worst half of the population in WOA using SCA.
Besides, LCM strategy is employed to control the population diversity
and improve the exploration process. As such, we handled the imbalanced
data using the Adaptive Synthetic (ADASYN) sampling technique and
converting WOA to binary variant employing transfer functions (TFs) that
belong to different families (S-shaped and V-shaped). Two real
educational datasets are used, and five different classifiers are
employed: the Decision Trees (DT), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Naive
Bayes (NB), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and LogitBoost (LB). The
obtained results show that the LDA classifier is the most reliable
classifier with both datasets. In addition, the proposed EWOA
outperforms other methods in the literature as wrapper feature selection
with selected transfer functions.</p>},

 abstract = {Studies on the prediction of student success in distance learning have
explored mainly demographics factors and student interactions with the
virtual learning environments. However, it is remarkable that a very
limited number of studies use information about the assignments
submitted by students as influential factor to predict their academic
achievement. This paper aims to explore the real importance of
assignment information for solving students' performance prediction in
distance learning and evaluate the beneficial effect of including this
information. We investigate and compare this factor and its potential
from two information representation approaches: the traditional
representation based on single instances and a more flexible
representation based on Multiple Instance Learning (MIL), focus on
handle weakly labeled data. A comparative study is carried out using the
Open University Learning Analytics dataset, one of the most important
public datasets in education provided by one of the greatest online
universities of United Kingdom. The study includes a wide set of
different types of machine learning algorithms addressed from the two
data representation commented, showing that algorithms using only
information about assignments with a representation based on MIL can
outperform more than 20\% the accuracy with respect to a representation
based on single instance learning. Thus, it is concluded that applying
an appropriate representation that eliminates the sparseness of data
allows to show the relevance of a factor, such as the assignments
submitted, not widely used to date to predict students' academic
performance. Moreover, a comparison with previous works on the same
dataset and problem shows that predictive models based on MIL using only
assignments information obtain competitive results compared to previous
studies that include other factors to predict students performance.},

 abstract = {In several areas, including education, the use of machine learning, such
as artificial neural networks, has resulted in significant improvements
in predicting tasks. The opacity of these models is one of the problems
with their use. Prediction models that may offer valuable insights while
still being simple to comprehend are preferred by decision-makers in
education. Hence, this study suggests an approach that improves the
previous student performance prediction by enhancing performance and
explaining why a student's performance is attaining a certain score. A
prediction model was proposed and tested using machine learning models.
Our models outperform previous work models developed on the same
dataset. Using a combined framework of data level and algorithm
approaches, the proposed model achieves an accuracy of over 98\%,
inplying a 20.3\% improvement compared with previous work models. As a
balancing technique for upsampling data, we use the default strategy of
synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) to oversample all
classes to the number of examples in the majority class. We also use
ensemble methods. For tuning the parameters, we use a simple grid search
algorithm provided by scikit to estimate the optimal parameters of our
model. This hyperparameter optimization along with a ten-fold
cross-validation process demonstrates the dependability of the novel
model. In addition, a novel visual and intuitive technique is used to
help determine which factors most influence the score which helps to
interpret and understand the entire model and visualizes feature
attributions at the observation level for the machine learning model.
Therefore, SHAP values are a powerful tool that should be incorporated
within the student performance prediction framework by obtaining the
prediction and explanation created through the experiment, educators can
recognize students at risk early and provide suitable exhortation in an

 abstract = {The main aim of an educational institute is to offer high-quality
education to students. The system to achieve better quality in the
educational system is to find the knowledge from educational data and to
discover the attributes that manipulate the performance of students.
Student performance prediction is a major issue in education and
training, specifically in the educational data mining system. This
research presents the student performance prediction approach with the
MapReduce framework based on the proposed fractional competitive
multi-verse optimization-based deep neuro-fuzzy network. The proposed
fractional competitive multi-verse optimization-based deep neuro-fuzzy
network is derived by integrating fractional calculus with competitive
multi-verse optimization. The MapReduce framework is designed with the
mapper and the reducer phase to perform the student performance
prediction mechanism with the deep learning classifier. The input data
is partitioned at the mapper phase to perform the data transformation
process, and thereby the features are selected using the distance
measure. The selected unique features are employed for the data
segmentation process, and thereafter the prediction strategy is
accomplished at the reducer phase by the deep neuro-fuzzy network
classifier. The proposed method obtained the performance in terms of
mean square error, root mean square error and mean absolute error with
the values of 0.338 3, 0.581 7, and 0.391 5, respectively.},

 abstract = {Monitoring individual student academic performance is indispensable to
educational institutes since they are required to provide evidence of
their students' academic performance to diverse governmental bureaus.
Machine learning classifiers appear productive tools for this purpose;
however, instance-based machine learning classifiers have acquired the
least consideration. This research measures the suitability of
instance-based classifiers, exclusively k-Nearest Neighbours (k-NN) and
Locally Weighted Learning (LWL), in the pedagogical environment and
proposes solutions to issues related to this class of classifiers. The
performance of these classifiers depends upon the number of nearest
neighbours (k) and the distance metrics. We performed experiments, with
varying values of k and different distance metrics, to evaluate the
performance of k-NN and LWL. To authenticate the conclusions drawn from
these experiments, we carried out experimental evaluation with 3 more
datasets taken from another research. This comparison evidences the
suitability of instancebased classifiers, in pedagogical environment,
especially LWL which is one of the least addressed classifiers. The
comparative analysis highlights the fact that varying value of k and
changing the distance metric optimistically affect the classifier's
performance. Even though Manhattan distance metric dominates in
achieving higher accuracy; however, classifiers may act differently for
dissimilar datasets. To resolve this shortfall, we propose a novel
framework which carries out extensive experiments with varying value of
k and changing distance metrics and conclude a prediction model which
emerges appropriate for the provided training dataset. The framework
takes training dataset from an instructor and recommends suitable
instance-based learning prediction model.},

 abstract = {Improving the quality, developing and implementing systems that can
provide advantages to students, and predicting students' success during
the term, at the end of the term, or in the future are some of the
primary aims of education. Due to its unique ability to create
relationships and obtain accurate results, artificial intelligence and
machine learning are tools used in this field to achieve the expected
goals. However, the diversity of studies and the differences in their
content create confusion and reduce their ability to pioneer future
studies. In this study, we performed a systematic literature review of
student performance prediction studies in three different databases
between 2010 and 2020. The results are presented as percentages by
categorizing them as either model, dataset, validation, evaluation, or
aims. The common points and differences in the studies are determined,
and critical gaps and possible remedies are presented. The results and
identified gaps could be eliminated with standardized evaluation and
validation strategies. It is determined that student performance
prediction studies should be more frequently focused on deep learning
models in the future. Finally, the problems that can be solved using a
global dataset created by a global education information consortium, as
well as its advantages, are presented.},

 abstract = {Students' performance prediction systems play a vital role in enhancing
the educational performance inside universities, schools, and training
centers. Big data can come from different resources such as examination
centers, virtual courses, registration departments, e-learning systems.
Extracting meaningful knowledge from educational data is a complex task,
so reducing the data dimensionality is needed. In this paper, we
proposed an enhanced binary genetic algorithm (EBGA) as a wrapper
feature selection algorithm. Novel hybrid selection mechanism based on a
k-means algorithm and electromagnetic-like mechanism (EM) method is
proposed. K-means will cluster the population into a set of clusters,
while EM will determine a value called a total force (TF) for each
solution. Each cluster has an accumulated total force (ATF) (i.e.,
adding all TFs together). Selection process will select two solutions
with the highest TF from the cluster, which has the highest ATF. We
employed a hybrid machine learning approach between the proposed EBGA
and five different classifiers (i.e., k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN),
Decision Trees (DT), Naive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and
Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)). Two real case studies obtained from
UCI Machine Learning Repository are used in this paper. Obtained results
showed the ability of the proposed approach to enhance the performance
of the binary genetic algorithm. Moreover, the performances of all
classifiers are improved between 1\% and 11\%.},

 abstract = {Planning course study is critical to facilitate strategic intervention
in education. As a significant basis of planning course study, student
performance prediction aims to utilize students existing relevant
information to predict their future learning performance including
course grades, course failure, grade point average, etc. We target
course grade prediction for course study planning, provide reminders for
students' learning and teachers' teaching. A student's performance is
usually influenced by a variety of factors, such as the difficulty of
the test, personal performance, and learning conditions. Recent studies
focus on the various factors that influence student performance.
However, most of them ignore the differences in the impact of these
factors on different students. Moreover, existing prediction models pay
less attention to the impact of test complexity on students'
performance. To tackle these problems, we propose a novel
Complexity-based Attentive Interactive Student Performance prediction
model (CAISP) for personalized course study planning. In CAISP, the
individual differences among students can be considered by assigning
dynamically different importance using attention network to facilitate
personalized planning. Especially, to effectively alleviate the student
performance bias caused by test complexity, we fuse test complexity
features to enhance the ability of feature representation via deep
neural networks. Meanwhile, we combine factorization machines to develop
a deep joint representation based on interaction learning and further
boost the correlation between features, leading to optimal prediction
results. Extensive experiments on two real-world datasets show that
CAISP outperforms the state-of-the-art solutions.},

 abstract = {Student performance prediction (SPP) aims to evaluate the grade that a
student will reach before enrolling in a course or taking an exam. This
prediction problem is a kernel task toward personalized education and
has attracted increasing attention in the field of artificial
intelligence and educational data mining (EDM). This paper provides a
systematic review of the SPP study from the perspective of machine
learning and data mining. This review partitions SPP into five stages,
i.e., data collection, problem formalization, model, prediction, and
application. To have an intuition on these involved methods, we
conducted experiments on a data set from our institute and a public data
set. Our educational dataset composed of 1,325 students, and 832 courses
was collected from the information system, which represents a typical
higher education in China. With the experimental results, discussions on
current shortcomings and interesting future works are finally summarized
from data collections to practices. This work provides developments and
challenges in the study task of SPP and facilitates the progress of
personalized education.},

 abstract = {In the past few years, educational data mining (EDM) has attracted the
attention of researchers to enhance the quality of education. Predicting
student academic performance is crucial to improving the value of
education. Some research studies have been conducted which mainly
focused on prediction of students' performance at higher education.
However, research related to performance prediction at the secondary
level is scarce, whereas the secondary level tends to be a benchmark to
describe students' learning progress at further educational levels.
Students' failure or poor grades at lower secondary negatively impact
them at the higher secondary level. Therefore, early prediction of
performance is vital to keep students on a progressive track. This
research intended to determine the critical factors that affect the
performance of students at the secondary level and to build an efficient
classification model through the fusion of single and ensemble-based
classifiers for the prediction of academic performance. Firstly, three
single classifiers including a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), J48, and
PART were observed along with three well-established ensemble algorithms
encompassing Bagging (BAG), MultiBoost (MB), and Voting (VT)
independently. To further enhance the performance of the abovementioned
classifiers, nine other models were developed by the fusion of single
and ensemble-based classifiers. The evaluation results showed that
MultiBoost with MLP outperformed the others by achieving 98.7\%
accuracy, 98.6\% precision, recall, and F-score. The study implies that
the proposed model could be useful in identifying the academic
performance of secondary level students at an early stage to improve the
learning outcomes.},

store vast data to help identify students' performance and engagement.
As a result, researchers have been focusing their efforts on assisting
educational institutions in providing machine learning models to predict
at-risk students and to improve their performance. However, it requires
an efficient approach to construct a model that can ultimately provide
accurate predictions. Consequently, this study proposed a hybrid machine
learning framework to predict students' performance using eight
classification algorithms and three ensemble methods (Bagging, Boosting,
Voting) to determine the best-performing predictive model. In addition,
this study used filter-based and wrapper-based feature selection
techniques to select the best features of the dataset related to
students' performance. The obtained results reveal that the ensemble
methods recorded higher predictive accuracy when compared to single
classifiers. Furthermore, the accuracy of the models improved due to the
feature selection techniques utilized in this study.},

 abstract = {Predicting students' performance during their years of academic study
has been investigated tremendously. It offers important insights that
can help and guide institutions to make timely decisions and changes
leading to better student outcome achievements. In the post-COVID-19
pandemic era, the adoption of e-learning has gained momentum and has
increased the availability of online related learning data. This has
encouraged researchers to develop machine learning (ML)-based models to
predict students' performance during online classes. The study presented
in this paper, focuses on predicting student performance during a series
of online interactive sessions by considering a dataset collected using
digital electronics education and design suite. The dataset tracks the
interaction of students during online lab work in terms of text editing,
a number of keystrokes, time spent in each activity, etc., along with
the exam score achieved per session. Our proposed prediction model
consists of extracting a total of 86 novel statistical features, which
were semantically categorized in three broad categories based on
different criteria: (1) activity type, (2) timing statistics, and (3)
peripheral activity count. This set of features were further reduced
during the feature selection phase and only influential features were
retained for training purposes. Our proposed ML model aims to predict
whether a student's performance will be low or high. Five popular
classifiers were used in our study, namely: random forest (RF), support
vector machine, Naive Bayes, logistic regression, and multilayer
perceptron. We evaluated our model under three different scenarios: (1)
80:20 random data split for training and testing, (2) fivefold
cross-validation, and (3) train the model on all sessions but one which
will be used for testing. Results showed that our model achieved the
best classification accuracy performance of 97.4\% with the RF
classifier. We demonstrated that, under similar experimental setup, our
model outperformed other existing studies.},

 abstract = {Educational data mining is a process that aims at discovering patterns
that provide insight into teaching and learning processes. This work
uses Machine Learning techniques to create a student performance
prediction model, using academic data and records from a Learning
Management System, that correlates with success or failure in completing
the course. Six algorithms were employed, with models trained at three
different stages of their two-year course completion. We tested the
models with records of 394 students from 3 courses. Random Forest
provided the best results with 84.47\% on the F1 score in our
experiments, followed by Decision Tree obtaining similar results in the
first subjects. We also employ clustering techniques and find different
behavior groups with a strong correlation to performance. This work
contributes to predicting students at risk of dropping out, offers
insight into understanding student behavior, and provides a support
mechanism for academic managers to take corrective and preventive
actions on this problem.},

 abstract = {Educational institutions are creating a considerable amount of data
regarding students, faculty and related organs. This data is an
essential asset for academic institutions as it has valuable insights,
knowledge and intelligence for the policymakers. Students are the
fundamental entities and primary source of data creation in any
educational environment. The educational institutions need to
distinguish students who are weak in their studies and require special
attention and monitoring to improve their learning behaviours, future
academic performances and factors that can affect their interpretation.
This paper adopted a hybrid classification model using Decision tree and
support vector machine (SVM) algorithms to predict students' academic
performance. We statistically analyzed and identified factors that can
affect students' academic performance. The dataset used is collected
from Bachelor students of the City University of Science and Information
Technology (CUSIT). The experimental results revealed 71.79\%, 74.04\%
and 78.85\% for decision tree, and 69.87\%, 74.04\% and 71.15\% accuracy
for SVM models respectively for different splits. The study identified
seven different factors that can directly affect the students'
performance associated with educational institutions and social
networks. Factors like ``time spent on social networks,{''} ``type of
games playing on mobiles,{''} and ``time spent on playing mobile
games{''} significantly affect students' performance.},

 abstract = {This systematic literature review aims to identify the recent research
trend, most studied factors, and methods used to predict student
academic performance from 2015 to 2021. The PRISMA framework guides the
study. The study reviews 58 out of 219 research articles from Lens and
Scopus databases. The findings indicate that the research focus of
current studies revolves around identifying factors influencing student
performance, data mining (DM) algorithms performance, and DM related to
e-Learning systems. It also reveals that student academic records and
demographics are primary aspects that affect student performance. The
most used DM approach is classification and the Decision Tree classifier
is the most employed DM algorithm.},

 abstract = {As education is an essential enabler in achieving Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs), it should ``ensure inclusive, equitable
quality education, and promote lifelong learning opportunities for
all{''}. One of the frameworks for SDG 4 is to propose the concepts of
``equitable quality education{''}. To attain and work in the context of
SDG 4, artificial intelligence (AI) is a booming technology, which is
gaining interest in understanding student behavior and assessing student
performance. AI holds great potential for improving education as it has
started to develop innovative teaching and learning approaches in
education to create better learning. To provide better education, data
analytics is critical. AI and machine learning approaches provide rapid
solutions with high accuracy. This paper presents an AI-based analytics
tool created to predict student performance in a first-year Information
Technology literacy course at The University of the South Pacific (USP).
A Random Forest based classification model was developed which predicted
the performance of the student in week 6 with an accuracy value of
97.03\%, sensitivity value of 95.26\%, specificity value of 98.8\%,
precision value of 98.86\%, Matthews correlation coefficient value of
94\% and Area Under the ROC Curve value of 99\%. Hence, such a method is
very useful in predicting student performance early in their courses of
allowing for early intervention. During the COVID-19 outbreak, the
experimental findings demonstrate that the suggested prediction model
satisfies the required accuracy, precision, and recall factors for
forecasting the behavioural elements of teaching and e-learning for
students in virtual education systems.},

 abstract = {In every educational institution, predicting pupils' performance is a
vital responsibility. Due to this, a variety of data mining techniques,
such as clustering, classification, and regression, are applied to
anticipate the learner's study behavior. By Machine Learning's arrival,
it has become vital to forecast students' academic achievement, and this
study attracts significant attention within the scientific community. In
addition, the findings from this work have tremendous socio-economic
consequences. One area of major research in the world of education today
is educational data mining, which is the study of techniques to reveal
hidden patterns in educational data. Data mining strategies succeed or
fail to depend on the type and quality of the data that is being minexl.
Here, we provide a novel method that enhances the accuracy of prior
student performance prediction by identifying and providing an
explanation as to why it is rising. Using our robust machine learning
ensemble models, we propose and evaluate a prediction model. The
findings demonstrate that our CatBoost - an ensemble machine learning
model - is superior to standard machine learning models with an accuracy
of 92.27\%. This new model was able to show itself to be dependable by
the use of smote and hyperparameter optimization, which proved to be
valuable methods and approaches. Additional features are significant as
well. More critically, a unique method is utilized to increase model
transparency. The SHAD values are a valuable part of the student
performance prediction system, which we think should be integrated. For
those educators tasked with using prediction models in education, we
have found that there is a preference for models that offer both
insightful insights and easy to understand predictions, as by utilizing
our experiment the educator will be able to identify those students who
are at early risk and inspire and encourage those students in a positive
way.},

 abstract = {Student performance prediction is extremely important in today's
educational system. Predicting student achievement in advance can assist
students and teachers in keeping track of the student's progress. Today,
several institutes have implemented a manual ongoing evaluation method.
Students benefit from such methods since they help them improve their
performance. In this study, we can use educational data mining (EDM),
which we recommend as an ensemble classifier to anticipate the
understudy accomplishment forecast model based on data mining techniques
as classification techniques. This model uses distinct datasets which
represent the student's intercommunication with the instructive model.
The exhibition of an understudy's prescient model is evaluated by a kind
of classifiers, for instance, logistic regression, naive Bayes tree,
artificial neural network, support vector system, decision tree, random
forest, and k-nearest neighbor. Additionally, we used set processes to
evolve the presentation of these classifiers. We utilized Boosting,
Random Forest, Bagging, and Voting Algorithms, which are the normal
group of techniques used in studies. By using ensemble methods, we will
have a good result that demonstrates the dependability of the proposed
model. For better productivity, the various classifiers are gathered
and, afterward, added to the ensemble method using the Vote procedure.
The implementation results demonstrate that the bagging method
accomplished a cleared enhancement with the DT model, where the DT
algorithm accuracy with bagging increased from 90.4\% to 91.4\%. Recall
results improved from 0.904 to 0.914. Precision results also increased
from 0.905 to 0.915.},

 abstract = {Early prediction of students' learning performance and analysis of
student behavior in a virtual learning environment (VLE) are crucial to
minimize the high failure rate in online courses during the COVID-19
pandemic. Nevertheless, traditional machine learning models fail to
predict student performance in the early weeks due to the lack of
students' activities' data in a week-wise timely manner (i.e.,
spatiotemporal feature issues). Furthermore, the imbalanced data
distribution in the VLE impacts the prediction model performance. Thus,
there are severe challenges in handling spatiotemporal features,
imbalanced data sets, and a lack of explainability for enhancing the
confidence of the prediction system. Therefore, an intelligent framework
for explainable student performance prediction (ESPP) is proposed in
this study in order to provide the interpretability of the prediction
results. First, this framework utilized a time-series weekly student
activity data set and dealt with the VLE imbalanced data distribution
using a hybrid data sampling method. Then, a combination of
convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) was
employed to extract the spatiotemporal features and develop the early
prediction deep learning (DL) model. Finally, the DL model was explained
by visualizing and analyzing typical predictions, students' activities'
maps, and feature importance. The numerical results of cross-validation
showed that the proposed new DL model (i.e., the combined CNN-LSTM and
ConvLSTM), in the early prediction cases, performed better than the
baseline models of LSTM, support vector machine (SVM), and logistic
regression (LR) models.},

 abstract = {As more educational data becomes available, learning analytics and
educational data mining are allowing instructors to make data-driven
decisions like never before. Much of the work in learning analytics and
educational data mining has been done in traditional subjects like math
and reading, but these tools also have the potential to shape our
understanding of the complexity of engineering design and innovation.
This work uses learning analytics and educational data mining to analyze
and interpret student data collected in a course where students work on
innovation projects. Specifically, this work improves previous
classification models developed for innovation in classroom settings by
implementing the Innovation-Based Learning (IBL) Framework - a
qualitative model that sorts student actions into seven categories. The
models developed include 1) a text classifier that automatically groups
student text into the categories of the IBL framework with higher
reliability than a team of human raters (kappa = 0.760 versus kappa =
0.627), 2) a text classifier that uses the IBL framework to predict
student performance on new cohorts better than previously developed
models (ROC AUC = 0.710 versus ROC AUC = 0.640), and 3) a quantitative
classifier that uses the IBL framework to differentiate between lower
and higher performing students better than previously developed models
(ROC AUC = 0.782 versus ROC AUC = 0.491). Not only does this work detail
the development and testing of these models, but it also uses the
results to suggest best practices of teaching innovation in educational
settings.},

 abstract = {In the context of programming language courses, offering early and
personalized assistance to students with difficulties in solving code
exercises is fundamental to helping them improve their performance. To
this end, it is desirable to detect those students with behavioral
patterns that could potentially result in poor performance in a timely
manner. In this study, we analyze different behavioral metrics for
predicting the performance of students in a 2nd-year computer science
course. Metrics are extracted from practical sessions, that is, code
exercise labs that may be finished online during a period of 5-7 days.
In addition to well-known metrics (e.g., the relative time spent solving
compilation/execution errors or skills for removing compilation errors),
we also incorporate metrics that take into account the work habits of
students (e.g., timestamps in which the student has undertaken 25\%,
50\%, and 75\% of the exercise lab) and similarity between codes. With a
sample of 224 students from seven different course groups, we construct
robust predictors by training different machine learning models,
reaching an R-2 value of up to 0.40. We also perform a machine
learning-based analysis for detecting the most relevant response
variables and analyze their relations to the final grades of students.
The results show that the newly considered metrics have enough
predictive power to be considered in the model. Finally, we graphically
illustrate the nonlinear and seemingly interdependent relations that
exist between predictor and response variables.},

 abstract = {Engineering Mathematics requires that problem-solving should be
implemented through ongoing assessments; hence the prediction of student
performance using continuous assessments remains an important task for
engineering educators, mainly to monitor and improve their teaching
practice. This paper develops probabilistic models to predict weighted
scores (WS, or the overall mark leading to a final grade) for
face-to-face (on-campus) and web-based (online) Advanced Engineering
Mathematics students at an Australian regional university over a 6-year
period (2013-2018). We fitted parametric and non-parametric D-vine
copula models utilizing multiple quizzes, assignments and examination
score results to construct and validate the predicted WS in
independently test datasets. The results are interpreted in terms of the
probability of whether a student's continuous performance (i.e.,
individually or jointly with other counterpart assessments) is likely to
lead to a passing grade conditional upon joint performance in students'
quizzes and assignment scores. The results indicate that the newly
developed D-vine model, benchmarked against a linear regression model,
can generate accurate grade predictions, and particularly handle the
problem of low or high scores (tail dependence) compared with a
conventional model for both face-to-face, and web-based students.
Accordingly, the findings advocate the practical utility of joint copula
models that capture the dependence structure in engineering mathematics
students' marks achieved. This therefore, provide insights through
learning analytic methods to support an engineering educator's teaching
decisions. The implications are on better supporting engineering
mathematics students' success and retention, developing evidence-based
strategies consistent with engineering graduate requirements through
improved teaching and learning, and identifying/addressing the risk of
failure through early intervention. The proposed methods can guide an
engineering educator's practice by investigating joint influences of
engineering problem-solving assessments on their student's grades.},

 abstract = {Educational data mining is becoming a more and more popular research
field in recent years, mainly with the help of cross research conducted
by various disciplines, so as to solve various difficult problems in the
teaching and education process. In this paper, we proposed a hybrid
approach for student performance prediction. We collected the dataset,
including 15 characteristics of students from three categories
(individual basic information, individual education information, and
individual behavior information). Based on the random forest (RF) and
simulated annealing (SA) algorithms, we binary encode the relevant
parameters (number of features, tree size, and tree decision weights) as
the target variables for algorithm optimization, use the out-of-bag
error as the optimization objective function, and then propose the IRFC
(improved random forest classifier) algorithm in this paper. Compared
with other mainstream improved random forest algorithms, the research
results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm in this paper has higher
generalization ability and smaller OOB error. This study provides a
methodological reference for the prediction of student achievement and
also makes a marginal contribution to student management work.},

 abstract = {This study introduces data mining methods to accounting education
scholarship to explore the relationship between accounting students'
current academic performance (grades), demographic information,
pre-university entrance scores and predicted academic performance. It
adopts a C4.5 classification algorithm based on decision-tree analysis
to examine 640 accounting students enrolled in an undergraduate
accounting program at an Australian university. A significant
contribution of this study is improved prediction of academic
performance and identification of characteristics of students deemed to
be at risk. By partitioning students into sub-groups based on tertiary
entrance scores and employing clustering of study units, this study
facilitates a more nuanced understanding of predictor attributes. Key
findings were the dominance of a cluster of second year units in
predicting students' later academic performance; that gender did not
influence performance; and that performance in first year at university,
rather than secondary school grades, was the most important predictor of
subsequent academic performance.},

 abstract = {Learning analysis provides a new opportunity for the development of
online education, and has received extensive attention from scholars at
home and abroad. How to use data and models to predict learners'
academic success or failure and give teaching feedback in a timely
manner is a core problem in the field of learning analytics. At present,
many scholars use key learning behaviors to improve the prediction
effect by exploring the implicit relationship between learning behavior
data and grades. At the same time, it is very important to explore the
association between categories and prediction effects in learning
behavior classification. This paper proposes a self-adaptive feature
fusion strategy based on learning behavior classification, aiming to
mine the effective E-learning behavior feature space and further improve
the performance of the learning performance prediction model. First, a
behavior classification model (E-learning Behavior Classification Model,
EBC Model) based on interaction objects and learning process is
constructed; second, the feature space is preliminarily reduced by
entropy weight method and variance filtering method; finally, combined
with EBC Model and a self-adaptive feature fusion strategy to build a
learning performance predictor. The experiment uses the British Open
University Learning Analysis Dataset (OULAD). Through the experimental
analysis, an effective feature space is obtained, that is, the basic
interactive behavior (BI) and knowledge interaction behavior (KI) of
learning behavior category has the strongest correlation with learning
performance.And it is proved that the self-adaptive feature fusion
strategy proposed in this paper can effectively improve the performance
of the learning performance predictor, and the performance index of
accuracy(ACC), F1-score(F1) and kappa(K) reach 98.44\%, 0.9893, 0.9600.
This study constructs E-learning performance predictors and mines the
effective feature space from a new perspective, and provides some
auxiliary references for online learners and managers.},

attributes from the multidimensional space is determined by TPPS.
Several research works were recognized recently to conclude the high
potential factors for observing student academic performances. A novel
technique is designed in this research work to improve the student
academic performance prediction in a taken dataset by choosing more
relevant attributes. To detect the student academic performance with
better accuracy and lesser time, proposed TPPS-AS technique is employed.
The performance of student academic performance prediction is improved
by TPPS-AS technique through the attribute selection with higher
accuracy. With this proposed technique, prediction accuracy of the
student academic performance is increased after the relevant attributes
selection process.},

 abstract = {This paper proposes a network model recurrent fully connected network
(RFC-Net) based on recurrent full convolution and polarization change.
RFC-Net enriches the network by reconstructing and fine-tuning the fully
convolutional network and adding recurrent convolutions to it. By
studying the data mining technology of multidimensional association
rules, based on the existing algorithms, this paper improves the
shortcomings of the algorithms and realizes an efficient and practical
method for data mining based on interdimensional multidimensional
association rules. On the basis of mastering the actual student
information, the effectiveness of the method is tested, and an
employment analysis system based on association rules is established.
Aiming at the fact that traditional grade prediction methods ignore the
different influences of different behavioral characteristics on grades,
and considering that behavioral data in different periods have different
influences on student grades, the grade prediction problem is abstracted
into a time series classification problem. The mechanism is combined
with long short-term memory neural network to construct a performance
prediction model based on Attention-BiLSTM. Experiments show that the
prediction model proposed in this paper improves the accuracy and
effectively improves the prediction quality compared with the logistic
regression model with a better prediction effect in the traditional
benchmark model and the long short-term memory neural network model
without the introduction of the attention mechanism. Research shows that
physical performance and academic performance are not contradictory. We
must face up to the status of physical exercise in schools; as long as
physical exercise is properly arranged, it can inspire students to form
a spirit of unity, interaction, positivity, and perseverance in cultural
studies.},

@article{WOS:000818152100001,
 abstract = {The plethora of changes that have taken place in policy formulations on
higher education in recent years in Greece has led to unification, the
abolition of departments or technological educational institutions (TEI)
and mergers at universities. As a result, many students are required to
complete their studies in departments of the abolished TEI. Dropout or a
delay in graduation is a significant problem that results from newly
joined students at the university, in addition to the provision of
studies. There are various reasons for this, with student performance
during studies being one of the major contributing factors. This study
was aimed at predicting the time required for weak students to pass
their courses so as to allow the university to develop strategic
programs that will help them improve performance and graduate in time.
This paper presents various components of educational data mining
incorporating a new state-of-the-art strategy, called AutoML, which is
used to find the best models and parameters and is capable of predicting
the length of time required for students to pass their courses using
their past course performance and academic information. A dataset of
23,687 ``Computer Networking{''} module students was used to train and
evaluate the classification of a model developed in the KNIME Analytics
(open source) data science platform. The accuracy of the model was
measured using well-known evaluation criteria, such as precision,
recall, and F-measure. The model was applied to data related to three
basic courses and correctly predicted approximately 92\% of students'
performance and, specifically, students who are likely to drop out or
experience a delay before graduating.},

 abstract = {To obtain more accurate and robust feedback information from the
students' assessment outcomes and to communicate it to students and
optimize teaching and learning strategies, educational researchers and
practitioners must critically reflect on whether the existing methods of
data analytics are capable of retrieving the information provided in the
database. This study compared and contrasted the prediction performance
of an item response theory method, particularly the use of an
explanatory item response model (EIRM), and six supervised machine
learning (ML) methods for predicting students' item responses in
educational assessments, considering student- and item-related
background information. Each of seven prediction methods was evaluated
through cross-validation approaches under three prediction scenarios:
(a) unrealized responses of new students to existing items, (b)
unrealized responses of existing students to new items, and (c) missing
responses of existing students to existing items. The results of a
simulation study and two real-life assessment data examples showed that
employing student- and item-related background information in addition
to the item response data substantially increases the prediction
accuracy for new students or items. We also found that the EIRM is as
competitive as the best performing ML methods in predicting the student
performance outcomes for the educational assessment datasets.},

 abstract = {Recent advances in sensor technology, including eye-gaze tracking, have
introduced the opportunity to incorporate gaze into student modelling
within an embodied learning context. The produced multimodal data is
used to uncover cognitive, behavioural, and affective processes during
the embodied learning activity. However, the use of eye-tracking data
presenting visual attention to understand students' behaviours and
learning performance during engagement with tangible learning activity
is rather unexplored. Therefore, this paper explores the integration of
eye-gaze features to predict students' learning performance during an
embodied activity. We present an in-situ study where 110 primary school
students (aged 8-9 years), solved a tangible learning activity for
learning human body anatomy. During the experiment, students' learning
experience was monitored by collecting their eye-tracking data, learning
profiles, academic performances, and time to complete the activity. We
applied predictive modelling to identify the synergies between eye-gaze
features and students' learning performance. The obtained results
suggest that combining eye-gaze tracking with learning traces and
behaviour attributes may support an accurate prediction of students'
learning performance. This research sheds light on the opportunities
offered in the intersection of eye-gaze tracking with learning traces,
and its possible contribution to investigating students' behaviour
within an embodied learning context.},

 abstract = {Educational data mining is an emerging interdisciplinary research area
involving both education and informatics. It has become an imperative
research area due to many advantages that educational institutions can
achieve. Along these lines, various data mining techniques have been
used to improve learning outcomes by exploring large-scale data that
come from educational settings. One of the main problems is predicting
the future achievements of students before taking final exams, so we can
proactively help students achieve better performance and prevent
dropouts. Therefore, many efforts have been made to solve the problem of
student performance prediction in the context of educational data
mining. In this paper, we provide readers with a comprehensive
understanding of student performance prediction and compare
approximately 260 studies in the last 20 years with respect to i) major
factors highly affecting student performance prediction, ii) kinds of
data mining techniques including prediction and feature selection
algorithms, and iii) frequently used data mining tools. The findings of
the comprehensive analysis show that ANN and Random Forest are mostly
used data mining algorithms, while WEKA is found as a trending tool for
students' performance prediction. Students' academic records and
demographic factors are the best attributes to predict performance. The
study proves that irrelevant features in the dataset reduce the
prediction results and increase model processing time. Therefore, almost
half of the studies used feature selection techniques before building
prediction models. This study attempts to provide useful and valuable
information to researchers interested in advancing educational data
mining. The study directs future researchers to achieve highly accurate
prediction results in different scenarios using different available
inputs or techniques. The study also helps institutions apply data
mining techniques to predict and improve student outcomes by providing
additional assistance on time.},

 abstract = {Student performance prediction has attracted increasing attention in the
field of educational data mining, or more broadly, intelligent education
or ``AI + education{''}. Accurate performance prediction plays a
significant role in solving the problem of a student dropping out,
promoting personalized learning and improving teaching efficiency, etc.
Traditional student performance prediction methods usually ignore the
potential (underlying) relationship among students. In this paper, we
use graph structure to reflect the students' relationships and propose a
novel pipeline for student performance prediction based on
newly-developed multi-topology graph neural networks (termed MTGNN). In
particular, we propose various ways for graph construction based on
similarity learning using different distance metrics. Based on the
multiple graphs of different topologies, we design an MTGNN module, as a
key module in the pipeline, to deal with the semi-supervised node
classification problem where each node represents a student (and the
node label is the student's performance, e.g., Pass/Fail/Withdrawal). An
attention-based method is developed to produce the unified graph
representation in MTGNN. The effectiveness of the proposed pipeline is
verified in a case study, where a real-world educational dataset and
several existing approaches are used for performance comparison. The
experiment results show that, compared with some traditional machine
learning methods and the vanilla graph convolutional network with only a
single graph topology, our proposed pipeline works effectively and
favorably in student performance prediction.},

 abstract = {Educational Data Mining is widely used for predicting student's
performance. It's a challenging task because a plethora of features
related to demographics, personality traits, socio-economic, and
environmental may affect students' performance. Such varying features
may depend on the level of study, program offered, nature of subject,
and geographical location. This study attempted to predict the final
semester's results of students studying Doctor of Veterinary Medicine
(DVM) based on their pre-admission academic achievements, demographics,
and first semester performance. The imbalanced data led to non-generic
prediction models, so it was addressed through synthetic minority
oversampling technique. Among five prediction models, the Support Vector
Machine led the best with 92\% accuracy. The decision tree model
identified key features affecting students' performance. The analysis
led to the conclusion that marks obtained in Biology, Islamiat, and Urdu
at Matric and English at Intermediate level affected the students'
performance in their final semester. The findings provide useful
information to predict students' performance and guidelines for academic
institutes' management regarding improving students' achievement. It is
speculated that adoption of digital transformation may help reduce
difficulty faced in data collection and analysis.},

 abstract = {Student retention is a widely recognized challenge in the educational
community to assist the institutes in the formation of appropriate and
effective pedagogical interventions. This study intends to predict the
students at risk of low performance during an on-going course, those at
risk of graduating late than the tentative timeline. and predicts the
capacity of students in a campus. The data constitutes of demographics,
learning, academic, and education-related attributes that are suitable
to deploy various machine learning algorithms for the prediction of
at-risk students. For class balancing, synthetic minority over sampling
technique is also applied to eliminate the imbalance in the academic
award-gap performances and late/timely graduates. Results reveal the
effectiveness of the deployed techniques with long short-term memory
(LSTM) outperforming other models for early prediction of at-risk
students. The main contribution of this work is a machine learning
approach capable of enhancing the academic decision-making related to
student performance.},

 abstract = {Over the past few years, the growing popularity of online education has
enabled there to be a large amount of students' learning behavior data
stored, which brings great opportunities and challenges to the field of
educational data mining. Students' learning performance can be
predicted, based on students' learning behavior data, so as to identify
at-risk students who need timely help to complete their studies and
improve students' learning performance and online teaching quality. In
order to make full use of these learning behavior data, a new prediction
method was designed based on existing research. This method constructs a
hybrid deep learning model, which can simultaneously obtain the temporal
behavior information and the overall behavior information from the
learning behavior data, so that it can more accurately predict the
high-risk students. When compared with existing deep learning methods,
the experimental results show that the proposed method offers better
predicting performance.},

 abstract = {Educational Data Mining (EDM) is a branch of data mining that focuses on
extraction of useful knowledge from data generated through academic
activities at school, college or at university level. The extracted
knowledge can help to perform the academic activities in a better way,
so it is useful for students, parents and institutions themselves. One
common activity in EDM is students grade prediction with an aim to
identify weak or at-risk students. An early identification of such
students helps to take supportive measures that may help students to
improve. Among a vast number of approaches available in this field, this
study mainly focuses on generating a smarter dataset through reduced
feature set without compromising the number of records in it and then
producing an approach which combines the strengths of classification and
clustering for better prediction results. In this study it has been
identified that individual features have distinct effect and that
removing misclassified data can affect the overall results. Backward
selection is adopted using Pearson correlation as a metric to produce
smarter dataset with lesser attributes and better accuracy in
prediction. After feature set selection, we have applied EMT (Ensemble
Meta-Based Tree Model) classification on it to identify best performing
classifiers from five families of classifiers. In hybrid approach, first
the ensemble clustering is applied on smart dataset and then EMT
classification is applied to reevaluate the un-clustered data, which
gives a boost in performance and provides us an accuracy of 93\%.},

 abstract = {Student performance calculation is an essential process in online
learning scheme, which intends to afford students along with admittance
to active learning. Student performance forecast is most concerning
problem in education and training field, particularly in educational
data mining (EDM). The prediction process provisions the students to
choose courses and intend suitable training strategies for themselves.
Furthermore, student performance calculation permits lecturers and
educational supervisors to designate which students should be observed
and maintained to finish their plans with finest outcomes. These
provisions can decrease the official notices and exclusions from
universities because of students' poor performance. In this paper,
Political Fractional Competitive Multi-verse Optimization enabled Deep
Neuro fuzzy network (PFCMVO enabled DNFN) uses spark framework for
student performance calculation. Moreover, Yeo-Johnson transformation is
applied for transforming the input data for effectual student
performance prediction. In addition, Damerau-Levenshtein (DL) distance
is applied to select appropriate features. The DNFN classifier is
utilized to execute student performance prediction where the classifier
is trained by PFCMVO algorithm. The developed student performance
prediction model outperforms than the other existing techniques with
respect to Precision, Recall, F-measure, and Prediction accuracy of
0.9259, 0.9321, 0.9290, and 0.9372 for dataset-1 and 0.9126, 0.9271,

 abstract = {Apparently, most life activities that people perform depend on their
unique characteristics. Personal characteristics vary across people, so
they perform tasks in different ways based on their skills. People have
different mental, psychological, and behavioral features that affect
most life activities. This is the same case with students at various
educational levels. Students have different features that affect their
academic performance. The academic score is the main indicator of the
student's performance. However, other factors such as personality
features, intelligence level, and basic personal data can have a great
influence on the student's performance. This means that the academic
score is not the only indicator that can be used in predicting students'
performance. Consequently, an approach based on personal data,
personality features, and intelligence quotient is proposed to predict
the performance of university undergraduates. Five machine learning
techniques were used in the proposed approach. In order to evaluate the
performance of the proposed approach, a real student's dataset was used,
and various performance measures were computed. Several experiments were
performed to determine the impact of various features on the student's
performance. The proposed approach gave promising results when tested on
the dataset.},

 abstract = {Performance prediction is an important research facet of educational
data mining. Most models extract student behavior features from campus
card data for prediction. However, most of these methods have coarse
time granularity, difficulty in extracting useful high-order behavior
combination features, dependence on 6 historical achievements, etc. To
solve these problems, this paper utilizes prediction of grade point
average (GPA prediction) and whether a specific student has failing
subjects (failing prediction) in a term as the goal of performance
prediction and proposes a comprehensive performance prediction model of
college students based on behavior features. First, a method for
representing campus card data based on behavior flow is introduced to
retain higher time accuracy. Second, a method for extracting student
behavior features based on multi-head self-attention mechanism is
proposed to automatically select more important high-order behavior
combination features. Finally, a performance prediction model based on
student behavior feature mode difference is proposed to improve the
model's prediction accuracy and increases the model's robustness for
students with significant changes in performance. The performance of the
model is verified on actual data collected by the teaching monitoring
big data platform of Xi'an Jiaotong University. The results show that
the model's prediction performance is better than the comparison
algorithms on both the failing prediction and GPA prediction.},

 abstract = {Higher education institutions record a significant amount of data about
their students, representing a considerable potential to generate
information, knowledge, and monitoring. Both school dropout and
educational failure in higher education are an obstacle to economic
growth, employment, competitiveness, and productivity, directly
impacting the lives of students and their families, higher education
institutions, and society as a whole. The dataset described here results
from the aggregation of information from different disjointed data
sources and includes demographic, socioeconomic, macroeconomic, and
academic data on enrollment and academic performance at the end of the
first and second semesters. The dataset is used to build machine
learning models for predicting academic performance and dropout, which
is part of a Learning Analytic tool developed at the Polytechnic
Institute of Portalegre that provides information to the tutoring team
with an estimate of the risk of dropout and failure. The dataset is
useful for researchers who want to conduct comparative studies on
student academic performance and also for training in the machine
learning area.},

 abstract = {There is an increasing demand for predicting the students' performance
in undergraduate level to help the decision makers to plan the admission
of students to the various specializations. Whereas Prince Sattam
University (PSU) and Sana'a University (SU) have large databases of
students' information, such databases are not used effectively for
decision-making. One of such difficulties stems from the weakness of
some statistical methods in analyzing large volumes of data, resulting
in unreliable outputs and results. In order to overcome these
difficulties, alternative methods are constantly developed by
researchers. As data mining simulates the role of a data analyst in
exploring the relationships between data as authenticated in the actual
data records, one of the most popular data mining techniques is the
predictive model. Curve estimation model (CEM) stands by far as the most
important predictive modeling technique. The CEM is used to build a
highly efficient regression model to boost the accuracy of the results
which can then be generalized. This paper mainly aims to build an
accurate regression model to predict the extent to which the mean of
admission criteria (MAC) contributes to the academic achievement for the
two universities' students. The proposed model will be of help to
university decision-makers in predicting students with more likelihood
of poor academic attainment and helping such students improve the level
of their educational attainment or to redirect them to specializations
suiting their abilities. In terms of methodology, the investigation
started by collecting the datasets, followed by data preprocessing
stage, model establishment stage, and pattern evaluation stage. The
results confirmed that the cubic model was the best model for both the
universities. Further, the decision-makers at both universities are
advised to use the cubic model when forecasting the students' academic
achievement based on the mean of admission criteria. Also, results
showed that it could identify at-risk students in a timely manner and
improve the overall efficiency and effectiveness of education
management. Further, the decision-makers in all the universities are
recommended to utilize the data mining techniques based on the CEM,
being the potential mean to analyze very large size records in quite
short time.},

 abstract = {Data mining approaches have been widely used to estimate student
performance in online education. Various Machine Learning (ML) based
data mining techniques have been developed to evaluate student
performance accurately. However, they face specific issues in
implementation. Hence, a novel hybrid Elman Neural with Apriori Mining
(ENAM) approach was presented in this article to predict student
performance in online education. The designed model was validated with
the student's performance dataset. Incorporating the Elman neural system
eliminates the noise data present in the dataset. Moreover, meaningful
features are extracted in feature analysis and trained in the system.
Then, the student's performances are sorted based on their average score
and classified as good, bad, or average. In addition, a case study was
developed to describe the working of the designed model. The presented
approach was executed in python software, and performance metrics were
estimated. Moreover, a comparative analysis was performed to prove that
the proposed system earned better outcomes than existing approaches.},

 abstract = {Prediction of Student performance through a machine predicts a student's
future success. It can be considered an essential procedure to determine
the students' academic excellence and identify them at high risk for
academic performance. Prediction of student performance also provides
universities with a high reputation and ranking. The evaluation of `What
students can do with their learning' is still a tedious task. There are
many challenging factors to solve this problem, mainly owing to the
enormous amount of data collected from students. Most of the research
works have focused on developing new methodologies for student
performance prediction. But all the existing work has some performance
limitations. Here, a new model called transient search capsule network
based on the deep Autoencoder (TSCNDE) is introduced to detect student
performance. The TSCNDE method is implemented with the help of the
PYTHON tool. The performance prediction process has been completed with
the help of the OULA dataset. The obtained results are assessed on
accuracy (99.2\%), precision, (99.8\%), specificity (98.7\%), and
sensitivity (98.9\%) parameters. The results obtained showed that the
TSCNDE method is about 99.2\% more accurate than the other related
method. Also, the obtained results are compared with some existing deep
learning and machine learning methods.},

 abstract = {Prior education research has focused on using learning analytics to
predict the academic performance of Massive Online Learning Courses
(MOOCs) and e- learning courses in universities. There is limited
research on online learning that has been transitioned from physical
classes and that has continued to use active learning approaches in an
online environment. This study aims to determine the variables affecting
students' academic performance for a computing course in a
research-intense university during the COVID-19 pandemic. Variables that
are indicative of self-regulated learning such as time management,
frequency of accessing learning materials and the Learning Management
System (LMS), participation in assessment activities and discussions,
and the results of formative assessments were extracted from the LMS
reports and log files to predict the students' total marks and final
exam results. The findings revealed that good time management and active
participation are important for academic success. The results also
supported the model for the early prediction of summative assessment
performance using formative assessment results. Additionally, this study
concludes that the gap in predictive power between formative assessment
results and online learning behaviors is small. This research is
considered unique because it demonstrates predictive models for
students' academic success for an institution that was forced to
transition from physical to online learning. It highlights the
importance of self-regulated learning behavior and formative assessments
in the contemporary era.},

 abstract = {Currently, educational data mining act as a major part of student
performance prediction approaches and their applications. However, more
ensemble methods are needed to improve the student performance
prediction, and also which helps increase the learning quality of the
Student's performance. The usage of an ensemble classifier with rule
mining to predict students' academic success is proposed. In response to
this need, this research mainly concentrated on an ensemble classifier
with rule mining to predict students' academic success. The feature
mining is performed using the weighted Rough Set Theory method, in which
the proposed meta-heuristic algorithm optimizes the weight function. The
variable optimization of the ensemble classifier is accomplished with
the help of a combination of Harris Hawks Optimization (HHO), and Krill
Herd Algorithm (KHA) known as Escape Energy Searched Krill Herd-Harris
Hawks Optimization (EES-KHHO) for maximizing the prediction rate.
Extensive tests are carried out on various datasets, and the findings
show that our technique outperforms conventional approaches. Throughout
the result analysis, the offered method attains a 92.77\% accuracy rate,
and also it attains a sensitivity rate of 94.87\%. Therefore, the
offered student performance prediction model achieves better
effectiveness regarding various performance metrics.},

 abstract = {To understand students' learning behaviors, this study uses machine
learning technologies to analyze the data of interactive learning
environments, and then predicts students' learning outcomes. This study
adopted a variety of machine learning classification methods, quizzes,
and programming system logs, found that students' learning
characteristics were correlated with their learning performance when
they encountered similar programming practice. In this study, we used
random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression
(LR), and neural network (NN) algorithms to predict whether students
would submit on time for the course. Among them, the NN algorithm showed
the best prediction results. Education-related data can be predicted by
machine learning techniques, and different machine learning models with
different hyperparameters can be used to obtain better results.},

 abstract = {Education is very important for students' future success. The
performance of students can be supported by the extra assignments and
projects given by the instructors for students with low performance.
However, a major problem is that students at-risk cannot be identified
early. This situation is being investigated by various researchers using
Machine Learning techniques. Machine learning is used in a variety of
areas and has also begun to be used to identify students at-risk early
and to provide support by instructors. This research paper discusses the
performance results found using Machine learning algorithms to identify
at-risk students and minimize student failure. The main purpose of this
project is to create a hybrid model using the ensemble stacking method
and to predict at-risk students using this model. We used machine
learning algorithms such as Naive Bayes, Random Forest, Decision Tree,
K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, AdaBoost Classifier and
Logistic Regression in this project. The performance of each machine
learning algorithm presented in the project was measured with various
metrics. Thus, the hybrid model by combining algorithms that give the
best prediction results is presented in this study. The data set
containing the demographic and academic information of the students was
used to train and test the model. In addition, a web application
developed for the effective use of the hybrid model and for obtaining
prediction results is presented in the report. In the proposed method,
it has been realized that stratified k-fold cross validation and
hyperparameter optimization techniques increased the performance of the
models. The hybrid ensemble model was tested with a combination of two
different datasets to understand the importance of the data features. In
first combination, the accuracy of the hybrid model was obtained as
94.8\% by using both demographic and academic data. In the second
combination, when only academic data was used, the accuracy of the
hybrid model increased to 98.4\%. This study focuses on predicting the
performance of at-risk students early. Thus, teachers will be able to
provide extra assistance to students with low performance.},

 abstract = {Student performance predictive analysis has played a vital role in
education in recent years. It allows for the understanding students'
learning behaviours, the identification of at-risk students, and the
development of insights into teaching and learning improvement.
Recently, many researchers have used data collected from Learning
Management Systems to predict student performance. This study
investigates the potential of clickstream data for this purpose. A total
of 5341 sample students and their click behaviour data from the OULAD
(Open University Learning Analytics Dataset) are used. The raw
clickstream data are transformed, integrating the time and activity
dimensions of students' click actions. Two feature sets are extracted,
indicating the number of clicks on 12 learning sites based on weekly and
monthly time intervals. For both feature sets, the experiments are
performed to compare deep learning algorithms (including LSTM and
1D-CNN) with traditional machine learning approaches. It is found that
the LSTM algorithm outperformed other approaches on a range of
evaluation metrics, with up to 90.25\% accuracy. Four out of twelve
learning sites (content, subpage, homepage, quiz) are identified as
critical in influencing student performance in the course. The insights
from these critical learning sites can inform the design of future
courses and teaching interventions to support at-risk students.},

 abstract = {Modelling learning behaviors and predicting student performance in
massive open online courses (MOOCs) are vital for adaptive course
planning and personalized intervention. This study proposes a new
approach for discovering time-embedded behavioral patterns in micro
behaviors of MOOC learners and incorporating them as features for
student profiling and learning performance prediction. We embedded
discretized time intervals into interaction sequences and used n-gram
extraction to output time-related behavioral patterns. With log data
from a Python programming MOOC with 591 learners, we exploited
exploration data analysis, unsupervised, and supervised learning to
elucidate the associations between time-related behavioral patterns and
academic performance. Nine out of seventeen targeted patterns are highly
correlated with the final grade, in which, three patterns related to the
help-seeking, evaluation, and study activities with short or medium
intervals (less than two minutes) are strong predictors of academic
performance in a very early stage. The time-related behavioral patterns
also serve as good features for clustering learners into three groups
based on learning behaviors: Sampling learners, Comprehensive learners,
and Targeting learners. Our empirical results show the usability of the
proposed time-embedded behavioral patterns in immediate diagnosis
learners' engagement, raising new challenges for learning analytics with
time concerning to achieve precision education.},

 abstract = {The process of teaching and learning is the most powerful tool that
teachers and professors have, because it is the main way that students
change in the ways that teachers and professors want them to. TQM is
recommended as a way to control, monitor, and improve the quality of
teaching and learning strategies in the classroom. In line with the
principles of TQM, evaluations of things like results and feedback are
used to improve teaching and learning. The level of academic success
that a program's students have may say a lot about how good that
programme is. You can predict how well a student will do in school in
the future by looking at how well they did in the past. After more
research, it might be possible to find a link between the students'
grades and their skills and interests. When teachers have this kind of
information, they are better able to focus on the students who are
having the most trouble. This article shows how to use feature selection
and machine learning to improve the quality of teaching and learning in
higher education by predicting how well a student will do in school. The
performance of university students is used as an input to a
classification model. First, ant colony optimization is used to choose
the most important features. Then, KNN, Naive Bayes, and decision tree
algorithms are used to classify the chosen data. Based on accuracy,
recall, and F1 score, KNN performs better.},

 abstract = {Predicting student performance is crucial in higher education, as it
facilitates course selection and the development of appropriate future
study plans. The process of supporting the instructors and supervisors
in monitoring students in order to upkeep them and combine training
programs to get the best outcomes. It decreases the official warning
signs and inefficient students' expulsions. Therefore, analysis of
students' performance on various academic tests is critical for future
skill development. Despite the fact that existing performance prediction
systems based on Deep Learning (DL) technologies such as Artificial
Neural Networks (ANN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) have outperformed
Machine Learning (ML) -based systems in the prediction task, there are
still a few issues. Ignorance of relevant features, analysis limitations
to the existing amount of data points, and ambiguity in student records
are only a few of these issues. This research proposes a novel Student
Academic Performance Predicting (SAPP) system to address these issues
and enhance prediction accuracy. It has a better architecture that uses
a combination of 4-layer stacked Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network,
Random Forest (RF), and Gradient Boosting (GB) techniques to predict
students' pass or fail outcomes. Additionally, the proposed SAPP system
is compared to existing prediction systems using publicly accessible
student OULAD dataset with an addition of self-curated emotional
dataset. The performance of SAPP system is measured using Accuracy,
Precision, F-measure, and Recall parameters. The results of proposed
algorithm (LSTM + RF + B) is compared with LSTM + RF, LSTM + B and end
to end DL models such as ANN, LSTM, RNN, Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) and most commonly utilized ML models in the literature such as
Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), Naive Bayes (NB) and
RF. The proposed SAPP system gained approximately 96\% prediction
accuracy that is comparatively higher than existing systems.},

 abstract = {Predicting and understanding student learning performance has been a
long-standing task in learning science, which can benefit personalized
teaching and learning. This study shows that the progress towards this
task can be accelerated by using learning record data to feed a deep
learning model that considers the intrinsic course association and the
structured features. We proposed a multi-source sparse attention
convolutional neural network (MsaCNN) to predict the course grades in a
general formulation. MsaCNN adopts multi-scale convolution kernels on
student grade records to capture structured features, a global attention
strategy to discover the relationship between courses, and multiple
input-heads to integrate multi-source features. All achieved features
are then poured into a softmax classifier towards an end-to-end
supervised deep learning model. Conducting insights into higher
education on real-world university datasets, the results show that
MsaCNN achieves better performance than traditional methods and delivers
an interpretation of student performance by virtue of the resulted
course relationships. Inspired by this interpretation, we created an
association map for all mentioned courses, followed by evaluating the
map with a questionnaire survey. This study provides computer-aided
system tools and discovers the course-space map from the educational
data, potentially facilitating the personalized learning progress.},

 abstract = {Accompanied with the development of storage and processing capacity of
modern technology, educational data increases sharply. It is difficult
for educational researchers to derive useful information from much
educational data. Therefore, educational data mining techniques are
important for the development of modern education field. Recently,
researches have demonstrated that machine learning, as an important tool
for data mining, has shown promising performance in educational
applications, especially in student performance prediction. However, few
studies comprehensively compare existing machine learning methods in
educational data. Moreover, most current studies only focus on a single
type of educational data for student performance prediction. In this
paper, three different types of task-oriented educational data are
employed to investigate the performance of machine learning methods in
different application scenarios. Specifically, seven parameter-optimized
machine learning methods are implemented to study multiple types of
performance prediction, including binary and multi-classification
prediction tasks. In the experimental section, four evaluation metrics
and visualizations are presented for a comparative study of different
methods on three tasks, and an elaborated discussion of the experimental
results is provided. The experimental results demonstrate that Random
Forest has achieved superior generality on all selected datasets. In
addition, the performance of Decision Tree and Artificial Neural Network
models on the selected datasets indicates that they are also potential
candidates to solve student performance prediction tasks.},

 abstract = {Data mining approaches have proven to be successful in improving
learners' interaction with educational computer games. Despite the
potential of predictive modelling in providing timely adaptive learning
and gameplay experience, there is a lack of research on the early
prediction of learners' performance in educational games. In this
research, we propose an early predictive modelling approach, called
GameEPM, to estimate learners' final scores in an educational game for
promoting computational thinking. Specifically, the GameEPM approach
models the sequence of learners' actions and then uses a limited
sequence of the actions to predict the final score of the game for each
learner. The findings from our initial trials show that our approach can
accurately and robustly estimate the learners' performance at the early
stages of the game. Using less than 50\% of learners' action sequences,
the cross-validated deep learning model achieves a squared correlation
higher than 0.8 with a relative error of less than 8\%, outperforming a
range of regression models like linear regression, random forest, neural
networks, and support vector machines. An additional experiment showed
that the validated deep learning model can also achieve high performance
while tested on an independent game dataset, showing its applicability
and robustness in real-world cases. Comparing the results with
traditional machine learning methods revealed that, in the validation
and application phases, up to 0.30 and 0.35 R-2 gain is achieved in
favor of the deep learning model, respectively. Finally, we found that
while the lengths of action sequences influence the predictive power of
the traditional machine learning methods, this effect is not substantial
in the deep learning model.},

 abstract = {The explosive increase in educational data and information systems has
led to new teaching practices, challenges, and learning processes. To
effectively manage and analyze this information, it is crucial to adopt
innovative methodologies and techniques. Recommender systems (RSs) offer
a solution for advising students and guiding their learning journeys by
utilizing statistical methods such as machine learning (ML) and graph
analysis to analyze program and student data. This paper introduces an
RS for advisors and students that analyzes student records to develop
personalized study plans over multiple semesters. The proposed system
integrates ideas from graph theory, performance modeling, ML,
explainable recommendations, and an intuitive user interface. The system
implicitly implements many academic rules through network analysis.
Accordingly, a systematic and comprehensive review of different
students' plans was possible using metrics developed in the mathematical
graph theory. The proposed system systematically assesses and measures
the relevance of a particular student's study plan. Experiments on
datasets collected at the University of Dubai show that the model
presented in this study outperforms similar ML-based solutions in terms
of different metrics. Typically, up to 86\% accuracy and recall have
been achieved. Additionally, the lowest mean square regression (MSR)
rate of 0.14 has been attained compared to other state-of-the-art
regressors.},

 abstract = {Higher educational institutes generate massive amounts of student data.
This data needs to be explored in depth to better understand various
facets of student learning behavior. The educational data mining
approach has given provisions to extract useful and non-trivial
knowledge from large collections of student data. Using the educational
data mining method of classification, this research analyzes data of 291
university students in an attempt to predict student performance at the
end of a 4-year degree program. A student segmentation framework has
also been proposed to identify students at various levels of academic
performance. Coupled with the prediction model, the proposed
segmentation framework provides a useful mechanism for devising
pedagogical policies to increase the quality of education by mitigating
academic failure and encouraging higher performance. The experimental
results indicate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and the
applicability of classifying students into multiple performance levels
using a small subset of courses being taught in the initial two years of
the 4-year degree program.},

 abstract = {In Jordanian higher education institutions, a competency exam was
developed to ensure that students had the ability to attain particular
competence levels. The results of the competency examination are one of
the measures used as key performance indicators (KPIs) evaluating the
quality of academic programs and universities. There are numerous
evaluation methods for students' performances based on the academic
achievement of the pupils, including the application of conventional
statistical approaches and machine learning. The objective of this paper
is to develop a framework to help decision-makers and universities
evaluate academic programs using ML by identifying programs and learning
outcomes that need to be established by analyzing competency exam data.
The developed framework can also reduce exam costs by substituting
machine learning algorithms for the actual execution of the exam. We
have created a dataset that can assist academics with their study; the
dataset includes demographic and academic data about students, such as
their gender, average university degree, type of university, and
outcomes on the competency exam based on their level and competencies.
Experiments supported the claim that models trained using samples from
the student sub-dataset outperform models constructed using samples from
the entire dataset. In addition, the experiments demonstrated that ML
algorithms are an effective tool for recognizing patterns in student
performance. Experiments demonstrated that no single ML model
outperforms other ML models. However, the MLP model generates more
accurate models, making them more beneficial for developing robust
frameworks.},

 abstract = {Institutions of higher learning have made persistent efforts to provide
students with a high-quality education. Educational data mining (EDM)
enables academic institutions to gain insight into student data in order
to extract information for making predictions. COVID-19 represents the
most catastrophic pandemic in human history. As a result of the global
pandemic, all educational systems were shifted to online learning (OL).
Due to issues with accessing the internet, disinterest, and a lack of
available tools, online education has proven challenging for many
students. Acquiring accurate education has emerged as a major goal for
the future of this popular medium of education. Therefore, the focus of
this research was to identifying attributes that could help in students'
performance prediction through a generalizable model achieving precision
education in online education. The dataset used in this research was
compiled from a survey taken primarily during the academic year of
COVID-19, which was taken from the perspective of Pakistani university
students. Five machine learning (ML) regressors were used in order to
train the model, and its results were then analyzed. Comparatively, SVM
has outperformed the other methods, yielding 87.5\% accuracy, which was
the highest of all the models tested. After that, an efficient hybrid
ensemble model of machine learning was used to predict student
performance using NB, KNN, SVM, decision tree, and logical regression
during the COVID-19 period, yielding outclass results. Finally, the
accuracy obtained through the hybrid ensemble model was obtained as
98.6\%, which demonstrated that the hybrid ensemble learning model has
performed better than any other model for predicting the performance of
students.},

 abstract = {Improving student learning performance requires proper preparation and
strategy so that it has an impact on improving the quality of education.
One of the preparatory steps is to make a prediction modeling of student
performance. Accurate student performance prediction models are needed
to help teachers develop the potential of diverse students. This
research aims to create a predictive model of student performance with
hyperparameter optimization in the Support Vector Regression Algorithm.
The hyperparameter optimization method used is the Metaheuristic
Algorithm. The Metaheuristic Algorithms used in this study are Particle
Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Genetic Algorithm (GA). After obtaining the
best SVR hyperparameter, the next step is to model student performance
predictions, which in this study produced two models, namely PSVR
Modeling and GSVR Modeling. The resulting predictive modeling will also
be compared with previous researchers' prediction modeling of student
performance using five models: Support Vector Regression, Naive Bayes,
Neural Network, Decision Tree, and Random Forest. The regression
performance metric parameter, Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), evaluates
modeling results. The test results show that predictive student
performance using PSVR Modeling produces the smallest RMSE value of
1.608 compared to predictions of student performance by previous
researchers so that the proposed prediction model can be used to predict
student performance in the future.},

Predic-tion can follow Educational Data Mining, which seeks to make
student performance quantitative, guiding teachers and educational
institutions. Multiple Linear Regression is a forecasting metho-dology
that can be applied to educational data, as is the case of data from the
Exame Nacional do Ensino Medio (ENEM). Based on data from the ENEM 2019
edition, this research proposed, tested and analyzed seven multiple
regression models based on a sample of 18.908 candidates. Such models
considered the scores of the tests of (i) Languages, Codes and their
Technologies, (ii) Mathematics and their Technologies, (iii) Natural
Sciences and their Technologies and (iv) Human Sciences and their
Technologies and (v) Writing; and personal data (iv) age, (v) sex and
(vi) completed high school in a public or private school. Six models
showed independence, cons-tant variance, absence of influential and
significant outliers, allowing for an excellent predictive capacity of
student performance.},

 abstract = {Students learning performance is one of the core components for
assessing any educational systems. Students performance is very crucial
in tackling issues of learning process and one of the important matters
to measure learning outcomes. The ability to use data knowledge to
improve education systems has led to the development of the field of
research known as educational data mining (EDM). EDM is the creation of
techniques to investigate data gathered from educational settings,
allowing for a more thorough and accurate understanding of students and
the improvement of educational outcomes for them. The use of machine
learning (ML) technology has increased significantly in recent years.
Researchers and teachers can use the measurements of success, failure,
dropout, and more provided by the discipline of data mining in education
to predict and simulate education processes. Therefore, this work
presents an analysis of students performance using data mining methods.
The paper presents both clustering and classification techniques to
identify the impact of students performance at early stage with on the
GPA. For the clustering technique, the paper uses dimensionality
reduction mechanism by T-SNE algorithm with various factors at early
stage such as admission scores and first level courses, academic
achievement tests (AAT) and general aptitude tests (GAT) in order to
explore the relationship between these factors and GPA's. For the
classification technique, the paper presents experiments on different
machine learning models on predicting student performance at early
stages using different features including courses' grades and admission
tests' scores. We use different assessment metrics to evaluate the
quality of the models. The results suggest that educational systems can
mitigate the risks of students failures at the early stages.},

 abstract = {Recently, data mining approaches have been widely used to estimate
student performance in online education. Various machine learning (ML)
based data mining techniques have been developed to evaluate student
performance accurately. However, they face specific issues in
implementation. Hence, a novel hybrid Elman neural with apriori mining
(ENAM) approach was presented in this article to predict student
performance in online education. The designed model was validated with
the student's performance dataset. Incorporating the Elman neural system
eliminates the noise data present in dataset. Moreover, meaningful
features are extracted in feature analysis and trained to the system.
Then, the student performances are sorted based on their average score
and classified as good, bad, or average. In addition, a case study was
developed to describe the working of the designed model. The presented
approach was executed in python software, and performance metrics are
estimated. Moreover, a comparative analysis was performed to prove that
the proposed system earned better outcomes than existing approaches.},

 abstract = {The process of learning about a student's knowledge and comprehension of
a particular subject is referred to as student knowledge assessment. It
helps to identify areas where students need additional support or
challenge and can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of instruction,
make important decisions such as on student placement and curriculum
development, and monitor the quality of education. Evaluating student
knowledge assessment is essential to measuring student progress,
informing instruction, and providing feedback to improve student
performance and enhance the overall teaching and learning experience.
This research paper is designed to create a machine learning (ML)-based
system that assesses student performance and knowledge throughout the
course of their studies and pinpoints the key variables that have the
most significant effects on that performance and expertise.
Additionally, it describes the impact of running models with data that
only contains key features on their performance. To classify the
students, the paper employs seven different classifiers, including
support vector machines (SVM), logistic regression (LR), random forest
(RF), decision tree (DT), gradient boosting machine (GBM), Gaussian
Naive Bayes (GNB), and multi-layer perceptron (MLP). This paper carries
out two experiments to see how best to replicate the automatic
classification of student knowledge. In the first experiment, the
dataset (Dataset 1) was used in its original state, including all five
properties listed in the dataset, to evaluate the performance
indicators. In the second experiment, the least correlated variable was
removed from the dataset to create a smaller dataset (Dataset 2), and
the same set of performance indicators was evaluated. Then, the
performance indicators using Dataset 1 and Dataset 2 were compared. The
GBM exhibited the highest prediction accuracy of 98\%, according to
Dataset 1. In terms of prediction error, the GBM also performed well.
The accuracy of optimistic forecasts on student performance, denoted as
the performance indicator `precision', was highest in GBM at 99\%, while
DT, RF, and SVM were 98\% accurate in their optimistic forecasts for
Dataset 1. The second experiment's findings demonstrated that
practically no classifiers showed appreciable improvements in prediction
accuracy with a reduced feature set in Dataset 2. It showed that the
time required for related learning objects and the knowledge level
corresponding to a goal learning object have less impact.},

 abstract = {Evaluating students' academic performance is crucial for assessing the
quality of education and educational strategies. However, it can be
challenging to predict and evaluate academic performance under uncertain
and imprecise conditions. To address this issue, many research works
have employed fuzzy concepts to analyze, predict, and make decisions
about students' academic performance. This paper investigates the use of
fuzzy concepts in research related to evaluating, analyzing, predicting,
or making decisions about student academic performance. The paper
proposes a fuzzy model, called FPM (Fuzzy Propositional Model), for
reasoning and predicting students' academic performance. FPM aims to
address the limitations of previous studies by incorporating
propositional logic with fuzzy sets concept, which allows for the
representation of uncertainty and imprecision in the data. FPM
integrates and transforms if-then rules into weighted fuzzy production
rules to predict and evaluate academic performance. This paper tests and
evaluates the FPM in two scenarios. In the first scenario, the model
predicts and examines the impact of absenteeism on academic performance
where there is no clear relation between the two parts of the dataset.
In the second scenario, the model predicts the final exam results using
the lab exam results, where the data are more related. The FPM provides
good results in both scenarios, demonstrating its effectiveness in
predicting and evaluating students' academic performance. A comparison
study of the FPM's results with a linear regression model and previous
work showed that the FPM performs better in predicting academic
performance and provides more insights into the underlying factors
affecting it. Therefore, the FPM could be useful in educational
institutions to predict and evaluate students' academic performance,
identify underlying factors affecting it, and improve educational
strategies.},

 abstract = {The application of intelligent systems in the higher education sector is
an active field of research, powered by the abundance of available data
and by the urgency to define effective, data-driven strategies to
overcome students' dropout and improve students' academic performance.
This work applies machine learning techniques to develop prediction
models that can contribute to the early detection of students at risk of
dropping out or not finishing their degree in due time. It also
evaluates the best moment for performing the prediction along the
student's enrollment year. The models are built on data of undergraduate
students from a Polytechnic University in Portugal, enrolled between
2009 and 2017, comprising academic, social-demographic, and
macroeconomic information at three different phases during the first
academic year of the students. Five machine learning algorithms are used
to train prediction models at each phase, and the most relevant features
for the top performing models are identified. Results show that the best
models use Random Forest, either incorporating strategies to deal with
the imbalanced nature of the data or using such strategies at the data
level. The best results are obtained at the end of the first semester,
when some information about the academic performance after enrollment is
already available. The overall results compare fairly with some similar
works that address the early prediction of students' dropout or academic
performance.},

 abstract = {In higher education, student learning relies increasingly on autonomy.
With the rise in blended learning, both online and offline, students
need to further improve their online learning effectiveness. Therefore,
predicting students' performance and identifying students who are
struggling in real time to intervene is an important way to improve
learning outcomes. However, currently, machine learning in grade
prediction applications typically only employs a single-output
prediction method and has lagging issues. To advance the prediction of
time and enhance the predictive attributes, as well as address the
aforementioned issues, this study proposes a multi-output hybrid
ensemble model that utilizes data from the Superstar Learning
Communication Platform (SLCP) to predict grades. Experimental results
show that using the first six weeks of SLCP data and the Xgboost model
to predict mid-term and final grades meant that accuracy reached
78.37\%, which was 3-8\% higher than the comparison models. Using the
Gdbt model to predict homework and experiment grades, the average mean
squared error was 16.76, which is better than the comparison models.
This study uses a multi-output hybrid ensemble model to predict how
grades can help improve student learning quality and teacher teaching
effectiveness.},

 abstract = {Stress is correlated with various illnesses that include diabetes,
depression, and other chronic diseases and plays an important role in
the emotional and physical well-being. In past years, number of student
dropout from educational institute is rapidly maximizing. However, high
rate of student dropout has been a major issue in various institutions.
Dropout and stress prediction has received more attention in recent
years. Previous literature studies applied machine learning algorithms
to recognize the dropout and stress level of students, but there exist
an issue of low accuracy and it leads to misidentification at learners.
To overcome such problems and to create more accurate prediction result,
a proposed method named Adaptive Chicken Squirrel Search Algorithm on
the basis of Deep Belief Network (Adaptive-CSSA based DBN) is developed
to predict the dropout and stress level of students based on the student
performance behavior. The proposed prediction mechanism is designed with
MapReduce framework by considering the mapper and the reducer functions.
Here, the feature selection strategy is employed to select the unique
features from student data that contains detailed information of
students. Moreover, the proposed technique attained minimum MSE, RMSE,
and MAPE as 0.025, 0.157, and 0.126 for dropout prediction and obtained
lower MSE, RMSE, and MAPE value of 0.150, 0.387, and 0.326 for stress
level prediction with student performance dataset.},

 abstract = {Learning Analytics aims to discover the class of students' performance
over time. This helps in-structors make in-time interventions but,
discovering the students' performance class in virtual learning
environments consider a challenge due to distance constraints. Many
studies, which applied to Massive Open Online Courses (MOOC) datasets,
built predictive models but, these models were applied to specific
courses and students and classify students into binary classes.
Moreover, their results were obtained at the end of the course period
thus delaying making in -time interventions. To bridge this gap, this
study proposes a day-wise multi-class model to pre-dict students'
performance using Artificial Neural Network and Long Short-Term Memory,
named ANN-LSTM. To check the validity of this model, two baseline
models, the Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Gated Recurrent Unit
(GRU), were conducted and compared with ANN-LSTM in this context.
Additionally, the results of ANN-LSTM were compared with the
state-of-the-art models in terms of accuracy. The results show that the
ANN-LSTM model obtained the best re-sults among baseline models. The
accuracy obtained by ANN-LSTM was about 70\% at the end of the third
month of the course and outperforms RNN and GRU models which obtained
53\% and 57\%, respectively. Also, the ANN-LSTM model obtained the best
accuracy results with enhancement rates of about 6-14\% when compared
with state-of-the-art models. This highlights the ability of LSTM as a
time series model to make early predictions for student performance in
MOOC taking benefit of its architecture and ability to keep latent
dependencies.},

 abstract = {This study proposes models for searching and recommending learning
resources to meet the needs of learners, helping to achieve better
student performance results. The study suggests a general architecture
for searching and recommending learning resources. It specifically
proposes (1) the model of learning resource classification based on deep
learning techniques such as MLP; (2) the approach for searching learning
resources based on document similarity; (3) the model to predict
learning performance using deep learning techniques including learning
performance prediction model on all student data using CNN, another
model on ability group using MLP, and the other model on per student
using LSTM; (4) the learning resource recommendation model using deep
matrix factorization. Experimental results show that the proposed models
are feasible for the classification, search, ranking prediction, and
recommendation of learning resources in higher education institutions.},

 abstract = {In the education domain, predicting the academic performance of students
has become an essential task to improve learning outcomes. In this
study, we propose a Modified XGBoost (MXGB) model for predicting student
performance using stream-based analysis of the dataset. We used a
modified version of the XGBoost algorithm using cross-validation, which
incorporates stream-based analysis to enhance its performance on
real-time data. We preprocessed the dataset and applied feature
engineering techniques to extract relevant features for building the
model. We trained the MXGB model on the preprocessed dataset and
evaluated its performance using various metrics such as accuracy,
precision, sensitivity, and F1-score. The results show that our model
outperforms the baseline XGBoost model and achieves high accuracy in
predicting the student's academic performance. Our model can assist
educational institutions in identifying students who are at risk of
performing poorly and providing them with timely intervention to improve
their academic outcomes.},

 abstract = {Today, educational institutions produce large amounts of data with the
deployment of learning management systems. These large datasets provide
an untapped potential to support and enhance decision-making and
operations. In recent times, machine learning (ML) has been applied to
develop models utilizing this ``big{''} data to assist in
decision-making. This study presents a systematic literature review into
the application of ML to predict student performance. A total of 162
research articles from January 2010 to October 2022 were critically
reviewed and analyzed by applying Kitchenham's systematic literature
review approach. Our analysis categorized the literature predicting
students' academic performance into two categories: (i) predicting
student performance in assessments, courses or programs, and identifying
students at-risk of failing their course/program (129 studies); and (ii)
predicting student dropout or retention in a course or program (33
studies). Classification is the most commonly used approach for
predicting student performance (138 studies), followed by regression (25
studies) and clustering (9 studies). Supervised learning methods are
used more often than semi-supervised learning. Five most popular ML
algorithms include the Decision Tree, Random Forest, Naive Bayes,
Artificial Neural Network, and Support Vector Machine. Historical
records of students' grades and class performance, academic related data
from learning management systems, and students' demographics are the
most common features used for predicting students' performance. The most
common methods used for feature selection are Information Gain-based
selection algorithms, Correlation-based feature selection, and Gain
Ratio. The general platforms/tools/libraries used in the studies include
WEKA, Python, R, Rapid Miner, and MATLAB. We also investigated possible
actions considered in the literature to help at-risk students. We only
found very few studies that deployed remedial actions and evaluated
their impact on students' performance. In conclusion, ML has shown great
potential in the prediction of student performance, but also has many
areas of further research.},

 abstract = {E-learning is fast becoming an integral part of the teaching-learning
process, particularly after the outbreak of Covid-19 pandemic.
Educational institutions across the globe are striving to enhance their
e-learning instruc-tional mechanism in accordance with the aspirations
of present-day students who are widely using numerous technological
tools - computers, tablets, mobiles, and Internet for educational
purposes. In the wake of the evident incorporation of e-learning into
the educational process, research related to the application of
Educa-tional Data Mining (EDM) techniques for enhancing e-learning
systems has gained significance in recent times. The various data mining
techniques applied by researchers to study hidden trends or patterns in
educational data can provide valuable insights for educational
institutions in terms of making the learning process adaptive to student
needs. The insights can help the institutions achieve their ultimate
goal of improving student academic performance in technology-assisted
learning systems of the modern world. This review paper aims to
compre-hend EDM's role in enhancing e-learning environments with
reference to commonly-used techniques, along with student performance
prediction, the impact of Covid-19 pandemic on e-learning and priority
e-learning focus areas in the future.},

 abstract = {Machine learning in Education is receiving more attention from
researchers as the number of students at all levels globally is
increasing. To ensure students' success in K-12 educational institutions
and higher education institutions work needs to be done to assist
students, teachers/professors, parents, and all stakeholders to provide
the support that students need. The need and motivation for such systems
are very well-established and thus the aim of this work is to develop a
system based on modified machine learning models to automatically
predict students' performance and subsequently identify students at
risk. The DEEDs dataset is used in this study. Novel features were
extracted and applied to well-known classifiers some of which are
ensemble classifiers. These classifiers were also combined with base
learners such as bagging and boosting. The problem was divided into
three scenarios; binary classification of the pass and fail, three class
scenarios, and four class scenarios. It was shown that ensemble methods
combined with base learners of boosting and bagging significantly
increase the accuracy for binary classification, slightly increase
accuracy for three class problems, and have no significance in
increasing the accuracy when the problem is 4 classes. The ensemble
algorithm of bagging and boosting FDT achieved an accuracy of 98.25\%
for binary classification and 89.47\% for three classes. The standard
ensemble FDT achieved an accuracy of 77.19\% for four classes. The
results obtained for binary classification were compared with results
reported in the extant literature using the same dataset proving that
the proposed modified algorithms achieved better results than similarly
proposed methods. The three-class and four-class results could not be
compared because according to the author's knowledge, there are no
research papers published for the same dataset for multi-class
classification.},

 abstract = {Predicting academic performance for students majoring in computer
science has long been a significant field of research in computing
education. Previous studies described that accurate prediction of
students' early-stage performance could identify low-performing students
and take corrective action to improve performance. Besides, adopting
machine learning algorithms with predictive analytics has proven
possible and meaningful. The traditional approach of looking after
students without uncovering the root causes of poor performance has
shifted dramatically into improving the quality of the educational
processes of students, teachers, and stakeholders. Thus, this study
employed predictive analytics to develop an early warning prediction
model using computing science degree performance data at a public
institution. Predictive models based on our data analysis revealed that
low, medium, and high-performing students could be predicted with an
accuracy of 88\% using only the grades of the courses they took in the
second year. Moreover, 96\% accuracy was achieved when all course grades
were used in predictive models. The courses that are important in
determining the overall performance of the students were also analyzed.
By employing a multi-method approach, utilizing a large dataset spanning
four academic years, and including a diverse sample of 430 students, our
study offers a robust foundation to researchers, designers, and computer
science educators for understanding and predicting student performance.
The enhanced generalizability and implications for educational practice
position our study as a valuable contribution to the field, paving the
way for further advancements in predictive analytics.},

 abstract = {Knowing the potential students who will fail the final exam at early
stages is very challenging but important for the decision-makers in the
educational institutions to take proper actions to prevent them from
failure. To accurately predict the secondary school student performance,
we propose a double particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based categorical
boosting (P2CatBoost) model based on the demographic, school period
grades, and social/school related features. Considering the machine
learning models are sensitive to their hyper-parameter settings, we
introduce the PSO to optimize the fitness function. In addition, the
threshold of a standard binary classification task is 0.5, which might
not be the optimal value in real-world applications. Thus, we optimize
this threshold by the PSO. To evaluate the performance of our proposed
model, two datasets downloaded from the University of California, Irvine
Repository and the Kaggle, respectively, are used. The experimental
results showed that our proposed P2CatBoost has the best performance in
terms of all the metrics used. Our proposed P2CatBoost has the best
accuracy of 96.62\% and 94.45\% for the final grade prediction of the
Mathematics and Portuguese courses, respectively. In addition, our
proposed model outperforms the other models under comparison from 4.5\%
to 8.3\%. The statistical analyses verify that our P2CatBoost can
significantly outperform the comparing models. These results confirm the
effectiveness of our double PSO for improving the performance of student
performance prediction, indicating our proposed model could be a useful
tool in educational institutions to improve the quality of education.},

 abstract = {Knowledge tracing (KT) is the task of tracing students' evolving
knowledge state during learning, which has improved the learning
efficiency. To facilitate KT's development, most existing methods pursue
high accuracy of student performance prediction but neglect the
consistency between students' dynamic knowledge state with their
learning process. Moreover, they focus on learning outcomes at a single
learning interaction, while student progress at continuous learning
interactions is more instructive. In this paper, we explore a new
paradigm for the KT task and propose a novel model named Learning
Process-consistent Knowledge Tracing (LPKT), which captures the
evolution of students' knowledge state through monitoring their learning
progress. Specifically, we utilize both the positive effect of the
learning gain and the negative effect of forgetting in learning to
calculate student progress in continuous learning interactions. Then,
considering that the rate of progress is student-specific, we extend
LPKT to LPKT-S by explicitly distinguishing the individual progress rate
of each student. Extensive experimental results on three public datasets
demonstrate that LPKT and LPKT-S could obtain more appropriate knowledge
states in line with the learning process. Moreover, LPKT and LPKT-S
outperform state-of-the-art KT methods on student performance
prediction. Our work indicates a promising future research direction for
KT, which is highly interpretable and accurate.},

 abstract = {Increasing productivity in educational systems is of great imprtance.
Researchers are keen to predict the academic performance of students;
this is done to enhance the overall productivity of educational system
by effectively identifying students whose performance is below average.
This universal concern has been combined with data science leading to
the creation of an interdisciplinary research area called Educational
Data Mining. One of the recent issues which has been addressed by
researchers is training generalizable models from different aspects such
as gender, major, geography and etc. Therefore, in this research we use
machine learning methods to predict student's performance, emphasizing
on training generalizable models from geographical aspect. For this
purpose, a questionnaire containing 37 questions was designed, through
which 536 answers were collected, including 111 international and 425
domestic answers. According to the literature, student performance is
mostly determined based on the GPA (grade point average) of the entire
course. In this research, information about the GPA of respondents in
undergraduate and graduate courses was collected in the form of three
classes. After a final review of the models employed in previous
studies, the main models selected and used for classification purposes
included SVM, CNN, Adaboost, RF, SVM, and DT. Feature selection is
performed using XGBoost, random forest, as well as SVML1. The main issue
investigated in this study is the generalizability of the models trained
on domestic (iranian) data and tested on international data
(non-iranian). Experimental results show that the best models trained
with specific dataset collected in this research had generalizability
comparing to base models' outcomes which were trained and tested on
domestic data. Meanwhile, Random forest and CNN models shows the best
performance with the average of accuracy and F-score of 73.5 and 68.5,
respectively.},

 abstract = {Cooperative learning is a pedagogical approach in which students
collaborate in small groups to attain a shared academic objective. In
the classroom, cooperative learning aims to enhance learning outcomes by
promoting the exchange of information, social, and personal resources
among students. Group formation is a critical and complex step that
significantly impacts the effectiveness of cooperative learning. In this
article, we propose a novel approach for constructing cooperative
learning groups that employs machine learning to predict student
performance and incorporates the most common grouping strategies to
recommend optimal group formation.},

 abstract = {In the last few decades, technological improvements have had a
considerable impact on education, much like many other fields of society
and human endeavor. The applications of today's cutting-edge technology
are numerous in education, but recently researchers focused on using
these technologies, especially artificial intelligence (AI) and machine
learning (ML), for students' performance prediction prior to the exam.
It makes perfect sense to forecast student success to help all
participants in the educational process. Student performance prediction
may assist them in the selection of suitable courses and in creating
their academic schedules. Keeping in mind the importance of student
performance evaluation, this paper analyzes the prediction rate of
college English level 4 by using one of the powerful ML algorithms
called random forest (RF). RF uses numerous classifiers, or
``ensembles{''}, rather than just one classifier, and is based on the
decision tree technique. To do this, we constructed input and output
variables and collected data for these variables, including basic
student information (gender, ethnicity, major), English scores on
college admission exams, college English scores (total of four
semesters), and extracurricular activities of college students.
Preprocessing was performed on the collected data, which included the
removal of unnecessary attributes, handling outliers, normalization, and
data cleaning. After the preprocessing, the features were extracted and
transformed into reduced dimensionality by the local-preserving
projection (LPP) algorithm. From the extracted features, we selected
only the most relevant in order to feed them as input to the RF model.
The model is implemented in MATLAB in order to evaluate its performance.
The efficiency of the proposed model is evaluated with the help of
experiments in order to verify the effectiveness of the model. The
performance of the RF algorithm-based college English IV pass rate
prediction model is evaluated by computing the prediction accuracy,
recall rate, and hit rate of the classification results. We achieved a
prediction accuracy of 96.5\%, a recall rate of 89.5\%, and a hit rate
of 93.3\%. The results show that the random RF-based prediction model
for college English level 4 has a good classification effect and that
the prediction results are more accurate.},

 abstract = {Educational Data Mining (EDM) is gaining great importance as a new
interdisciplinary research field related to some other areas. It is
directly related to data mining (DM), the latter being a fundamental
part of knowledge discovery in databases (KDD). This data is growing
more and more and contains hidden knowledge that could be very useful
for users (both teachers and students). It is convenient to identify
such knowledge in the form of models, patterns, or any other
representation scheme that allows better exploitation of the system.
Data mining is revealed as the tool to achieve such discovery, giving
rise to EDM. In this complex context, different techniques and learning
algorithms are usually used to obtain the best results. Recently
educational systems are adopting artificial intelligent systems,
especially in the educational context, specific areas for extracting
relevant information, such as EDM, which integrates numerous techniques
that support the capture, processing, and analysis of these sets of
records. The main technique associated with EDM is Machine Learning,
which has been used for decades in data processing in different
contexts, but with the advent of Big Data, there was an intensification
in the application of this technique to extract relevant information
from a huge amount of data. This paper proposes the student performance
prediction using CNN (Convolution Neural Network) and BPSO (Binary
Particle Swarm Optimization) based feature selection method. In this
study, classifiers are made for 2-class and 5-class predictions. The
proposed system claims an outperforming accuracy of 96.6\% with various
previous research works as well as found that the majority of attributes
related to school activities as compared to data on demographic and
socioeconomic characteristics. (c) 2022 The Authors. Published by IASE.

 abstract = {Educational data mining has attracted significant consideration over the
last few years. Information that is stored online using educational
systems is increasing tremendously. The online learning environment can
be improved by analysing and mining this information to extract
representative features about students' behaviour and academic skills.
Various classifiers are investigated to analyse the prediction of
students' academic performance based on the attributes from the
Kalboard360 learning management system (LMS). The selection of
significant features can substantially improve the prediction, hence,
ANOVA and Chi-square filter approaches and forward feature selection and
backward feature elimination wrapper approaches are examined for their
efficacy. Results reveal that an extra tree classifier can achieve an
accuracy of 0.8755 when trained on backward feature elimination selected
features. Wrapper approaches prove to be effective in determining the
most significant attributes for student performance prediction. `Visited
resources', `raised hands', `relation', `parent answering survey', and
`student absent days' are regarded as the most significant attributes to
determine student performance. Education specialists and institutions
can leverage these findings to improve the student learning process and
enhance their academic performance.},

 abstract = {Predicting student performance is a crucial research area in educational
data mining. Student grades are influenced by various factors such as
past academic performance, family background, and personal achievements.
However, it is difficult to collect many relevant factors other than
past academic performance, and it is not ideal to predict student
performance using past academic records alone. Therefore, reducing the
difficulty of data collection while maintaining timeliness and
prediction accuracy remains a pressing issue. To address this challenge,
this study proposes a novel model for predicting university student
performance based on multi-feature fusion and attention mechanisms. The
proposed model focuses on analyzing historical academic grades from
multiple dimensions among university students to extract features that
reveal relationships between courses and students, among different
students themselves, or even between courses themselves. Additionally,
an attention mechanism is introduced to explore the relationship between
different dimensional features. This study collected a triplet set of
related courses and students' real historical grades, proved the
correlation between courses through data analysis, and verified the
effectiveness of different dimensional features. Experimental results
show that, compared with traditional machine learning methods, our
proposed method achieves better prediction accuracy with a precision
rate of 72.5\%.},

 abstract = {The purpose of this work is to analyze data from the learning platform
Moodle to predict the academic performance of the student in Programming
class course. We used six machine learning classification techniques to
extract a pattern from student Moodle using two datasets. In the first
dataset, grade is in binary categorization (pass/fail), and in the
second dataset grade is in a three-level categorization (fail, good and
excellent). The research applies all possible combinations of eleven
features for the selection of best predicting features, so we examined a
total of 24432 prediction models on both datasets. The results show that
Logistic Regression obtained the best results on binary dataset and
Random Forests obtained the best results on three-level grade
categorization, in terms of accuracy, precision and recall. We showed
how the same classifiers on different features can give very similar
results. In other words, there is no single best prediction model that
significantly outperforms the others, but there are several very similar
models that differ in the number of features selected and the selected
classifier.},

 abstract = {With the development of information technology construction in schools,
predicting student grades has become a hot area of application in
current educational research. Using data mining to analyze the
influencing factors of students' performance and predict their grades
can help students identify their shortcomings, optimize teachers'
teaching methods and enable parents to guide their children's progress.
However, there are no models that can achieve satisfactory predictions
for education-related public datasets, and most of these weakly
correlated factors in the datasets can still adversely affect the
predictive effect of the model. To solve this issue and provide
effective policy recommendations for the modernization of education,
this paper seeks to find the best grade prediction model based on data
mining. Firstly, the study uses the Factor Analyze (FA) model to extract
features from the original data and achieve dimension reduction. Then,
the Bidirectional Gate Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) model and attention
mechanism are utilized to predict grades. Lastly, Comparing the
prediction results of ablation experiments and other single models, such
as linear regression (LR), back propagation neural network (BP), random
forest (RF), and Gate Recurrent Unit (GRU), the FA-BiGRU-attention model
achieves the best prediction effect and performs equally well in
different multi-step predictions. Previously, problems with students'
grades were only detected when they had already appeared. However, the
methods presented in this paper enable the prediction of students'
learning in advance and the identification of factors affecting their
grades. Therefore, this study has great potential to provide data
support for the improvement of educational programs, transform the
traditional education industry, and ensure the sustainable development
of national talents.},

 abstract = {Many stakeholders including students, teachers, and educational
institutions, benefit from accurately predicting student performance and
facilitating data-driven policies. In this field, providing users with
accurate and understandable predictions is challenging, but equally
important. The goals of this study are multifaceted: to identify
students at-risk; to identify differences in assessment across different
environments; methods for assessing students; and to determine the
relationship between teacher employment status and student achievement.
This study performs an empirical comparison of the performance and
efficiency of ensemble classification methods based on bagging,
boosting, stacking, and voting for successful predictions. An ensemble
model is developed and validated using double, triple, and quadruple
combinations of classification algorithms using Naive Bayes, J48
decision trees, Adaboost, logistics, and multilayer perceptron. This
study uses primary quantitative data from the learning management system
of a university in Pakistan to analyze the performance of these models.
The boosted tree detection method outperforms bagged trees when the
standard deviation is higher and the data size is large, while stacking
is best for smaller datasets. Based on behavioral analysis results of
students, academic advice can be given for selected case studies. These
will help educational administrators and policymakers working in
education to introduce new policies and curricula accordingly.},

 abstract = {Predicting student performance is crucial for improving students' future
academic achievements. Within student groups, common characteristics can
reveal trends in overall student learning. Most studies tend to focus on
the common characteristics of students but ignore their individual
characteristics. However, individual characteristics are important in
promoting student academic performance because they allow us to
understand the unique learning performances of each student. To address
this issue, this paper proposes a student performance prediction
approach. First, addressing the problem of difficulty in effectively
dividing the student samples under multi-dimensional discrete data, we
propose a method that combines the relationship matrix-based bipartite
network approach (RMBN) with Louvain clustering. Second, the hybrid
neural network model based on a relationship matrix (RMHNN) is proposed
to address the problem that discrete types of features are difficult to
fit by algorithms. The results show that the implementation of the model
on real student data can effectively predict student performance with an
accuracy of 93.1\% and an F1-score of 90.45\%. With the model's
predicted student performance, educators can provide individualized
support and assistance to each student.},

 abstract = {With the COVID-19 outbreak, schools and universities have massively
adopted online learning to ensure the continuation of the learning
process. However, in such setting, instructors lack efficient mechanisms
to evaluate the learning gains and get insights about difficulties
learners encounter. In this research work, we tackle the problem of
predicting learner performance in online learning using a deep
learning-based approach. Our proposed solution allows stakeholders
involved in the online learning to anticipate the learner outcome ahead
of the final assessment hence offering the opportunity for proactive
measures to assist the learners. We propose a two-pathway deep learning
model to classify learner performance using their interaction during the
online sessions in the form of clickstreams. We also propose to
transform these time series of clicks into images using the Gramian
Angular Field. The learning model makes use of the available extra
demographic and assessment information. We evaluate our approach on the
Open University Learning Analytics Dataset. Comprehensive comparative
study is conducted with evaluation against state-of-art approaches under
different experimental settings. We also demonstrate the importance of
including extra demographic and assessment data in the prediction
process.},

 abstract = {Predicting student performance automatically is of utmost importance,
due to the substantial volume of data within educational databases.
Educational data mining (EDM) devises techniques to uncover insights
from data originating in educational settings. Artificial intelligence
(AI) can mine educational data to predict student performance and
provide measures to help students avoid failing and learn better.
Learning platforms complement traditional learning settings by analyzing
student performance, which can help reduce the chance of student
failure. Existing methods for student performance prediction in
educational data mining faced challenges such as limited accuracy,
imbalanced data, and difficulties in feature engineering. These issues
hindered effective adaptability and generalization across diverse
educational contexts. This study proposes a machine learning-based
system with deep convoluted features for the prediction of students'
academic performance. The proposed framework is employed to predict
student academic performance using balanced as well as, imbalanced
datasets using the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). In
addition, the performance is also evaluated using the original and deep
convoluted features. Experimental results indicate that the use of deep
convoluted features provides improved prediction accuracy compared to
original features. Results obtained using the extra tree classifier with
convoluted features show the highest classification accuracy of 99.9\%.
In comparison with the state-of-the-art approaches, the proposed
approach achieved higher performance. This research introduces a
powerful AI-driven system for student performance prediction, offering
substantial advancements in accuracy compared to existing approaches.},

 abstract = {In the profession of education, predicting students' academic success is
an essential responsibility. This study introduces a novel methodology
for predicting students' pass or fail outcome in certain courses. The
system utilises academic, demographic, emotional, and VLE sequence
information of students. Traditional prediction methods often struggle
to capture the temporal dynamics inherent in student data, such as
learning trajectories, study habits, and evolving performance patterns.
In response, this research leverages Recurrent Neural Network (RNNs) and
Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) network (LSTMs), which are specifically
designed to model sequences and long-term dependencies from OULAD and
self-generated Emotional dataset. By incorporating these architectures,
the proposed methodology excels in capturing the intricate relationships
between various factors over time. Further, various ML models such as
Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes (NB) and
Decision Tree (DT) are integrated with RNN + LSTM to enhance the
predictive power of model. The proposed system with RNN + LSTM + RF
techniques gained approximately 97\% accuracy that is comparatively
higher than RNN + LSTM + SVM, RNN + LSTM + NB and RNN + LSTM + DT i.e.,
90.67\%, 86.45\% \& 84.42\% respectively.},

 abstract = {The prediction of final semester grades is a crucial undertaking in
education, offering insights into student performance and enabling
timely interventions to support their academic journey. This paper
employs a deep learning approach, specifically gated recurrent unit
(GRU), in conjunction with feature optimization using analysis of
variance (ANOVA), to forecast final semester grades. The predictive
model is trained and evaluated on a handcrafted grade prediction
dataset, which contains the academic performance of the students during
Plus 2 and from Semester 1 to Semester 4 of a group of Computer science
and Engineering majors in Kerala. By processing historical academic
records and contextual information, the GRU model learns to predict
future performance accurately. To enhance the model's efficacy and
interpretability, ANOVA is applied to optimize the feature selection
process. This statistical technique identifies the most influential
factors contributing to final grades, refining the model's predictive
power while reducing dimensionality. The experimental results showcase
the model's effectiveness in predicting final semester grades,
demonstrating superior accuracy and performance compared to grade
prediction using CNN with Bayesian optimization and LSTM with L1-Norm
optimization.},

 abstract = {In the era of big data, the traditional governance model of student
behavior management gradually shows the disadvantage of ``post
positioning{''}. Therefore, the research uses relevant data mining
algorithms to extract and analyze students' behavior characteristics,
and constructs a SPC system model for students' behavior analysis and
performance prediction. At the same time, the experiment verifies its
effectiveness. The experimental results show that in the factor
analysis, the overall variance of the first seven indicators is
69.942\%, which shows that there is a significant correlation between
students' learning behavior and academic performance. In the model
performance analysis of SPC system, the accuracy of the five algorithms
is kept at 40\% - 60\%, while SVM has higher stability than other
methods. In addition, the prediction accuracy and response rate of SPC
model reached 86.90\% and 81.57\% respectively. When the sequence length
was increased from 1 to 20, the accuracy of SPC model exceeded 70\%;
However, when the feature dimension exceeds 50, the model representation
ability will decline. Therefore, appropriate feature dimensions are
needed to predict student performance. To sum up, the SPC model built by
the research is effective in analyzing student behavior and predicting
students' performance, and practical in actual student management.},

 abstract = {For scholarly organizations, students' academic performance (AP)
computes student achievements in different academic subjects. Therefore,
a systematic literature review based on machine learning approaches to
improve student performance is proposed. This field creates a way to
discover hidden examples from instructive information. Machine learning
(ML) techniques are used for performance prediction. It is become a
challenge due to its imbalanced dataset. This review aims to identify
the best proposals that focus on various ML methods used for the
performance analysis of students. This review will become helpful to the
teachers in identifying the weak students, and it helps to improve their
performance through proper guidance. Thus, it reflects in the student's
background and boosts their growth. It also brings benefits to students,
teachers, and institutions. This study focused on applying machine
learning techniques to predict students' performance in recent times.
With a systematic approach, the research identified the existing
prediction methods and tools used to predict students' performance and
observed the researchers' type of variables in this research area. In
this study, almost more than 100 papers were analyzed to reveal various
modern techniques that are commonly used to predict student performance
and the goals they need to achieve in this field. The results from the
various research will help improve students' academics and monitor the
student's performance, which would also improve their literacy rate.},

 abstract = {Although the modern education system is highly developed, educators have
never stopped looking for new ways to improve it. After entering the
21st century, more and more educational data are stored, and data mining
techniques have developed rapidly. Educational data mining has become a
hot topic for educators who want to discover the information hiding
among educational data. As a sub-branch of educational data mining,
student performance prediction aims to predict student performance based
on student datasets. This research attempts to improve the performance
of predictive algorithms on a 5-level student performance grading
system. This research changes the prediction method from a
classification approach to a regression approach and enlarges small
datasets with synthetic data. Algorithms including Support Vector
Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), Neural Network (NN), and Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs) are used in this research. From the results
obtained, it is concluded that the regression approach outperforms the
classification approach in predicting student performance. The
classification approach is currently widely used in student performance
prediction. This research also explores the possibility of using
synthetic student data to augment small educational datasets. The course
and evaluation system differ among different regions, making student
data hard to collect or merge. Augmenting small student datasets with
synthetic data may help educators to better evaluate their teaching
skills. This research shows that a regression approach using synthetic
data improves the prediction accuracy by up to 21.9\%, 15.6\%, and
6.6\%, respectively, using SVM, NN, and RF.},

 abstract = {Deaf and Hard of Hearing (DHH) students encounter obstacles in higher
education due to language and communication challenges. Although
research aims to improve their academic performance, the potential of
Machine Learning (ML) remains underutilized in DHH education. The
opacity of ML models further complicates their adoption. This study aims
to fill this gap by developing a novel ML-based system with eXplainable
AI (XAI), specifically utilizing Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic
Explainer (LIME) and Shapley Additive Explainer (SHAP). The objective is
twofold: predicting at-risk DHH students and explaining risk factors.
Merging ML and XAI, this approach could positively impact DHH students'
educational outcomes. A dataset of 454 records detailing DHH students is
collected. To address dataset limitations, synthetic data and SMOTE are
used. Students are categorized into three performance levels. The data
is modeled with different ML models, transfer models, ensemble models,
and combination models. Among the models, the stacked model with
XGBoost, ExtraTrees, and Random Forest exhibited better performance with
an accuracy of 92.99\%. Results highlight the model's significance,
providing insights through XAI into crucial factors affecting academic
performance, including communication mode, early intervention, schooling
type, and family deafness history. LIME and SHAP values were found to be
effective in deriving insights into DHH student performance prediction
framework. Communication mode, notably, strongly influences at-risk
students. The major contribution of this study is the development of a
novel ML-based system and the XAI interpretations whose value lies in
its social relevance, guiding stakeholders to enhance DHH scholars'
academic achievements.},

 abstract = {Based on student's cognitive structure, the cognitive diagnostic models
(CDMs) can reveal the potential relationships among the student's
knowledge level, test item features and the corresponding item scores,
and then predict each student's future performance. However, due to the
simplistic prior information and deficient cognitive mechanism, most of
the existing CDMs have limited prediction performance. To address the
issues, we propose the multivariate cognitive response framework
(MvCRF). We first collect student's learning activity logs to calculate
the corresponding effort trait. Considering both student's ability trait
and effort trait, MvCRF then introduces the compensation mechanism to
calculate student's knowledge level. In addition, we introduce not only
the slip and guessing parameters in prediction but also the skill
weakness parameter related with the student's knowledge level and the
importance of each skill on solving specific item. Experimental results
on both simulation study and real-data application on MOOC demonstrate
that MvCRF achieves better prediction performance, robustness and
interpretability than the baseline CDMs.},

 abstract = {Educational data mining is widely deployed to extract valuable
information and patterns from academic data. This research explores new
features that can help predict the future performance of undergraduate
students and identify at -risk students early on. It answers some
crucial and intuitive questions that are not addressed by previous
studies. Most of the existing research is conducted on data from 2-3
years in an absolute grading scheme. We examined the effects of
historical academic data of 15 years on predictive modelling.
Additionally, we explore the performance of undergrad uate students in a
relative grading scheme and examine the effects of grades in core
courses and initial semesters on future performances. As a pilot study,
we analyzed the academic performance of Computer Science university
students. Many exciting discoveries were made; the duration and size of
the historical data play a significant role in predicting future
performance, mainly due to changes in curriculum, faculty, society, and
evolving trends. Furthermore, predicting grades in ad vanced courses
based on initial pre -requisite courses is challenging in a relative
grading scheme, as students' performance depends not only on their
efforts but also on their peers. In short, educational data mining can
come to the rescue by uncovering valuable insights from academic data to
predict future performances and identify the critical areas that need
significant improvement.},

 abstract = {As an emerging teaching method, online learning is becoming increasingly
popular among learners. However, one of the major drawbacks of this
learning style is the lack of effective communication and feedback,
which can lead to a higher risk of students failing or dropping out. In
response to this challenge, this paper proposes a student performance
prediction model based on multidimensional time-series data analysis by
considering multidimensional data such as students' learning behaviors,
assessment scores, and demographic information, which is able to extract
the characteristics of students' learning behaviors and capture the
connection between multiple characteristics to better explore the impact
of multiple factors on students' performance. The model proposed in this
paper helps teachers to individualize education for students at
different levels of proficiency and identifies at-risk students as early
as possible to help teachers intervene in a timely manner. In
experiments on the Open University Learning Analytics Dataset (OULAD),
the model achieved 74\% accuracy and 73\% F1 scores in a four-category
prediction task and was able to achieve 99.08\% accuracy and 99.08\% F1
scores in an early risk prediction task. Compared with the benchmark
model, both the multi-classification prediction ability and the early
prediction ability, the model in this paper has a better performance.},

 abstract = {Numerous educational institutions utilize data mining techniques to
manage student records, particularly those related to academic
achievements, which are essential in improving learning experiences and
overall outcomes. Educational data mining (EDM) is a thriving research
field that employs data mining and machine learning methods to extract
valuable insights from educational databases, primarily focused on
predicting students' academic performance. This study proposes a novel
federated learning (FL) standard that ensures the confidentiality of the
dataset and allows for the prediction of student grades, categorized
into four levels: low, good, average, and drop. Optimized features are
incorporated into the training process to enhance model precision. This
study evaluates the optimized dataset using five machine learning (ML)
algorithms, namely support vector machine (SVM), decision tree, Naive
Bayes, K-nearest neighbors, and the proposed federated learning model.
The models' performance is assessed regarding accuracy, precision,
recall, and F1-score, followed by a comprehensive comparative analysis.
The results reveal that FL and SVM outperform the alternative models,
demonstrating superior predictive performance for student grade
classification. This study showcases the potential of federated learning
in effectively utilizing educational data from various institutes while
maintaining data privacy, contributing to educational data mining and
machine learning advancements for student performance prediction.},

 abstract = {In the field of educational data mining, accurately predicting student
performance is vital for developing effective educational strategies.
However, existing methods often fall short in capturing the complex
relationships between students, focusing mainly on individual
attributes. This paper introduces a pioneering framelet-based dual
hypergraph neural network (FD-HGNN) model to advance this task. Our
innovative approach decomposes student feature matrices into low-pass
and high-pass components using a framelet-based transform. These
components form the basis for creating hypergraphs, capturing intricate
student relationships. The model integrates a dual hypergraph neural
network with distinct channels for low-pass and high-pass components,
augmented by a variance interaction layer employing an attention
mechanism. This structure ensures a more comprehensive representation of
student data, enhancing prediction accuracy. Extensive validation
against traditional machine learning methods and graph neural networks
across four real-world educational datasets demonstrates the superiority
of our approach. The findings highlight the significant potential of our
model in revolutionizing student performance prediction in educational
settings.},

 abstract = {Education is crucial for a productive life and providing necessary
resources. With the advent of technology like artificial intelligence,
higher education institutions are incorporating technology into
traditional teaching methods. Predicting academic success has gained
interest in education as a strong academic record improves a
university's ranking and increases student employment opportunities.
Modern learning institutions face challenges in analyzing performance,
providing high-quality education, formulating strategies for evaluating
students' performance, and identifying future needs. E-learning is a
rapidly growing and advanced form of education, where students enroll in
online courses. Platforms like Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS),
learning management systems (LMS), and massive open online courses
(MOOC) use educational data mining (EDM) to develop automatic grading
systems, recommenders, and adaptative systems. However, e-learning is
still considered a challenging learning environment due to the lack of
direct interaction between students and course instructors. Machine
learning (ML) is used in developing adaptive intelligent systems that
can perform complex tasks beyond human abilities. Some areas of
applications of ML algorithms include cluster analysis, pattern
recognition, image processing, natural language processing, and medical
diagnostics. In this research work, K-means, a clustering data mining
technique using Davies' Bouldin method, obtains clusters to find
important features affecting students' performance. The study found that
the SVM algorithm had the best prediction results after parameter
adjustment, with a 96\% accuracy rate. In this paper, the researchers
have examined the functions of the Support Vector Machine, Decision
Tree, naive Bayes, and KNN classifiers. The outcomes of parameter
adjustment greatly increased the accuracy of the four prediction models.
Na \& iuml;ve Bayes model's prediction accuracy is the lowest when
compared to other prediction methods, as it assumes a strong independent
relationship between features.},

 abstract = {Developing tools to support students, educators, intuitions, and
government in the educational environment has become an important task
to improve the quality of education and learning outcomes. Information
and communication technology (ICT) is adopted by educational
institutions; one such instance is video interaction in flipped
teaching. ICT-based learning generates a huge amount of data that can be
utilized to better understand student behavior and improve students
learning. Predicting students' academic performance is essential to take
proactive measures to improve student learning and reduce the risk of
student dropout and failure. This study aims to use video learning
analysis and data mining approaches to predict student academic
achievement and identify the factors affecting their performance. For
this purpose, the dataset containing records of 326 students from a
higher education institution (HEI) is used which contains records from
SIS, Moodle, and eDify. This study advocates the use of a balanced
dataset and optimized feature set to obtain better performance for
students' academic performance prediction. Several machine learning and
deep learning models are applied to analyze their performance against
the original dataset, balanced dataset, and balanced dataset with the
optimized feature set. Experimental results demonstrate decision tree
classifier outperforms with an accuracy of 99.06\% with a balanced
dataset and optimized feature set. Further analysis indicates that the
video interaction feature has a strong impact on the performance of
students.},

 abstract = {With the widespread popularity of intelligent education, artificial
intelligence plays an important role in the field of education.
Currently, there are issues such as low accuracy and low adaptability.
By comparing algorithms such as logistic regression, decision tree,
random forest (RF), support vector machine, and long short-term memory
(LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN), this article adopted a
multi-classification fusion strategy and fully considered the
adaptability of the algorithm to evaluate and grade students in two
scenarios with different grades and teaching quality. By encoding and
normalizing student grades, six evaluation parameters were selected for
the evaluation criteria of teaching quality through principal component
analysis feature selection. Multi-classifier models were used to fuse
the five models in pairs, improving the accuracy of the experimental
evaluation. Finally, the experimental data of the six fused
multi-classification models in the scenarios of student performance
estimation and teaching quality estimation were compared, and the
experimental effects of education evaluation and grading under different
models were analyzed. The experimental results showed that the LSTM
RNN-RF model had the strongest adaptability in the scenario of student
performance estimation, with an estimation accuracy of 98.5\%, which was
12.9\% higher than a single RF model. This experiment was closely
related to educational scenarios and fully considered the adaptability
of different machine learning algorithms to different scenarios,
improving the prediction and classification accuracy of the model.},

 abstract = {In this article, student video visualization profiles are analyzed with
two objectives: 1) to identify difficult sections in videos and 2) to
predict student performance based on their video visualization profiles.
For identifying critical sections in videos two novel indicators are
proposed. The first one is designed to measure the complexity of the
concept being described. The second proposal, identifies video sections
that are more visually complex. For the first indicator, the average
number of forward and backward passes are used. The higher the number of
backward (forward) passes over a region, the more challenging (easy) the
section is. For identifying sections with complex visuals, the number of
pauses is recorded. Finally, the student performance prediction is
carried out with the purpose of detecting the alignment between videos
and their related questions. The results show that video visualization
profiles are a good tool to identify video and question alignment.},

 abstract = {Educational Data Mining (EDM) is used to ameliorate the teaching and
learning process by analyzing and classifying data that can be applied
to predict the students' academic performance, and students' dropout
rate, as well as instructors' performance. The prediction of student
performance is complicated by the vast and diverse range of variables
from academic records to behavioral and health metrics. In this paper,
we have introduced a new Adaptive Feature Selection Algorithm (AFSA) by
amalgamating an ensemble approach for initial feature ranking with
normalized mean ranking from five distinct methods to enhance
robustness. The proposed method iteratively selects the best features by
adjusting its threshold based on each feature's rank to ensure
significant contributions to model accuracy and also effectively reduces
dataset complexity. We have tested the performance of the proposed
feature selection algorithm using five machine learning classifiers:
Logistic Regression (LR), K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Support Vector
Machine (SVM), Na \& iuml;ve Bayes (NB) classifier, and Decision Tree
(DT) classifier on four student performance datasets. The experimental
results highlight the proposed method significantly decreases feature
count by an average feature reduction factor of 5.7, significantly
streamlining datasets while maintaining competitive cross-validation
accuracy, marking it as a valuable tool in the field of educational data
analytics.},

 abstract = {Education is essential and increasingly crucial for the development of
almost all countries worldwide. As educational data has become
increasingly available, scholars have shown a growing interest in
exploring the correlation between students' academic achievements and
other factors that may impact their performance using machine learning
algorithms. This research paper introduces a novel hybrid classifier
that aims to predict the academic performance of students by using a
combination of di ff erent single algorithms. The proposed hybrid
classifier (PHC) is compared to six available classification algorithms
(random forest (RF), C4.5, classification and regression trees (CART),
support vector machines (SVM), naive Bayes (NB) and K -nearest neighbors
(KNN)) using recall, precision, F1 -score, and accuracy evaluation
measures. Our experimental results reveal that the PHC classifier
consistently outperforms the individual classifiers across multiple
evaluation metrics. Specifically, the PHC classifier achieved an
accuracy rate of 92.40\%, surpassing the RF, C4.5, and CART classifiers,
which were the next best performers. In terms of precision and F1 score,
the PHC also demonstrated superior performance, indicating its
robustness in correctly identifying positive instances and providing
balanced accuracy. While the C4.5 classifier performed comparably to the
PHC classifier concerning the recall metric, the hybrid model's overall
performance highlights its e ff ectiveness in leveraging the
complementary strengths of the included classifiers. The suggested
hybrid model has the potential to enhance students' academic performance
and success more e ff ectively and e ffi ciently. It could benefit
students, educators, and academic institutions. Additionally, it
provides practical insights for educators and institutions striving to
improve student achievement using predictive analysis.},

pivotal for educational advancement, relying heavily on advanced machine
learning (ML) methodologies. This predictive approach involves analyzing
comprehensive datasets, emphasizing academic records, demographics, and
various educational metrics, with a particular focus on Mathematics.
Techniques like classification, regression analysis, decision trees, and
neural networks yield highly accurate projections, aiding in timely
interventions crucial for supporting students navigating mathematical
complexities. These algorithms optimize resource allocation within
educational institutions, identifying and aiding students requiring
extra assistance in their mathematical pursuits. This study pioneers the
enhancement of predictive capabilities in Mathematics through the
innovative integration of the K-Nearest Neighbor Classification (KNNC)
model with 2 novel optimization techniques: the Honey Badger Algorithm
(HBA) and the Arithmetic Optimization Algorithm (AOA). By harnessing
these cutting-edge ML and bio-inspired algorithms, the research is
dedicated to pushing the boundaries of precision and reliability in
forecasting, with a specific focus on elevating educational outcomes
within the domain of Mathematics. The outcomes obtained for G1 and G3
reveal that the KNHB model exhibited outstanding performance in
predicting and categorizing G3. It achieved remarkable Accuracy and
Precision of 0.921 and 0.92, respectively. Moreover, the KNHB proved to

 abstract = {Student cognitive modeling plays an important role in the rapid
development of educational data mining research. It aims to discover
students' proficiency in knowledge concepts as well as to predict
students' performance in conducting exercises. Studies in the past few
years have been mainly centered around two types of techniques:
cognitive diagnosis models and data mining approaches. Cognitive
diagnosis models focus on students' cognitive states and assess their
knowledge concept proficiency through handcrafted features. The
subjective features may trigger cascading errors in the students'
performance prediction. On the other hand, data mining techniques, e.g.,
matrix factorization methods, achieve high prediction accuracy by
directly modeling the students' exercising process. It lacks measuring
the students' knowledge concept proficiency. To address the dilemma of
the aforementioned methods, in this paper, we propose a scalable
non-negative matrix co-factorization (SNMCF) model by jointly modeling
the students' knowledge states and their exercising process. SNMCF can
achieve high accuracy in predicting students' exercise performance while
modeling their states of knowledge concepts in a given domain. We
conduct extensive experiments on several real-world datasets, including
large sparse ones, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our new approach
in terms of prediction accuracy, cognitive diagnostic ability, and
scalability.},

 abstract = {educational outcomes across varied institutions like universities,
schools, and training centers necessitates accurately predicting student
performance. These systems aggregates the data from multiple
sources-exam centers, virtual courses, registration departments, and
e-learning platforms. Analyzing this complex and diverse educational
data is a challenge, thus necessitating the application of machine
learning techniques. Utilizing machine learning algorithms for
dimensionality reduction simplifies intricate datasets, enabling more
comprehensive analysis. Through machine learning, educational data is
refined, uncovering valuable patterns and forecasts by simplifying
complexities via feature selection and dimensionality reduction methods.
This refinement significantly amplifies the efficacy of student
performance prediction systems, empowering educators and institutions
with data-driven insights and thereby enriching the overall educational
landscape. In this particular research, the Decision Tree Classification
(DTC) model is used for forecasting student performance. DTC stands out
as a potent machine-learning method for classification purposes. Two
optimization algorithms, namely the Fox Optimization (FO) and the Black
Widow Optimization (BWO), are integrated to heighten the model's
accuracy and efficiency further. The amalgamation of DTC with these
pioneering optimization techniques underscores the study's dedication to
harnessing the forefront of machine learning and bio-inspired
algorithms, ensuring more precise and resilient predictions of student
performance, ultimately culminating in improved educational outcomes.
From the results garnered for G1 and G3, it is evident that the DTBW
model demonstrated the most exceptional performance in both predicting
and categorizing G1, achieving an Accuracy and Precision value of 93.7
percent. Conversely, the DTFO model emerged as the most precise
predictor for G3, achieving an Accuracy and Precision of 93.4 and 93.5
percent, respectively, in the prediction task.},

 abstract = {-Modern universities must strategically analyze and manage student
performance, utilizing knowledge discovery and data mining to extract
valuable insights and enhance efficiency. Educational Data Mining (EDM)
is a theory -oriented approach in academic settings that integrates
computational methods to improve academic performance and faculty
management. Machine learning algorithms are essential for knowledge
discovery, enabling accurate performance prediction and early student
identification, with classification being a widely applied method in
predicting student performance based on various traits. Utilizing the
Naive Bayes classifier (NBC) model, this research predicts student
performance by harnessing the robust capabilities inherent in this
classification tool. To bolster both efficiency and accuracy, the model
integrates two optimization algorithms, namely Jellyfish Search
Optimizer (JSO) and Artificial Rabbits Optimization (ARO). This
underscores the research's commitment to employing cutting -edge machine
learning and algorithms inspired by nature to achieve heightened
precision in predicting student performance through the refinement of
decision -making and prediction quality. To classify and predict G1 and
G3 grades and evaluate students' performance in this study, a
comprehensive analysis of the information pertaining to 395 students has
been conducted. The results indicate that in predicting G1, the NBAR
model, with an F1\_Score of 0.882, performed almost 1.03\% better than
the NBJS model, which had an F1\_Score of 0.873. In G3 prediction, the
NBAR model outperformed the NBJS model with F1\_Score values of 0.893
and 0.884, respectively.},

 abstract = {Student performance prediction was deployed to predict learning
performance to identify at-risk students and provide interventions for
them. However, prediction models should also consider external factors
along with learning activities, such as course duration. Thus, we aim to
distinguish the difference factor between the time dimension (duration
of the course) and the feature dimension (students' learning activities)
by attention weights to provide helpful information and improve
predictions of student performance. In this study, we introduce
Attention-Based Artificial Neural Network (Attn-ANN), a novel model in
educational data mining. The Attn-ANN combines attention weighting on
the time and feature dimensions to examine the significance of lectures
and learning activities and makes predictions by visualizing attention
weight. We found that the Attn-ANN had a better area under the curve
scores than conventional algorithms, and the attention mechanism allowed
models to focus on input selectively. Incorporating the attention
weighting of both the time and feature dimensions improved the
prediction performance in an ablation study. Finally, we investigated
and analyzed the model's decision, finding that the Attn-ANN may be able
to create synergy in real-world scenarios between the Attn-ANN's
predictions and instructors' expertise, which underscores a novel
contribution to engineering applications for interventions for at-risk
students.},

 abstract = {Utilisation of Educational Data Mining (EDM) can be useful in predicting
academic performance of students to mitigate student attrition rate,
allocation of resources, and aid in decision-making processes for higher
education institution. This article uses a large dataset from the
Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) consisting of
612,004 participants from 79 countries, supported by the machine
learning approach to predict student academic performance. Unlike most
of the literature that is confined to one geographical location or with
limited datasets and factors, this article studies other factors that
contribute to academic success and uses student data from various
backgrounds. The accuracy of the proposed model to predict student
performance achieved 74\%. It is discovered that Gradient Boosted Trees
surpass the other classification models that were considered (Logistic
Regression, Na \& iuml;ve Bayes, Deep Learning, Random Forest, Fast
Large Margin, Generalised Linear Model, Decision Tree and Support Vector
Machine). Reading skills and habits are of the highest importance in
predicting the academic performance of students.},

 abstract = {Purpose/ObjectivesAdmission into dental school involves selecting
applicants for successful completion of the course. This study aimed to
predict the academic performance of Kulliyyah of Dentistry,
International Islamic University Malaysia pre-clinical dental students
based on admission results using artificial intelligence machine
learning (ML) models, and Pearson correlation coefficient
(PCC).MethodsML algorithms logistic regression (LR), decision tree (DT),
random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) models were
applied. Academic performance prediction in pre-clinical years was made
using three input parameters: age during admission, pre-university
Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA), and total matriculation semester.
PCC was deployed to identify the correlation between pre-university CGPA
and dental school grades. The proposed models' classification accuracy
ranged from 29\% to 57\%, ranked from highest to lowest as follows: RF,
SVM, DT, and LR. Pre-university CGPA was shown to be predictive of
dental students' academic performance; however, alone they did not yield
optimal outcomes. RF was the most precise algorithm for predicting
grades A, B, and C, followed by LR, DT, and SVM. In forecasting failure,
LR predicted three grades with the highest recall, SVM predicted two
grades, and DT predicted one. RF performance was
insignificant.ConclusionThe findings demonstrated the application of ML
algorithms and PCC to predict dental students' academic performance.
However, it was limited by several factors. Each algorithm has unique
performance qualities, and trade-offs between different performance
metrics may be necessary. No definitive model stood out as the best
algorithm for predicting student academic success in this study.},

 abstract = {Analyzing students' behaviour during online classes is vital for
teachers to identify the strengths and weaknesses of online classes.
This analysis, based on observing academic performance and student
activity data, helps teachers to understand the teaching outcomes. Most
Educational Data Mining (EDM) processes analyze students' academic or
behavioural data; in this case, the accurate prediction of student
behaviours could not be achieved. This study addresses these issues by
considering student's activity and academic performance datasets to
evaluate teaching and learner outcomes efficiently. It is necessary to
utilize a suitable method to handle the high dimensional data while
analyzing Educational Data (ED), because academic data is growing daily
and exponentially. This study uses two kinds of data for student
behaviour analysis. It is essential to use feature reduction and
selection methods to extract only important features to improve the s
tudent's behaviour analysis performance. By utilizing a hybrid ensemble
method to get the most relevant features to predict students'
performance and activity levels, this approach helps to reduce the
complexity of the feature-learning model and improve the prediction
performance of the classification model. This study uses Improved
Principal Component Analysis (IPCA) to select the most relevant feature.
The resultant features of the IPCA are given as input to an ensemble
method to select the most relevant feature sets to improve the
prediction accuracy. The prediction is done with the help of Residual
Network-50 (ResNet50) is combined with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to
classify students' performance and activity during online classes. This
performance analysis evaluates the students' behaviour analysis model.
The proposed approach could predict the performance and activity of
students with a maximum of 98.03\% accuracy for online classes, and
98.06\% accuracy for exams.},

NN), Naive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machines (SVM), and Decision Trees
(DT). Our results show that the SVM model, using the 8 features selected
by RFECV-RF, outperforms the other classifiers with an accuracy of 87\%.
This demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency of our feature
selection method and the superiority of the SVM model in predicting
student performance.},

 abstract = {Learning analytics intervention (LAI) studies aim to identify at-risk
students early during an academic term using predictive models and
facilitate educators to provide effective interventions to improve
educational outcomes. A major impediment to the uptake of LAI is the
lack of access to LAI infrastructure by educators to pilot LAI, which
typically requires substantial institution-wide efforts and investment
to collect related data sets and develop accurate predictive models that
identify at-risk students and also provide tools to facilitate
interventions. This paper presents a novel LAI framework, termed Student
Performance Prediction and Action (SPPA), that facilitates educators to
seamlessly provide LAIs in their courses avoiding the need for
large-scale institution-wide efforts and investments. Educators develop
course-specific predictive models using historical course assessment
data. In learning analytics, providing effective interventions is a
challenge. SPPA utilises pedagogy principles in course design and
interventions to facilitate effective interventions by providing
insights into students' risk levels, gaps in students' knowledge, and
personalised study/revision plans addressing knowledge gaps. SPPA was
evaluated in a large undergraduate course on its ability to predict
at-risk students and facilitate effective interventions as well as its
ease of use by academics. The results are encouraging with high
performance of predictive models, facilitating effective interventions
leading to significant improved educational outcomes with positive
feedback and uptake by academics. With its advantages, SPPA has the
potential to catalyse and influence wide-scale adoption in LAIs.},

 abstract = {Student performance prediction (SPP) is a pivotal task in educational
analytics, enabling proactive interventions and optimized resource
allocation by educators. Traditional SPP models are often hindered by
their complexity and lack of interpretability. This study introduces a
novel SPP framework, the Belief Rule Base with automated construction
(Auto-BRB), designed to address these issues. Firstly, reference values
are derived through data mining techniques. The model employs an IF-THEN
rule-based system integrated with evidential reasoning to ensure both
transparency and interpretability. Secondly, parameter optimization is
achieved using the Projected Covariance Matrix Adaptive Evolution
Strategy (P-CMA-ES), significantly enhancing model accuracy. Moreover,
the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is then applied to fine-tune the
balance between model accuracy and complexity. Finally, case studies on
SPP have shown that the Auto-BRB model has an advantage over traditional
models in terms of accuracy, while maintaining good interpretability.
Therefore, Auto-BRB has excellent application effects in educational
data analysis.},

 abstract = {Technology-enhanced learning supported by virtual learning environments
(VLEs) facilitates tutors and students. VLE platforms contain a wealth
of information that can be used to mine insight regarding students'
learning behaviour and relationships between behaviour and academic
performance, as well as to model data-driven decision-making. This study
introduces a system that we termed ASIST: a novel Attention-aware
convolutional Stacked BiLSTM network for student representation learning
to predict their performance. ASIST exploits student academic registry,
VLE click stream, and midterm continuous assessment information for
their behaviour representation learning. ASIST jointly learns the
student representation using five behaviour vectors. It processes the
four sequential behaviour vectors using a separate stacked bidirectional
long short term memory (LSTM) network. A deep convolutional neural
network models the diurnal weekly interaction behaviour. It also employs
the attention mechanism to assign weight to features based on their
importance. Next, five encoded feature vectors are concatenated with the
assessment information, and, finally, a softmax layer predicts the
high-performer (H), moderate-performer (M), and at-risk (F) categories
of students. We evaluate ASIST over three datasets from an Irish
university, considering five evaluation metrics. ASIST achieves an area
under the curve (AUC) score of 0.86 to 0.90 over the three datasets. It
outperforms three baseline deep learning models and four traditional
classification models. We also found that the attention mechanism has a
slight impact on ASIST's performance. The ablation analysis reveals that
weekly event count has the greatest impact on ASIST, whereas diurnal
weekly interaction has the least impact. The early prediction using the
first seven weeks of data achieves an AUC of 0.83 up to 0.89 over the
three datasets. In yearly analysis, ASIST performs best over the 2018/19
dataset and worst over the 2020/21 dataset.},

 abstract = {PurposePredicting student performance is crucial in educational settings
to identify and support students who may need additional help or
resources. Understanding and predicting student performance is essential
for educators to provide targeted support and guidance to students. By
analyzing various factors like attendance, study habits, grades, and
participation, teachers can gain insights into each student's academic
progress. This information helps them tailor their teaching methods to
meet the individual needs of students, ensuring a more personalized and
effective learning experience. By identifying patterns and trends in
student performance, educators can intervene early to address any
challenges and help students acrhieve their full potential. However, the
complexity of human behavior and learning patterns makes it difficult to
accurately forecast how a student will perform. Additionally, the
availability and quality of data can vary, impacting the accuracy of
predictions. Despite these obstacles, continuous improvement in data
collection methods and the development of more robust predictive models
can help address these challenges and enhance the accuracy and
effectiveness of student performance predictions. However, the
scalability of the existing models to different educational settings and
student populations can be a hurdle. Ensuring that the models are
adaptable and effective across diverse environments is crucial for their
widespread use and impact. To implement a student's performance-based
learning recommendation scheme for predicting the student's capabilities
and suggesting better materials like papers, books, videos, and
hyperlinks according to their needs. It enhances the performance of
higher education.Design/methodology/approachThus, a predictive approach
for student achievement is presented using deep learning. At the
beginning, the data is accumulated from the standard database. Next, the
collected data undergoes a stage where features are carefully selected
using the Modified Red Deer Algorithm (MRDA). After that, the selected
features are given to the Deep Ensemble Networks (DEnsNet), in which
techniques such as Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Deep Conditional Random
Field (DCRF), and Residual Long Short-Term Memory (Res-LSTM) are
utilized for predicting the student performance. In this case, the
parameters within the DEnsNet network are finely tuned by the MRDA
algorithm. Finally, the results from the DEnsNet network are obtained
using a superior method that delivers the final prediction outcome.
Following that, the Adaptive Generative Adversarial Network (AGAN) is
introduced for recommender systems, with these parameters optimally
selected using the MRDA algorithm. Lastly, the method for predicting
student performance is evaluated numerically and compared to traditional
methods to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
approach.FindingsThe accuracy of the developed model is 7.66\%, 9.91\%,
5.3\%, and 3.53\% more than HHO-DEnsNet, ROA-DEnsNet, GTO-DEnsNet, and
AOA-DEnsNet for dataset-1, and 7.18\%, 7.54\%, 5.43\% and 3\% enhanced
than HHO-DEnsNet, ROA-DEnsNet, GTO-DEnsNet, and AOA-DEnsNet for
dataset-2.Originality/valueThe developed model recommends the
appropriate learning materials within a short period to improve
student's learning ability.},

 abstract = {Higher education institutions have consistently strived to provide
students with top-notch education. To achieve better outcomes, machine
learning (ML) algorithms greatly simplify the prediction process. ML can
be utilized by academicians to obtain insight into student data and mine
data for forecasting the performance. In this paper, the authors
proposed an ML-based student prediction model based on the demographic,
social, psychological, and economic factors, collectively. The dataset
utilized for this study was compiled from a designed questionnaire
administered to second-year undergraduate students. The objective of
this study is to uncover factors that could assist in predicting
students' performance. Eight ML classifiers, logistic regression, random
forest, support vector machine, XGBoost, support vector machine with a
linear kernel, na \& iuml;ve Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbor, and decision
tree are used to forecast student performance. Additionally, nine
feature selection techniques, variance threshold, XGBoost, feature
importance, recursive feature elimination, chi-square, ridge, Pearson
correlation, lasso, and random forest, are employed to determine optimal
factors. The authors experimented with each technique by creating two
sets of training and testing data with 80:20 and 70:30 proportions,
respectively. Comparatively, the ensemble DXK (DT + XGB + KNN) model
with cross-validation and 80:20 proportions outperformed other standard
classifiers, achieving a highest accuracy of 97.83\%, an r-square of
96.17\%, a precision of 97.94\%, a recall of 97.83\%, and an f1-score of
97.88\%. These were the highest among all models tested. Additionally,
the authors propose the ACO-DT model, which improves the prediction
performance of the top-performing DT classifier by utilizing the Ant
Colony Optimization technique. The findings demonstrate that the
proposed model with 80:20 proportions achieve an accuracy of 98.15\%, an
f1-score of 98.16\%, a precision of 98.18\%, a recall of 98.15\%, and an
r-square of 84.75\%, surpassing all other models for forecasting student
performance. Using the specified data size, this model creation time is
8.49 s. The authors also recommended the future research directions to
further enhance this study.},

 abstract = {In the burgeoning landscape of African smart cities, education stands as
a cornerstone for sustainable development and unlocking future
potential. Accurate student performance prediction holds immense social
importance, enabling early intervention, improved learning outcomes, and
equitable access to quality education, aligning with sustainable
development goals. Traditional models often falter in Africa due to
imbalanced datasets and irrelevant features. This research leverages
machine learning in Nigerian classrooms to predict underperforming
students. Techniques like synthetic minority oversampling, edited
nearest neighbors, and the Boruta algorithm for feature selection,
alongside genetic algorithms for efficiency, enhance model performance.
The ensemble models achieve AUCs of 90-99.7\%, - 99.7\%, effectively
separating low-performing and high-performing students. Implemented via
Streamlit and Heroku, these models support real-time, data-driven
decisions, enhancing early intervention, personalized learning, and
informing policy and public service design. This ensures equitable
education and a brighter future across Africa. By leveraging ML, this
research empowers universities to support struggling students, optimize
educational costs, and promote inclusive development, fostering
data-driven decision-making and resource allocation optimization.
Ultimately, this research paves the way for a future where data empowers
education within African smart cities, unlocking the full potential of
data-driven solutions and ensuring equitable educational opportunities
across the continent. Policy Significance Statement The research
explores machine learning techniques in Nigerian classrooms, creating
predictive models to identify underperforming students. This aids
universities globally in supporting struggling students, optimizing
educational costs, and fostering inclusive development. Leveraging the
synthetic minority oversampling and edited nearest neighbors (SMOTE-ENN)
- ENN) for imbalanced data, Boruta for feature selection, and genetic
algorithms to enhance efficiency. Beyond technical advancements, the
research translates findings into real world impact via a Streamlit and
Heroku web app. This empowers universities worldwide to customize
models, view real-time results, and make informed, data-driven
decisions. Ultimately, this work empowers stakeholders to utilize data
science for equitable and impactful education in African smart cities,
fostering sustainable development.},

 abstract = {This article introduces a novel method that integrates collaborative
filtering into the naive Bayes model to enhance predicting student
academic performance. The combined approach leverages collaborative user
behavior analysis and probabilistic modeling, showing promising results
in improved prediction precision. Collaborative Filtering explores user
behavior patterns, while Naive Bayes employs Bayes' theorem for
probabilistic data classification. Focused on predicting academic
success, the integration incorporates collaborative patterns from
student data for increased accuracy. The method considers similar
students' performance and behavior for nuanced, personalized
predictions. Starting with diverse data collection, including
collaborative patterns among students, Collaborative Filtering
identifies relationships and patterns among those with similar academic
histories. These insights enrich the naive Bayes algorithm, creating a
holistic approach for more accurate predictions, and contributing to
ongoing machine learning initiatives in education.},

 abstract = {Predictive learning outcomes' models for online students can provide
useful information to instructors to estimate students' final
performance in the early stages of a course. Anticipating student
performance can improve learning efficiency. Existing research models
that analysed student data have focused on handcrafted features, but
these models have limitations in exploring new behavioral patterns that
indicate student performance and how they can be used in online courses.
The clickstream data contains a significant amount of information that
accurately describes students' learning processes, which makes it
difficult to construct using hand-crafted features. To analyze student
behavior effectively, we attempted to capture critical knowledge from
the field of natural language processing (NLP) to the field of student
performance prediction in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs), owing to
how closely they resemble each other. In this article, we propose a
novel framework for automatically producing useful data representation
that enhances prediction outcomes using student learning behavior
clickstream data with a self-supervised learning approach. First, we
developed a self-supervised clickstream pre-training setup to model
learner click generation. Second, we adjusted these latent
representations before applying them to a downstream supervised learning
task. Extensive experimental results on two real-world datasets
demonstrated that the proposed approach is effective. The combined
approach of skip-gram embeddings with Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
achieved the highest accuracy, particularly on the Xutangx dataset, with
an accuracy of approximately 72.70\% and an F1-score of approximately
81.03\%. Furthermore, when applied to the KDDCUP dataset, this
methodology exhibited even higher performance, with an accuracy of
80.91\% and an F1-score of 87.42\%. Our results showed the potential of
NLP techniques to improve dropout prediction in MOOCs by extracting
informative representations from clickstream data, allowing a deeper
understanding of student behavior, and facilitating early intervention
strategies.},

 abstract = {Good recommendation for difficulty exercises can effectively help to point the students/users in the right direction, and potentially empower their learning interests. It is however challenging to select the exercises with reasonable difficulty for students as they have different learning status and the size of exercise bank is quite large. The classic collaborative filtering (CF) based recommendation methods rely heavily on the similarities among students or exercises, leading to recommend exercises with mismatched difficulty. This paper proposes a novel exercise recommendation method, which uses Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to predict the coverage of knowledge concepts, and uses Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT) to predict students’ mastery level of knowledge concepts based on the student’s exercise answer records. The predictive results are utilized to filter the exercises; therefore, a subset of exercise bank is generated. As such, a complete list of recommended exercises can be obtained by solving an optimization problem. Extensive experimental studies show that our proposed approach has advantages over some existing baseline methods, not only in terms of the evaluation of difficulty of recommended exercises, but also the diversity and novelty of the recommendation lists.},

 abstract = {Exam paper generation is an indispensable part of teaching. Existing methods focus on the use of question extraction algorithms with labels for each question provided. Obviously, manual labeling is inefficient and cannot avoid label bias. Furthermore, the quality of the exam papers generated by the existing methods is not guaranteed. To address these problems, we propose a novel approach to generating exam papers based on prediction of exam performance. As such, we update the quality of the initially generated questions one by using dynamic programming, as well as in batches by using genetic algorithms. We performed the prediction task by using Deep Knowledge Tracing. Our approach considered the skill weight, difficulty, and distribution of exam scores. By comparisons, experimental results indicate that our approach performed better than the two baselines. Furthermore, it can generate exam papers with adaptive difficulties closely to the expected levels, and the related student exam scores will be guaranteed to be relatively reasonable distribution. In addition, our approach was evaluated in a real learning scenarios and shows advantages.},

 abstract = {Statistics is one of the most challenging courses for university students. The personal learning environment (PLE) pedagogical design was introduced to assist students' Statistics learning. With the PLE pedagogy, this study examined learners' demographic backgrounds, motivational measures (i.e., help-seeking and academic procrastination due to the use of Information and Communication Technologies, ICT), and ill-structured data (i.e., Facebook posts and comments) to understand what student demographic information, how they feel, and what they do can impact their statistics learning performance. Seventy-eight people joined Facebook groups to form statistics learning communities. Using weakly supervised machine learning (ML), we categorized students' Facebook messages into statistics-relevant and statistics-irrelevant. Results of the learning analytics on multimodal sources of student data showed that help-seeking positively predicted statistics achievement. In contrast, academic procrastination with ICT negatively predicted statistics achievement, controlling for students' demographics information, including age, gender, prior knowledge, and Internet/social media use. Moreover, the ensemble ML classified messages constructed by taking the sum of relevance coding (0 or 1) across three selected ML algorithms was highly aligned with the human coded message in terms of the degree of relevance to statistics. The ensemble ML classified messages were conceptualized as students’ cognitive engagement in statistics learning due to their high consistency with the human-labeled relevance coding and were positively associated with statistics achievement with a large effect size. The study contributed to developing an integrated learner-centered learning analytics framework with the PLE pedagogical design encompassing learner backgrounds and unstructured learner artifacts.},

 abstract = {Knowledge tracing is a modeling method of students’ knowledge mastery. The deep knowledge tracing (DKT) model uses long short-term memory (LSTM) to process the sequence data of students exercises. However, the LSTM-based model pays more attention to the short-term response status of students while ignoring the long-term learning process. Moreover, existing graph-based knowledge tracing models focus on the static relationship between exercises and skills, ignoring the dynamic graphs formed by students exercises in a session. In this work, we propose a novel knowledge tracing model which is based on an exercise session graph, named session graph based knowledge tracing (SGKT). The session graph is used to model the students’ answering process. In addition, a relationship graph is used to model the relationship between exercises and skills. Then we use gated graph neural networks to obtain the students’ knowledge state from the session graph and use graph convolutional networks to obtain the embedding representations of exercises and skills in the relationship graph. Next, through the interaction mechanism, multiple interaction states composed of knowledge states and embedding representations are obtained. The attention mechanism is used to find the focus from these states and make predictions. Experiments are conducted on three publicly available datasets and the results show that our approach has advantages over some existing baseline methods.},

 abstract = {Recently the large-scale influence of Covid-19 promoted the fast development of intelligent tutoring systems (ITS). As a major task of ITS, Knowledge Tracing (KT) aims to capture a student’s dynamic knowledge state based on his historical response sequences and provide personalized learning assistance to him. However, most existing KT methods have encountered the data sparsity problem. In real scenarios, an online tutoring system usually has an extensive collection of questions while each student can only interact with a limited number of questions. As a result, the records of some questions could be extremely sparse, which degrades the performance of traditional KT models. To resolve this issue, we propose a Dual-channel Heterogeneous Graph Network (DHGN) to learn informative representations of questions from students’ records by capturing both the high-order heterogeneous and local relations. As the supervised learning manner applied in previous methods is incapable of exploiting unobserved relations between questions, we innovatively integrate a self-supervised framework into the KT task and employ contrastive learning via the two channels of DHGN, supplementing as an auxiliary task to improve the KT performance. Moreover, we adopt the attention mechanism, which has achieved impressive performance in natural language processing tasks, to effectively capture students’ knowledge state. But the standard attention network is inapplicable to the KT task because the current knowledge state of a student usually shows strong dependency on his recently interactive questions, unlike the situation of language processing tasks, which focus more on the long-term dependency. To avoid the inefficiency of standard attention networks in the KT task, we further devise a novel Hybrid Attentive Network (HAN), which produces both the global attention and the hierarchical local attention to model the long-term and short-term intents, respectively. Then, by the gating network, a student’s long-term and short-term intents are combined for efficient prediction. We conduct extensive experiments on several real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed methods achieve significant performance improvement compared to existing state-of-the-art baselines, which validates the effectiveness of the proposed dual-channel heterogeneous graph framework and hybrid attentive network.},

Centrifuge shaking table tests and moving-steps strategy is used to create database for model training. Results shows that DBO-Bidirectional Long-Short Term Memory (BiLSTM) demonstrate superiority than DBO-RNN, DBO-LSTM and DBO-Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) due to its unique bidirectional learning ability. Moreover, 20 cases involving artificial waves with an average PGA of 0.1 g were predicted using the DBO-BiLSTM model and subsequently compared with measured data for validation. The results indicate that the proposed DBO-BiLSTM model is effective for time-series prediction of seismic responses in slope reinforcement structures. This model provides valuable solutions for the performance design and health monitoring of slope engineering structures, particularly in situations where monitoring data are limited.},

 abstract = {In graph few-shot learning, few-shot node classification (FSNC) at the node-level is a popular downstream task. Previous FSNC methods primarily rely on meta-learning or metric learning techniques, aiming to mine prior knowledge from the base classes. However, these methods still have some limitations that need to be addressed, namely: (1) conducting multiple tasks for parameter initialization leads to expensive time costs. (2) ignoring the rich information present in novel classes leads to model over-fitting. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel graph augmentation method for FSNC on graph data, which includes both parameter initialization and parameter fine-tuning. Specifically, the parameter initialization conducts only one multi-classification task on the base classes, improving generalization ability and reducing time costs. The parameter fine-tuning is designed to include two data augmentation modules (i.e., support augmentation and shot augmentation) on the novel classes to mine the rich information, thus alleviating model over-fitting. As a result, this paper introduces the first graph augmentation method for FSNC. Experimental results showed that our method achieves supreme performance, compared with state-of-the-art FSNC methods.},

Features include network features, such as team member closeness, success percentile, and failure percentile, and non-network features, such as the number of games published prior by the studio. We propose a novel framework using these features to predict the chance of success for new games with an accuracy higher than 92%. Further, we investigate important features for prediction and provide model interpretability for practical implementations. We then build a decision support tool that allows video game producers, and associated stakeholders such as investors, to understand how the predictive model decides, predicts, and performs its recommendations. The findings have implications for those seeking to proactively impact digital product performance through graph network-generated features of team composition, where features are directly observable, as opposed to features that are more challenging to observe, such as personalities.},

 abstract = {Knowledge tracing (KT) aims to evaluate the knowledge state of students based on their coursework interactions in an intelligent tutoring system (ITS). It is the most fundamental and challenging task in the system. Existing KT models have achieved promising results. However, considerable interactions between the student entity and the other two types of entities (i.e., questions and skills) in ITS have not been well utilized, which restricts the performance of these models. To this end, we propose HIN-KT, a novel heterogeneous information network (HIN)-based pre-processing model, to further enhance the performance of existing KT models. An HIN is first built to model student–question–skill interactions. Subsequently, HIN-KT employs the interaction information modeled by HIN to pre-train embeddings for questions and then adopts pre-trained question embeddings to enhance the performance of recent deep KT models. Experimental results over three public KT datasets demonstrate that large gains in knowledge tracing can be achieved when the proposed HIN-KT model is used to pre-train question embeddings for state-of-the-art deep KT models. In particular, the two state-of-the-art deep KT models, deep knowledge tracing (DKT) and convolutional knowledge tracing (CKT) successfully improved their performance by an average of 7.88% with the help of the HIN-KT model, which is significant progress made in the knowledge tracing domain.},

 abstract = {This study evaluates several machine learning models used in predicting student performance. The data utilized in this study was collected from 253 undergraduate students participating in five classes within one of three courses offered by VnCodelab, an interactive learning management system, to provide insights into student performance. Leveraging the data-rich environment of the interactive learning management system proposed earlier, this study focuses on training a predictive model that forecasts student grades based on the comprehensive data collected during the teaching process. The proposed model capitalizes on the data obtained from students' engagement patterns, time spent on exercises, and progress tracking across learning activities. This study compared five different base classifiers— Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naïve Bayes (NB), and k-nearest Neighbor (k-NN), and an ensemble learning method Stacking Classifier —utilizing a dataset comprising 13 features. The research assesses the model's accuracy, reliability, and implications, contributing to the evolution of educational evaluation by introducing predictive assessment as a transformative tool. The results indicate that the Stacking Classifier accurately predicts students' grade ranges, surpassing individual base classification models by effectively combining their predictive capabilities. Integrating data-driven forecasting into the educational ecosystem can transform teaching methodologies and foster an informed, engaged, and empowered learning environment. This approach cultivates a proactive learning community by empowering students with real-time academic progress forecasts.

Traditional laboratory methods for detecting 4mC DNA methylation have limitations, but the rise of artificial intelligence has introduced efficient computational strategies for 4mC site prediction. Despite this progress, challenges persist in terms of model performance and interpretability. To tackle these challenges, we propose DeepSF-4mC, a deep learning model specifically designed for predicting DNA cytosine 4mC methylation sites by leveraging sequence features.

Leveraging transfer learning, we harness existing models to enhance performance through learned representations or fine-tuning. Ensemble learning techniques combine predictions from multiple models, boosting robustness and accuracy.

 abstract = {Emotions play an important role in the learning process. With intelligent technology support, identification and intervention of learners’ cognition have made great achievement, but the care of emotion has been in the absence for a long time. In recent years, the use of affective computing technology to solve affective loss in online education has become a key research topic. To date, a growing number of studies have investigated automated emotion recognition (AER) in online environments. However, AER has been mainly studied from the perspective of computer science focusing on technical characteristics of developing AI technology while its pedagogical value and educational application has been overlooked. Therefore, this systematic literature review aimed to bring together educational and technical aspects of AER. Following PRISMA methodology, a comprehensive search of AER research from 2010 to 2024 in three databases (Web of Science, Science Direct and IEEE Xplore) identified 117 studies that met inclusion criteria. The articles were coded for report characteristics, educational characteristics (tech platform, pedagogy, assessment, content), technical characteristics (emotion model, emotion category, emotion measurement channel, database, algorithm model) and outcome characteristics (technical result, educational application). We found that the primary purpose of these studies was to develop and evaluate systems for AER, rather than implementing these systems in real online learning environments. Furthermore, our findings indicated a lack of integration between computer science and educational science in the realm of AER. Despite the fact that most algorithm models demonstrated high accuracy in AER, the interpretability of the results was significantly constrained by the quality of the databases used, along with the scarcity of studies focusing on the effective and real-time application of AER results. These findings provide essential guidance for shaping future research and development pathways in this field.},

However, they have not been broadly applied to solve the multi-instance multi-label (MIML) problem, a supervised learning paradigm that combines multi-instance (MI) and multi-label (ML) learning. This work presents new neighbor-based approaches for solving MIML problems. On the one hand, MIML data are transformed into ML data and ML nearest neighbor algorithms are used. On the other hand, algorithms that directly address MIML data and use a bag-based distance are proposed. A comprehensive study and an overall comparison have been conducted to study the performance of these methods using different configurations. Experiments included 16 datasets and 8 performance metrics. The results and statistical tests showed that the problem transformation applied and the distance function used impacted the performance and that the approaches that do not transform the problem obtained the best predictive results. Furthermore, most of the proposed algorithms outperformed the MIMLkNN algorithm, the state-of-art algorithm for MIML learning based on nearest-neighbor. Therefore, the relevance and capabilities of neighbor-based approaches to obtain competitive results in MIML learning are shown. Finally, all the algorithms developed in this paper have been included in the MIML library to facilitate the comparison with other future proposals.},

 abstract = {With the popularity of online learning in recent decades, MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses) are increasingly pervasive and widely used in many areas. Visualizing online learning is particularly important because it helps to analyze learner performance, evaluate the effectiveness of online learning platforms, and predict dropout risks. Due to the large-scale, high-dimensional, and heterogeneous characteristics of the data obtained from online learning, it is difficult to find hidden information. In this paper, we review and classify the existing literature for online learning to better understand the role of visualization in online learning. Our taxonomy is based on four categorizations of online learning tasks: behavior analysis, behavior prediction, learning pattern exploration and assisted learning. Based on our review of relevant literature over the past decade, we also identify several remaining research challenges and future research work.},

 abstract = {Environmental factors and truck traffic loads have significant impacts on asphalt pavement performance. This study implements geospatial hot spot, correlation, and decision tree analyses to investigate the impacts of environmental factors and truck traffic loads on asphalt pavement performance. A pavement database with 1725 asphalt pavement sections from the Long-Term Pavement Performance (LTPP) program was built and analyzed using geospatial hot spot analysis to characterize the spatial patterns of environmental factors, truck traffic loads, and asphalt pavement distresses in different climatic regions across the United States and Canada. The statistical correlation analysis was conducted to identify significant correlations among hot spots of environmental factors, truck traffic loads, and asphalt pavement distresses. The decision tree model, which is a supervised machine learning method, was used to assess pavement performance in an area that is associated with higher risks of distress based on contributing environmental and traffic conditions. The hot spot analysis showed that the pavement sections located in the dry no-freeze region had higher percentages of hot spots of truck traffic loads and associated load-induced distresses, such as fatigue cracking, longitudinal wheel path cracking, and rutting. In the dry no-freeze region, higher percentages of pavement sections were also classified as hot spots of transverse cracking. The pavement sections in the wet freeze region are more likely to experience longitudinal non-wheel path cracking and surface roughness. The decision tree models were built to identify the likeliness of hot spots of asphalt pavement distresses using environmental factors and truck traffic loads. These decision tree models provide enhanced decision-making information in pavement design and maintenance.},

 abstract = {As a fundamental research task for intelligent education, knowledge tracing (KT) aims to trace learners’ dynamic knowledge states and predict their future performance based on their historical response data. However, learners’ cognitive processes cannot be studied in isolation from the context; nevertheless, existing knowledge tracing models mainly use knowledge topology as auxiliary information but do not deeply explore the contextual information of exercises. Thus, an in-depth exploration of multi-layer contextual information in learning scenarios is required, focusing on the cognitive differences among different learners. Furthermore, knowledge tracing models exhibit limited interpretability compared with cognition diagnosis methods integrating educational priors. To address these issues, we propose a multi-layer context-aware deep knowledge tracing (MLC-DKT) model. Specifically, we first present the multi-layer contextual representation method involving knowledge concepts and exercises. In the knowledge state tracing module, we incorporate the learners’ knowledge priors into the attention mechanism to capture the evolution of the learners’ knowledge. Then, we develop a calculation method for the similarity effect among the contextual information, which helps estimate the learners’ knowledge states. In the learning performance prediction module, we introduce the guessing and slipping factors from the cognition diagnosis model to optimize the MLC-DKT model, further improving the performance of the KT model. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets, demonstrating that the MLC-DKT model provides improved predictions of learner performance. Moreover, the MLC-DKT model realizes contextual awareness from knowledge concepts and exercises, making the predictions more interpretable.},

With the designed gating-controlled mechanisms, both the interaction records and students’ different backgrounds are combined effectively for tracing the dynamic changes of students’ mastery of knowledge concepts. Results from extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms the state-of-the-art models on the KT task.

 abstract = {Knowledge Tracing (KT) aims to predict future students’ performance via their responses to a sequence of questions, which serves as a fundamental task for intelligent education. Most of the existing efforts directly predict students’ performance depending on their dynamically changing knowledge states. However, the individualization of questions is neglected and difficulty level differ from question to question, which would give some valuable clues to KT. Towards this end, in this paper, we propose a novel Multiple Question Factors for Knowledge Tracing (MQFKT) method, which fully exploits various question factors to generate better prediction. On one hand, calibrated student-concept connection space is established to obtain fine-grained response representations on questions according to the information of responses on questions. On the other hand, individualized difficulty levels with particular concept for different questions are introduced for improving the prediction performance. Extensive experiments on three datasets have shown that the MQFKT approach achieves more precise prediction of student performance and better interpretation of the model.},

 abstract = {Question-response representation (aka. embedding) lies at the core for knowledge tracing, which is pivotal to model students' evolving knowledge states for predicting their future performance. Existing efforts typically learn question-response representations in a supervised manner, thus inevitably neglecting to excavate implicit information existed in student-question-concept connections and suffering from the issue of data sparsity due to rare student-question interactions. Inspired by the recent success of self-supervised learning, in this paper, we propose a Question-Response representation with dual-level Contrastive Learning (QRCL) for improving knowledge tracing, to address the aforementioned problems. Our approach comprehensively considers three types of views for obtaining question-response representations: the native fold views derived from native interaction between students and questions, the augmented fold views generated by contrastive augmentation with Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), and the co-response relation views acquired by means of correlation among questions. By using delicately designed contrastive rules, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are adopted as backbone to encode the information from each view for better generating question-response representation. Extensive experimental results conducted on five datasets clearly show our proposed method has the capability in effectively predicting students' performances.},

The shear nonlinearity of T800 carbon fiber-reinforced epoxy-based plain-woven composites are investigated by carrying out in-plane shear experiments, and the data sets considering temperature effects are established accordingly. Compared with traditional constitutive models, the proposed ML-based model excels in predicting shear nonlinearity, even at temperatures not included in the training set. The integration of this ML-based constitutive model into the finite element (FE) simulation framework achieves high consistency between simulation and experimental results, thereby validating the significant application of ML in complex material behavior modeling and FE analysis.},
