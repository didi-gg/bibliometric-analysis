abstract="Analytics in educational environments has received much attention during the last few years. Maintaining a high retention rate is still a major concern in higher educational institutions. Therefore, this research aims to early detect students at risk using three machine learning predictive models, namely support vector machine (SVM), neural networks (NN), and K nearest-neighbors (KNN), based on a new dataset collected from 800 students through surveys. The criteria used to evaluate the models were accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Regarding the accuracy, the SVM model has outperformed the NN and KNN models, where it achieves 86.7{\%}. Concerning the sensitivity, the NN model was more sensitive to detect failure cases than the other two models. Regarding the specificity, it was very high for the three models. It is believed that the results could assist the educators in early detecting students at risk, and therefore, reducing students' dropouts.",

 abstract = {Interventions based on learning analytics have a very important place in closing the learning analytics loop. However, data-driven studies that test the effects of learning analytics-based interventions on students' online learning behaviors are very limited. In this study, the effect of the student-facing learning analytics dashboard (LAD) on the learning behavior of students in the online learning environment was investigated by using the differential pattern mining method. In a completely remote course, the learning behaviors of the participants before the introduction of the dashboard were compared with the learning behaviors they exhibited after the dashboard was introduced. In this way, it has become possible to analyze the behavior changes after the dashboard intervention. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to test whether these behavioral changes were statistically significant or not. According to the Wilcoxon signed-rank test results, while there is no significant difference in terms of students’ assignment and quiz interactions, it is seen that there is a statistically significant increase in terms of students’ forum-related activities such as reading other students’ posts, starting a new discussion, and replying others’ posts. Students’ SCORM interactions (e.g, launch, complete) were also increased after engaging with the LAD. In addition, it was found that the overall interaction of students in the online learning environment increased by 57% when the LAD was used.},

 abstract = {Academic failure is a persistent challenge in education. Despite the limited available data, in this study, we focus on identifying at-risk students in a blended learning (BL) course. Several motivational variables are analyzed to determine their effect on student performance. We use a machine-learning classifier to compare two approaches: 1) The benchmark study, which uses data from the same academic year for both training and testing; and 2) a prospective study, which focuses on extrapolating a model trained on the previous fall semester to predict outcomes for the upcoming fall semester. We categorize the motivational variables, including time management and event-occurrence frequency. The window-expansion strategy is adopted to enhance performance through periodic evaluation to facilitate timely intervention. Consequently, the prospective approach is consistent with the benchmark results, thus demonstrating its generalizability across academic years and student populations. This approach is promising for identifying at-risk students in the BL course early. The Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) method emphasizes the importance of time-management variables, particularly study in time, for identifying at-risk students. This study enhances our understanding of early detection methods for at-risk students. By analyzing time-related behaviors, we establish a robust foundation for data-driven decisions to improve future BL implementations as well as support motivation and self-regulated learning practices.},

 abstract = {Learning analytics has matured significantly since its early days. The field has rapidly grown in terms of the reputation of its publication venues, established a vibrant community, and has demonstrated an increasing impact on policy and practice. However, the boundaries of the field are still being explored by many researchers in a bid to determine what differentiates a contribution in learning analytics from contributions in related fields, which also center around data in education. In this paper, we propose that instead of emphasizing the examination of differences, a healthy development of the field should focus on collaboration and be informed by the developments in related fields. Specifically, the paper presents a framework for analysis how contemporary fields focused on the study of data in education influence trends in learning analytics. The framework is focused on the methodological paradigms that each of the fields is primarily based on – i.e., essentialist, entatitive/reductionst, ontological/dialectical, and existentialist. The paper uses the proposed framework to analyze how learning analytics (ontological) is being methodologically influenced by recent trends in the fields of educational data mining (entatitive), quantitative ethnography (existentialist), and learning at scale (essentialist). Based on the results of the analysis, this paper identifies gaps in the literature that warrant future research.},

 abstract = {Advances in machine learning methods and the availability of new data sources show promise for improving prediction of operational risk. Maritime transportation is the backbone of global supply chains and maritime accidents can lead to costly disruptions. We describe a case study performed for the United States Coast Guard (USCG) to develop a prototype risk prediction system to provide early alerts of elevated risk levels to vessel traffic managers and operators in the Lower Mississippi River, the second largest port of entry in the United States. Integrating incident and accident data from the USCG with environmental and traffic data sources, we tested existing machine learning algorithms in their predictive ability. We found poor accident prediction accuracy in cross‐validation using the traditional measures of precision and sensitivity. In this specific operational context, however, such single‐class accuracy metrics can be misleading. We define action precision and action sensitivity metrics that measure the accuracy of predictions in engendering the correct behavioral response (actions) among vessel operators, rather than getting the specific event classification correct. We use these operationally appropriate measures for maritime risk prediction to choose an algorithm for our prototype system. While the traditional metrics indicated that none of the algorithms would perform sufficiently well to use in the early warning system, the modified metrics show that the top performing algorithm will perform well in this operational context.},

 abstract = {Recently, learning analytics (LA) has drawn the attention of academics, researchers, and administrators. This interest is motivated by the need to better understand teaching, learning, “intelligent content,” and personalization and adaptation. While still in the early stages of research and implementation, several organizations (Society for Learning Analytics Research and the International Educational Data Mining Society) have formed to foster a research community around the role of data analytics in education. This article considers the research fields that have contributed technologies and methodologies to the development of learning analytics, analytics models, the importance of increasing analytics capabilities in organizations, and models for deploying analytics in educational settings. The challenges facing LA as a field are also reviewed, particularly regarding the need to increase the scope of data capture so that the complexity of the learning process can be more accurately reflected in analysis. Privacy and data ownership will become increasingly important for all participants in analytics projects. The current legal system is immature in relation to privacy and ethics concerns in analytics. The article concludes by arguing that LA has sufficiently developed, through conferences, journals, summer institutes, and research labs, to be considered an emerging research field.},

 abstract = {In information security context, social engineering is defined as malicious activities caused by cybercriminals by means of human interactions. It is mainly a psychological manipulation technique which gets benefit of human error to reach private information. This study used machine learning algorithms to predict individuals’ susceptibility to be tricked by social engineering attacks. Simulated scenarios were presented to study participants, and they were asked to identify whether each scenario was a social engineering attack or not. Different kinds of attacks related to various industries were integrated to social engineering simulations. For each participant, different types of social engineering scores were calculated according to their responses. Besides simulations, questionnaires related to demographics, technology usage, and personality traits were filled out by the participants. All of these collected data were used in building predictive classification and regression machine learning models. Through regression and classification models, it was aimed to proactively predict individuals’ social engineering risk levels and classify them into different risk groups in terms of different attack types. This research revealed that it is possible to predetermine the social engineering risk levels of individuals. This important finding means that possible attacks can be prevented by raising awareness before the attack occurs. Within the scope of this study, a social engineering risk detection mobile application has also been developed to give practitioners and policy makers an idea of what kind of systems can be developed in order to determine the risk levels of individuals and then to educate them about various attacks. The ones who need to take action against social engineering attacks will get benefit from findings of this research.},

 abstract = {Massive open online courses (MOOCs) show great potential to transform traditional education through the Internet. However, the high attrition rates in MOOCs have often been cited as a scale-efficacy tradeoff. Traditional educational approaches are usually unable to identify such large-scale number of at-risk students in danger of dropping out in time to support effective intervention design. While building dropout prediction models using learning analytics are promising in informing intervention design for these at-risk students, results of the current prediction model construction methods do not enable personalized intervention for these students. In this study, we take an initial step to optimize the dropout prediction model performance toward intervention personalization for at-risk students in MOOCs. Specifically, based on a temporal prediction mechanism, this study proposes to use the deep learning algorithm to construct the dropout prediction model and further produce the predicted individual student dropout probability. By taking advantage of the power of deep learning, this approach not only constructs more accurate dropout prediction models compared with baseline algorithms but also comes up with an approach to personalize and prioritize intervention for at-risk students in MOOCs through using individual drop out probabilities. The findings from this study and implications are then discussed.},

Specifically, this approach converts the predicted output from the former weeks into meaningful probabilities to infer the predictions in the current week for maintaining the consecutiveness among learning activities. To demonstrate the efficacy of our model in identifying at-risk students, we compare the weekly AUCs and averaged performance (i.e., accuracy, precision, recall, and f1-score) over each course with the baseline models (i.e., Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, and Decision Tree), respectively. Furthermore, we adopt a Top-K metric to examine the number of at-risk students that the model is able to identify with high precision during each week. Finally, the model output is interpreted through a model-agnostic interpretation approach to support instructors to make informed recommendations for students’ learning. The experimental results demonstrate the capability and interpretability of our model in identifying at-risk students in online learning settings. In addition to that our work also provides significant implications in building accountable machine learning pipelines that can be used to automatically generated individualized learning interventions while considering fairness between different learning groups.},

 abstract = {Predicting student performance in an academic institution is important for detecting at-risk students and administering early-intervention strategies. We propose a new grade prediction model that considers three factors: temporal dynamics of prior courses across previous semesters, short-term performance consistency, and relative performance against peers. The proposed architecture comprises modules that incorporate the attention mechanism, a new short-term gated long short-term memory network, and a graph convolutional network to address limitations of existing works that fail to consider the above factors jointly. A weighted fusion layer is used to fuse learned representations of the above three modules--course importance, performance consistency, and relative performance. The aggregated representations are then used for grade prediction which, in turn, is used to classify at-risk students. Experiment results using three datasets obtained from over twenty thousand students across seventeen undergraduate courses show that the proposed model achieves low prediction errors and high F1 scores compared to existing models that predict grades and thereafter identifies at-risk students via a pre-defined threshold.

 abstract = {Universities are now compelled to attend to metrics that (re)shape our conceptualisation of the student experience. New technologies such as learning analytics (LA) promise the ability to target personalised support to profiled 'at risk' students through mapping large-scale historic student engagement data such as attendance, library use, and virtual learning environment activity as well as demographic information and typical student outcomes. Yet serious ethical and implementation issues remain. Data-driven labelling of students as 'high risk', 'hard to reach' or 'vulnerable' creates conflict between promoting personal growth and human flourishing and treating people merely as data points. This article argues that universities must resist the assumption that numbers and algorithms alone can solve the 'problem' of student retention and performance; rather, LA work must be underpinned by a reconnection with the agreed values relating to the purpose of higher education, including democratic engagement, recognition of diverse and individual experience, and processes of becoming. Such a reconnection, this article contends, is possible when LA work is designed and implemented in genuine collaboration and partnership with students.},

 abstract = {Our modern era has brought about radical changes in the way courses are delivered and various teaching methods are being introduced to answer the purpose of meeting the modern learning challenges. On that account, the conventional way of teaching is giving place to a teaching method which combines conventional instructional strategies with contemporary learning trends. Thereby, a new course type has emerged, the blended course in the context of which online teaching and conventional instruction are efficiently mixed. This paper demonstrates a way to identify factors affecting students' critical performance in blended courses through a binary logistics regression analysis on students' engagement data. The binary logistics regression analysis has led to a risk model which identifies and prioritizes these factors in proportion to their contribution to the risk occurrence. The risk model is demonstrated in the context of two specific blended courses sharing the same learning design. Additionally, the outcome of the study has proved that factors related to the e-learning part have critically affected the students' performance in the respective blended courses.},

 abstract = {Previous studies have proposed many indicators to assess the effect of student engagement in learning and academic achievement but have not yet been clearly articulated. In addition, while student engagement tracking systems have been designed, they rely on the log data but not on performance data. This paper presents results of a non-machine learning model developed using ongoing formative assessment scores as indicators of student engagement. Visualisation of the classification tree results is employed as student engagement indicators for instructors to observe and intervene with students. The results of this study showed that ongoing assessment is related to student engagement and subsequent final programming exam performance and possible to identify students at-risk of failing the final exam. Finally, our study identified students impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. These were students who attended the final programming exam in the semester 2019-2020 and who scored well in formative assessments. Based on these results we present a simple student engagement indicator and its potential application as a student progress monitor for early identification of students at risk.},

 abstract = {Blended learning pedagogical practices supported by learning management systems have become an important part of higher education curricula. In most cases, these blended curricula are evaluated through multimodal formative assessments. Although assessments can strongly affect student outcomes, research on the topic is limited. In this paper, we adopted a learning analytics approach to explore student engagement with formative assessments and the power of these assessments to predict student outcomes in an English for Academic Purposes courses in a Hong Kong university. The study retrieved the data logs from 7,815 students and used the data to analyze student engagement with the formative assessments. The results suggested that the students put effort into completing the assessments. The degree to which assessments predict learning outcomes depend on students' level of subject knowledge and their understanding of the relevance of the assessments. This study showed that learning analytics provided reliable evidence for understanding students' engagement and identifying at-risk students. Therefore, learning analytics research has the potential to inform pedagogical practice.},

 abstract = {As a cutting-edge field of artificial intelligence in education (AIEd) that depends on advanced computing technologies, AI performance prediction model is widely used to identify at-risk students that tend to fail, establish student-centered learning pathways, and optimize instructional design and development. A majority of the existing AI prediction models focus on the development and optimization of the accuracy of AI algorithms rather than applying AI models to provide student with in-time and continuous feedback and improve the students' learning quality. To fill this gap, this research integrated an AI performance prediction model with learning analytics approaches with a goal to improve student learning effects in a collaborative learning context. Quasi-experimental research was conducted in an online engineering course to examine the differences of students' collaborative learning effect with and without the support of the integrated approach. Results showed that the integrated approach increased student engagement, improved collaborative learning performances, and strengthen student satisfactions about learning. This research made contributions to proposing an integrated approach of AI models and learning analytics (LA) feedback and providing paradigmatic implications for future development of AI-driven learning analytics.},

 abstract = {Apart from good instructional design and delivery, effective intervention is another key to strengthen student academic performance. However, intervention has been recognized as a great challenge. Most instructors struggle to identify at-risk students, determine a proper intervention approach, trace and evaluate whether the intervention works. This process requires extensive effort and commitment, which is impractical especially for large classes with few instructors. This paper proposes a platform, namely "i-Ntervene," that integrates Learning Management System (LMS) automatic code grader, and learning analytics features which can empower systematic learning intervention for large programming classes. The platform supports instructor-pace courses on both Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) and traditional classroom setting. The platform iteratively assesses student engagement levels through learning activity gaps. It also analyzes subject understanding from programming question practices to identify at-risk students and suggests aspects of intervention based on their lagging in these areas. Students' post-intervention data are traced and evaluated quantitatively to determine effective intervention approaches. This evaluation method aligns with the evidence-based research design. The developed i-Ntervene prototype was tested on a Java programming course with 253 first-year university students during the COVID-19 pandemic in VLE. The result was satisfactory, as the instructors were able to perform and evaluate 12 interventions throughout a semester. For this experimental course, the platform revealed that the approach of sending extrinsic motivation emails had more impact in promoting learning behavior compared to other types of messages. It also showed that providing tutorial sessions was not an effective approach to improving students' subject understanding in complex algorithmic topics. i-Ntervene allows instructors to flexibly trial potential interventions to discover the optimal approach for their course settings which should boost student's learning outcomes in long term.},

 abstract = {Learning analytics (LA) is considered a promising field of study as it's helping to improve learning and the context in which it occurs. A learner's performance can be defined as how well students are learning in terms of knowledge and skills development and can be analyzed based on students' outcomes and engagement in the course. We have consolidated the work carried out from 2011 to 2022 to improve learners' performance using LA, describe criteria that define learners' performance, discuss parameters that impact learners' performance, and how predictive models can be created to forecast learners' performance using these parameters. Results showed that the data collected from log files of the Learning Management System (LMS) had been used to get insights into the learner's performance in online platforms and LA could bring incredible benefits in the field of the education sector, such as improvement of learners' involvement with learning activities as well as learning outcomes, identification of students at risk, providing real-time feedback, and personalization of learning. Hence, we can say usage of LA significantly helps learners' performance improvement in learning portals. But we can get better results if we augment data from log files of LMS with the learner's personal data from his birth to the current moment, which is a bit challenging with respect to data collection i.e., huge and from multiple sources.},

 abstract = {This study presents the development of a novel automated system, Rapid Analysis and Detection of At-risk students with Artificial intelligence-based Response (RADAR), that utilizes explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) to identify students who are at risk of falling behind or dropping out of school. The system integrates various features, including learners' personality, previous academic performance, current academic concepts progress, and soft skills. Machine learning algorithms are utilized to analyze the combination of data and identify patterns that predict a student's likelihood of falling behind. The proposed RADAR system employs a multi-modal approach, considering the learner's features. The system is trained on a dataset of students from a school district, where the data is collected and preprocessed accordingly. The feature selection algorithm is applied to identify the most relevant features that can accurately predict students at-risk of falling behind or dropping out. The pilot study establishes the framework of the system and examines the implementation implications. The results of this study indicate that the RADAR system achieves high accuracy in identifying at-risk students. Furthermore, the system effectively employs the identified features to predict students' performance in a continuous manner, enabling advisors, administrators, and students to take proactive measures to maintain high academic progress levels. The system is designed to provide an automated and continuous monitoring of the students' performance, and to notify the relevant parties in case of any deviations. The proposed system represents an innovative approach to using XAI for the detection and support of at-risk students, enabling educators to take timely actions. The results of this study demonstrate the potential of the RADAR system to improve the support and guidance provided to at-risk students, and to ultimately improve their academic outcomes.},

In response, educational institutions have rapidly expanded their virtual course offerings and assessment methods. One significant challenge in the realm of online education is the effective assessment of student involvement, engagement, and attentiveness during virtual classes. To address this challenge, we introduce a specialized system tailored to identifying and comprehending the complex range of student behaviors exhibited during online classes. Our system takes into account the diverse contexts and individual considerations that shape students' responses to the online learning environment. It employs user authentication through facial recognition technology and seamlessly integrates vital components, including facial detection, hand tracking, mobile phone detection, and pose estimation modules. Leveraging these components, we extract high-level features to construct a comprehensive dataset for training machine-learning models designed to detect students' attention levels during online classes. After evaluating six prominent machine learning algorithms, we have selected the extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) algorithm, which demonstrated an impressive 99.75% accuracy on the test data. Finally, the system generates a comprehensive anonymous report on the level of attentiveness of students, accessible through a dedicated webpage that includes a summary of the behavior of students throughout online classes, providing valuable insights for personalized interventions and enhanced online learning experiences.},

 abstract = {An early warning system can help to identify at-risk students, or predict student learning performance by analyzing learning portfolios recorded in a learning management system (LMS). Although previous studies have shown the applicability of determining learner behaviors from an LMS, most investigated datasets are not assembled from online learning courses or from whole learning activities undertaken on courses that can be analyzed to evaluate students’ academic achievement. Previous studies generally focus on the construction of predictors for learner performance evaluation after a course has ended, and neglect the practical value of an “early warning” system to predict at-risk students while a course is in progress. We collected the complete learning activities of an online undergraduate course and applied data-mining techniques to develop an early warning system. Our results showed that, time-dependent variables extracted from LMS are critical factors for online learning. After students have used an LMS for a period of time, our early warning system effectively characterizes their current learning performance. Data-mining techniques are useful in the construction of early warning systems; based on our experimental results, classification and regression tree (CART), supplemented by AdaBoost is the best classifier for the evaluation of learning performance investigated by this study.},

 abstract = {Digital textbook analytics are a new method of collecting student-generated data in order to build predictive models of student success. Previous research using self-report or laboratory measures of reading show that engagement with the textbook was related to student learning outcomes. We hypothesized that an engagement index based on digital textbook usage data would predict student course grades. Linear regression analyses were conducted using data from 233 students to determine whether digital textbook usage metrics predicted final course grades. A calculated linear index of textbook usage metrics was significantly predictive of final course grades and was a stronger predictor of course outcomes than previous academic achievement. However, time spent reading, one of the variables that make up the index was more strongly predictive of course outcomes. Additionally, students who were in the top 10th percentile in number of highlights had significantly higher course grades than those in the lower 90th percentile. These findings suggest that digital textbook analytics are an effective early warning system to identify students at risk of academic failure. These data can be collected unobtrusively and automatically and provide stronger prediction of outcomes than prior academic achievement (which to this point has been the single strongest predictor of student success).},

Recent research on these programs has focused primarily on how students’ incoming demographics and prior academic performance predict academic performance at the university level. This study investigated changes in students’ academic motivation orientations over the course of one bridge program, and how a learning analytics-based intervention was employed by academic advisors to inform their face-to-face meetings with students. The results of our study show that students’ mastery orientation decreased over the course of the bridge program, and indicate that students’ exposure to displays of their academic performance negatively predicts this change. The findings suggest that student perceptions of their goals and formative performance need to be carefully considered in the design of learning analytics interventions since the resulting tools can affect students’ interpretations of their own data as well as their subsequent academic success.},

 abstract = {Data analysis to guide the design and deployment of learning experiences has been in use in educational institutions for decades. While this has made it possible to predict retention, flags students at risk and more clearly assesses performance across a range of indicators, few benefits visible to students have resulted. Recent attempts to design learner-facing analytics seem to also have met with indifferent results as they appear to have neglected to focus on student personality and motivation or to train students appropriately to decipher LA-based feedback. The aim of this study is to investigate why current Learning Analytics (LA) systems have so little impact on student motivation. A further goal has been to scrutinize the latest research for potential grounding in theoretical concepts generally – but with emphasis on motivation. Results show that, with few exceptions, neither instructor- nor learner-facing LA currently in use at universities take into consideration student personalities as neither are grounded in appropriate theory. This study contributes to the field of LA and Motivation by providing a clear (if bleak) picture of the lack of focus on student personality and motivation in terms of LA feedback. It is, therefore, timely that to remind the research community that an understanding of the learner’s personality, attributes, and sources of motivation is central to the effectiveness of any feedback design. We see this paper as a starting point for a much-needed deeper discussion.},

 abstract = {Educational institutions need to formulate a well-established data-driven plan to get long-term value from their learning analytics (LA) strategy. By tracking learners’ digital traces and measuring learners’ performance, institutions can discern consequential learning trends via use of predictive models to enhance their instructional services. However, questions remain on how the proposed LA system is suitable, meaningful, and justifiable. In this concept paper, we examine generalizability and transparency of the internals of predictive models, alongside the ethical challenges in using learners’ data for building predictive capabilities. Model generalizability or transferability is hindered by inadequate feature representation, small and imbalanced datasets, concept drift, and contextually un-related domains. Additional challenges relate to trustworthiness and social acceptance of these models since algorithmic-driven models are difficult to interpret by themselves. Further, ethical dilemmas are faced in engaging with learners’ data while developing and deploying LA systems at an institutional level. We propose methodologies for apprehending these challenges by establishing efforts for managing transferability and transparency, and further assessing the ethical standing on justifiable use of the LA strategy. This study showcases underlying relationships that exist between constructs pertaining to learners’ data and the predictive model. We suggest the use of appropriate evaluation techniques and setting up research ethics protocols, since without proper controls in place, the model outcome would not be portable, transferable, trustworthy, or admissible as a responsible outcome.

 abstract = {Student dropout is a serious problem globally. It affects not only the individual who drops out but also the former school, family, and society in general. With the current development of science and technology, big data is emphasized as the most significant technology in data analysis. From the recorded educational data, efficient prediction of students' dropout is currently a hot topic of research. Previous studies have focused only on the students' dropout based on specific levels such as individual, middle school, and university level. However, ensemble learning approaches have not received much research attention so far to predict students' dropout in university classes based on rare datasets. In this paper, we propose a novel stacking ensemble based on a hybrid of Random Forest (RF), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Gradient Boosting (GB), and Feed-forward Neural Networks (FNN) to predict student's dropout in university classes. On the dataset collected from 2016 to 2020 at Constantine the Philosopher University in Nitra, the proposed method has demonstrated greater performance when compared with the base models using testing accuracy and the area under the curve (AUC) evaluation metrics under the same conditions. Based on the findings of this study, students at the risk of dropping out the school can be identified based on influential factors and different agents of education can refer to this information for early intervention in the uncontrolled behavior that can lead to the risk of dropping out and take proactive precautionary measures before the issue arise.},

 abstract = {In higher education, providing personalized feedback and support to students is a significant challenge. Early warning systems can help by identifying both at-risk and high-performing students, allowing for timely interventions and enhanced learning opportunities. In our study, we used a year's worth of data from an information management school to build predictive models for two binary classification problems: identifying at-risk students and high-performing students. We employed traditional machine learning classifiers and long-short term memory units (LSTM), testing them at various stages of course completion. The best performance was achieved using all course data, with an AUC of 0.756 for at-risk students and 78.2% accuracy for high-performing students using Random Forest and Extremely Randomized Trees, respectively. We found that early prediction was possible as early as 25% course completion. Although LSTM showed inferior performance, it offered practical advantages for early prediction. Our findings suggest that static LMS logs can be reliable indicators of student success early in a course, and a course-agnostic time-dependent representation of the number of clicks can offer a worthwhile tradeoff between predictive performance and simplicity in implementation in some instances. These findings have important implications as they suggest the potential for automated early warning systems that can help educators identify students of interest and allocate resources where they are most needed. However, implementing these systems in real-time requires clear protocols and responsible policies. Further research should explore the generalizability of findings across different contexts and continuously evaluate their real-world effectiveness.},

 abstract = {The expanding usage of online learning at all levels of education has drawn attention to the quality of online learning. In this study, online learning quality is evaluated through students’ cognitive engagement which is reflected in their online written messages in discussions and their online participation. This study proposes the use of two types of data: students’ participation, and written messages. Both types of data was collected and analyzed using the data mining technique to produce a predictive model that illustrates students’ pathways while engaging in online learning cognitively. The findings of this study indicate that from 22 variables, only two were significant for students’ online cognitive engagement; sharing information and posting high- level messages. The two variables led to the formation of three different pathways in the students’ predictive model.},

 abstract = {Learning analytics can improve learning practice by transforming the ways we support learning processes. This study is based on the analysis of 252 papers on learning analytics in higher education published between 2012 and 2018. The main research question is: What is the current scientific knowledge about the application of learning analytics in higher education? The focus is on research approaches, methods and the evidence for learning analytics. The evidence was examined in relation to four earlier validated propositions: whether learning analytics i) improve learning outcomes, ii) support learning and teaching, iii) are deployed widely, and iv) are used ethically. The results demonstrate that overall there is little evidence that shows improvements in students' learning outcomes (9%) as well as learning support and teaching (35%). Similarly, little evidence was found for the third (6%) and the forth (18%) proposition. Despite the fact that the identified potential for improving learner practice is high, we cannot currently see much transfer of the suggested potential into higher educational practice over the years. However, the analysis of the existing evidence for learning analytics indicates that there is a shift towards a deeper understanding of students’ learning experiences for the last years.},

 abstract = {To address the demands of modern education and increase flexibility, many higher education institutions are considering self-paced education programs. However, student retention is yet a widely recognized challenge faced in self-paced education. While many studies have examined the potential of the use of data about student interaction with learning technologies to predict student success, studies that focus on self-paced education are scarce. To address this gap in the literature, this paper reports on the findings of a study that has investigated the performance of a well-known deep learning technique i.e., Long Short-term Memory (LSTM), in the prediction of students at risk of failing a course offered in a self-paced mode of online education. The study has utilized a freely accessible Open University Learning Analytics Dataset comprising 22,437 students with 69 % pass, and 31 % failed instances. The deep LSTM shows the highest predictive power to classify between pass and fail students, compared to all other alternatives by achieving an accuracy of 84.57 %, precision of 82.24 % and recall of 79.43 %. Interestingly, with only first five weeks of course activity log data used for training, the receiver operating characteristic based diagnostic accuracy of the LSTM algorithm is achieved up to 71 %, that outperforms almost all other conventional algorithms - despite trained on the complete dataset collected for the entire duration of the course i.e. up to 38 weeks. Furthermore, this study has also employed a shapely additive explanation model to identify the most important predictors of student retention, e.g., assessment submission and attempted quizzes. This approach is essential in order to increase the interpretability of deep learning techniques and, thus, increase their potential to generate actionable insights.},

 abstract = {Flipped classrooms supported by learning management systems (LMS) have been widely adopted by educational institutions. However, earlier studies have found problems with interpreting LMS log data to understand student approaches to learning within the context of a learning design. This study investigates whether it is possible to use LMS log data as a proxy to understand students' learning strategies over different periods of time in the flipped-classroom context. A total of 135 sophomores from two classes of a flipped programming course participated in this study. Exploratory factor analysis is first conducted on the log data to synthesize second-order predictors based on the total-effort model. Then, we investigate the extent to which these second-order predictors relate to students' learning outcomes over time. Four types of learning outcomes are considered, including a quiz, a midterm exam, a final exam and the final grade. For each type of learning outcome, multiple linear regression is used to construct a weekly prediction model from these predictors. Adjusted R-squared and RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) are the metrics used to compare the models. The results show that consistent second-order predictors can be derived from log data, implying that students' clicking events in LMS could manifest students' learning strategies understandable in the design context of a flipped classroom. Furthermore, compared with the first-order models, most of the models constructed using the second-order predictors have higher predictive performance, although with lower data fitness. In addition, the predictive performance of the models with MSLQ (Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire) indicators and past assessment data are also examined. It is found that MSQL variables have a positive but short-termed effect on the models’ predictive ability, while past assessment data greatly improve the models of all types of learning outcomes. Theoretical contributions and implications of the proposed approach for practice, research and future research are discussed.},

 abstract = {Universities are now compelled to attend to metrics that (re)shape our
conceptualisation of the student experience. New technologies such as
learning analytics (LA) promise the ability to target personalised
support to profiled `at risk' students through mapping large-scale
historic student engagement data such as attendance, library use, and
virtual learning environment activity as well as demographic information
and typical student outcomes. Yet serious ethical and implementation
issues remain. Data-driven labelling of students as `high risk', `hard
to reach' or `vulnerable' creates conflict between promoting personal
growth and human flourishing and treating people merely as data points.
This article argues that universities must resist the assumption that
numbers and algorithms alone can solve the `problem' of student
retention and performance; rather, LA work must be underpinned by a
reconnection with the agreed values relating to the purpose of higher
education, including democratic engagement, recognition of diverse and
individual experience, and processes of becoming. Such a reconnection,
this article contends, is possible when LA work is designed and
implemented in genuine collaboration and partnership with students.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia risk is associated with both genetic and
environmental risk factors. Furthermore, cognitive abnormalities are
established core characteristics of schizophrenia. We aim to assess
whether a classification approach encompassing risk factors, cognition,
and their associations can discriminate patients with schizophrenia
(SCZs) from healthy control subjects (HCs). We hypothesized that
cognition would demonstrate greater HC-SCZ classification accuracy and
that combined gene-environment stratification would improve the
discrimination performance of cognition.
METHODS: Genome-wide association study-based genetic, environmental, and
neurocognitive classifiers were trained to separate 337 HCs from 103
SCZs using support vector classification and repeated nested
cross-validation. We validated classifiers on independent datasets using
within-diagnostic (SCZ) and cross-diagnostic (clinically isolated
syndrome for multiple sclerosis, another condition with cognitive
abnormalities) approaches. Then, we tested whether gene-environment
multivariate stratification modulated the discrimination performance of
the cognitive classifier in iterative subsamples.
RESULTS: The cognitive classifier discriminated SCZs from HCs with a
balanced accuracy (BAC) of 88.7\%, followed by environmental (BAC = 65.1
\%) and genetic (BAC = 55.5\%) classifiers. Similar classification
performance was measured in the within-diagnosis validation sample
(HC-SCZ BACs, cognition = 70.5\%; environment = 65.8\%; genetics =
49.9\%). The cognitive classifier was relatively specific to
schizophrenia (HC-clinically isolated syndrome for multiple sclerosis
BAC = 56.7\%). Combined gene-environment stratification allowed
cognitive features to classify HCs from SCZs with 89.4\% BAC.
CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with cognitive deficits being core features of
the phenotype of SCZs, our results suggest that cognitive features alone
bear the greatest amount of information for classification of SCZs.
Consistent with genes and environment being risk factors,
gene-environment stratification modulates HC-SCZ classification
performance of cognition, perhaps providing another target for refining
early identification and intervention strategies.},

and has an adverse impact on short- and long-term mortality. Early
identification of patients at high risk of CSA-AKI by applying risk
prediction models allows clinicians to closely monitor these patients
and initiate effective preventive and therapeutic approaches to lessen
the incidence of AKI. Several risk prediction models and risk assessment
scores have been developed for CSA-AKI. However, the definition of AKI
and the variables utilized in these risk scores differ, making general
utility complex. Recently, the utility of artificial intelligence
coupled with machine learning, has generated much interest and many
studies in clinical medicine, including CSA-AKI. In this article, we
discussed the evolution of models established by machine learning

 abstract = {Objective: Early detection of mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and
Alzheimer's disease (AD) can increase access to treatment and assist in
advance care planning. However, the development of a diagnostic system
that d7oes not heavily depend on cognitive testing is a major challenge.
We describe a diagnostic algorithm based solely on gait and machine
learning to detect MCI and AD from healthy.
Methods: We collected ``single-tasking{''} gait (walking) and
``dual-tasking{''} gait (walking with cognitive tasks) from 32 healthy,
26 MCI, and 20 AD participants using a computerized walkway. Each
participant was assessed with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA).
A set of gait features (e.g., mean, variance and asymmetry) were
extracted. Significant features for three classifications of
MCI/healthy, AD/healthy, and AD/MCI were identified. A support vector
machine model in a one-vs.-one manner was trained for each
classification, and the majority vote of the three models was assigned
as healthy, MCI, or AD.
Results: The average classification accuracy of 5-fold cross-validation
using only the gait features was 78\% (77\% F1-score), which was
plausible when compared with the MoCA score with 83\% accuracy (84\%
F1-score). The performance of healthy vs. MCI or AD was 86\% (88\%
F1-score), which was comparable to 88\% accuracy (90\% F1-score) with
MoCA.
Conclusion: Our results indicate the potential of machine learning and
gait assessments as objective cognitive screening and diagnostic tools.
Significance: Gait-based cognitive screening can be easily adapted into
clinical settings and may lead to early identification of cognitive
impairment, so that early intervention strategies can be initiated.},

 abstract = {The emergence and continued reliance on the Internet and related
technologies has resulted in the generation of large amounts of data
that can be made available for analyses. However, humans do not possess
the cognitive capabilities to understand such large amounts of data.
Machine learning (ML) provides a mechanism for humans to process large
amounts of data, gain insights about the behavior of the data, and make
more informed decision based on the resulting analysis. ML has
applications in various fields. This review focuses on some of the
fields and applications such as education, healthcare, network security,
banking and finance, and social media. Within these fields, there are
multiple unique challenges that exist. However, ML can provide solutions
to these challenges, as well as create further research opportunities.
Accordingly, this work surveys some of the challenges facing the
aforementioned fields and presents some of the previous literature works
that tackled them. Moreover, it suggests several research opportunities
that benefit from the use of ML to address these challenges.},

 abstract = {Aims Our aim was to evaluate the performance of machine learning (ML),
integrating clinical parameters with coronary artery calcium (CAC), and
automated epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) quantification, for the
prediction of long-term risk of myocardial infarction (MI) and cardiac
death in asymptomatic subjects.
Methods and results Our study included 1912 asymptomatic subjects
{[}1117 (58.4\%) male, age: 55.8 +/- 9.1 years] from the prospective
EISNER trial with long-term follow-up after CAC scoring. EAT volume and
density were quantified using a fully automated deep learning method. ML
extreme gradient boosting was trained using clinical co-variates, plasma
lipid panel measurements, risk factors, CAC, aortic calcium, and
automated EAT measures, and validated using repeated 10-fold cross
validation. During mean follow-up of 14.5 +/- 2 years, 76 events of MI
and/or cardiac death occurred. ML obtained a significantly higher AUC
than atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk and CAC score
for predicting events (ML: 0.82; ASCVD: 0.77; CAC: 0.77, P < 0.05 for
all). Subjects with a higher ML score (by Youden's index) had high
hazard of suffering events (HR: 10.38, P < 0.001); the relationships
persisted in multivariable analysis including ASCVD-risk and CAC
measures (HR: 2.94, P = 0.005). Age, ASCVD-risk, and CAC were
prognostically important for both genders. Systolic blood pressure was
more important than cholesterol in women, and the opposite in men.
Conclusions In this prospective study, machine learning used to
integrate clinical and quantitative imaging-based variables
significantly improves prediction of MI and cardiac death compared with
standard clinical risk assessment. Following further validation, such a
personalized paradigm could potentially be used to improve
cardiovascular risk assessment.

 abstract = {Digital data trails from disparate sources covering different aspects of
student life are stored daily in most modern university campuses.
However, it remains challenging to (i) combine these data to obtain a
holistic view of a student, (ii) use these data to accurately predict
academic performance, and (iii) use such predictions to promote positive
student engagement with the university. To initially alleviate this
problem, in this article, a model named Augmented Education (AugmentED)
is proposed. In our study, (1) first, an experiment is conducted based
on a real-world campus dataset of college students (N =156) that
aggregates multisource behavioral data covering not only online and
offline learning but also behaviors inside and outside of the classroom.
Specifically, to gain in-depth insight into the features leading to
excellent or poor performance, metrics measuring the linear and
nonlinear behavioral changes (e.g., regularity and stability) of campus
lifestyles are estimated; furthermore, features representing dynamic
changes in temporal lifestyle patterns are extracted by the means of
long short-term memory (LSTM). (2) Second, machine learning-based
classification algorithms are developed to predict academic performance.
(3) Finally, visualized feedback enabling students (especially at-risk
students) to potentially optimize their interactions with the university
and achieve a study-life balance is designed. The experiments show that
the AugmentED model can predict students' academic performance with high
accuracy.},

 abstract = {Since its emergence in late 2019, the severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused a pandemic with more than 55
million reported cases and 1.3 million estimated deaths worldwide. While
epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 have been
reported, risk factors underlying the transition from mild to severe
disease among patients remain poorly understood. In this retrospective
study, we analysed data of 879 confirmed SARS-CoV-2 positive patients
admitted to a two-site NHS Trust hospital in London, England, between
January 1st and May 26th, 2020, with a majority of cases occurring in
March and April. We extracted anonymised demographic data, physiological
clinical variables and laboratory results from electronic healthcare
records (EHR) and applied multivariate logistic regression, random
forest and extreme gradient boosted trees. To evaluate the potential for
early risk assessment, we used data available during patients' initial
presentation at the emergency department (ED) to predict deterioration
to one of three clinical endpoints in the remainder of the hospital
stay: admission to intensive care, need for invasive mechanical
ventilation and in-hospital mortality. Based on the trained models, we
extracted the most informative clinical features in determining these
patient trajectories. Considering our inclusion criteria, we have
identified 129 of 879 (15\%) patients that required intensive care, 62
of 878 (7\%) patients needing mechanical ventilation, and 193 of 619
(31\%) cases of in-hospital mortality. Our models learned successfully
from early clinical data and predicted clinical endpoints with high
accuracy, the best model achieving area under the receiver operating
characteristic (AUC-ROC) scores of 0.76 to 0.87 (F1 scores of
0.42-0.60). Younger patient age was associated with an increased risk of
receiving intensive care and ventilation, but lower risk of mortality.
Clinical indicators of a patient's oxygen supply and selected laboratory
results, such as blood lactate and creatinine levels, were most
predictive of COVID-19 patient trajectories. Among COVID-19 patients
machine learning can aid in the early identification of those with a
poor prognosis, using EHR data collected during a patient's first
presentation at ED. Patient age and measures of oxygenation status
during ED stay are primary indicators of poor patient outcomes.},

 abstract = {Falls among the elderly population cause detrimental physical, mental,
financial problems and, in the worst case, death. The increasing number
of people entering the higher risk age-range has increased clinicians'
attention to intervene. Clinical tools, e.g., the Timed Up and Go (TUG)
test, have been created for aiding clinicians in fall-risk assessment.
Often simple to evaluate, these assessments are subject to a clinician's
judgment. Wearable sensor data with machine learning algorithms were
introduced as an alternative to precisely quantify ambulatory kinematics
and predict prospective falls. However, they require a long-term
evaluation of large samples of subjects' locomotion and complex feature
engineering of sensor kinematics. Therefore, it is critical to build an
objective fall-risk detection model that can efficiently measure
biometric risk factors with minimal costs. We built and studied a sensor
data-driven convolutional neural network model to predict older adults'
fall-risk status with relatively high sensitivity to geriatrician's
expert assessment. The sample in this study is representative of older
patients with multiple co-morbidity seen in daily medical practice.
Three non-intrusive wearable sensors were used to measure participants'
gait kinematics during the TUG test. This data collection ensured
convenient capture of various gait impairment aspects at different body
locations.},

 abstract = {Background Thyrotoxic atrial fibrillation (TAF) is a recognized
significant complication of hyperthyroidism. Early identification of the
individuals predisposed to TAF would improve thyrotoxic patients'
management. However, to our knowledge, an instrument that establishes an
individual risk of the condition is unavailable. Therefore, the aim of
this study is to build a TAF prediction model and rank TAF predictors in
order of importance using machine learning techniques. Methods In this
retrospective study, we have investigated 36 demographic and clinical
features for 420 patients with overt hyperthyroidism, 30\% of which had
TAF. At first, the association of these features with TAF was evaluated
by classical statistical methods. Then, we developed several TAF
prediction models with eight different machine learning classifiers and
compared them by performance metrics. The models included ten features
that were selected based on their clinical effectuality and importance
for model output. Finally, we ranked TAF predictors, elicited from the
optimal final model, by the machine learning tehniques. Results The best
performance metrics prediction model was built with the extreme gradient
boosting classifier. It had the reasonable accuracy of 84\% and AUROC of
0.89 on the test set. The model confirmed such well-known TAF risk
factors as age, sex, hyperthyroidism duration, heart rate and some
concomitant cardiovascular diseases (arterial hypertension and
conjestive heart rate). We also identified premature atrial contraction
and premature ventricular contraction as new TAF predictors. The top
five TAF predictors, elicited from the model, included (in order of
importance) PAC, PVC, hyperthyroidism duration, heart rate during
hyperthyroidism and age. Conclusions We developed a machine learning
model for TAF prediction. It seems to be the first available analytical
tool for TAF risk assessment. In addition, we defined five most
important TAF predictors, including premature atrial contraction and
premature ventricular contraction as the new ones. These results have
contributed to TAF prediction investigation and may serve as a basis for
further research focused on TAF prediction improvement and facilitation
of thyrotoxic patients' management.},

 abstract = {Machine learning (ML) has revolutionised data analysis over the past
decade. Like innumerous other industries heavily reliant on accurate
information, banking supervision stands to benefit greatly from this
technological advance. The objective of this review is to provide a
comprehensive walk-through of how the most common ML techniques have
been applied to risk assessment in banking, focusing on a supervisory
perspective. We searched Google Scholar, Springer Link, and
ScienceDirect databases for articles including the search terms
``machine learning{''} and ({''}bank{''} or ``banking{''} or
``supervision{''}). No language, date, or Journal filter was applied.
Papers were then screened and selected according to their relevance. The
final article base consisted of 41 papers and 2 book chapters, 53\% of
which were published in the top quartile journals in their field.
Results are presented in a timeline according to the publication date
and categorised by time slots. Credit risk assessment and stress testing
are highlighted topics as well as other risk perspectives, with some
references to ML application surveys. The most relevant ML techniques
encompass k-nearest neighbours (KNN), support vector machines (SVM),
tree-based models, ensembles, boosting techniques, and artificial neural
networks (ANN). Recent trends include developing early warning systems
(EWS) for bankruptcy and refining stress testing. One limitation of this
study is the paucity of contributions using supervisory data, which
justifies the need for additional investigation in this field. However,
there is increasing evidence that ML techniques can enhance data
analysis and decision making in the banking industry.},

 abstract = {The problems of poor academic performance and lag are recurrent in
higher-level educational institutions, especially at the beginning of
university studies. In the local context, diagnostic analyzes have shown
high failure rates and low academic performance. In this work,
sociodemographic data and admission exam results of 415 students of the
computer science majors of the Autonomous University of Yucatan
(Mexico), enrolled between 2016 and 2019, were used. The objective is to
generate predictive models of academic risk, using educational data
mining methods that serve as tools for early detection of academic risk
conditions and facilitate the deployment of educational intervention
strategies. The stages of the Knowledge Extraction Process in Databases
were followed, specifically, classification techniques were applied for
the analysis, obtaining and validation of the models. The results show
that the best model corresponds to the LMT algorithm, with a precision
value of 75.42\% and 0.805 for the area under the ROC curve. It was
possible to identify the best predictive attributes, particularly the
bachelor entrance exam tests were very significant. The development of
computer tools for the early detection of academic risk and timely
educational intervention strategies is proposed.},

 abstract = {Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common vascular disease and
potentially fatal complication during hospitalization, and so the early
identification of VTE risk is of significant importance. Compared with
traditional scale assessments, machine learning methods provide new
opportunities for precise early warning of VTE from clinical medical
records. This research aimed to propose a two-stage hierarchical machine
learning model for VTE risk prediction in patients from multiple
departments. First, we built a machine learning prediction model that
covered the entire hospital, based on all cohorts and common risk
factors. Then, we took the prediction output of the first stage as an
initial assessment score and then built specific models for each
department. Over the duration of the study, a total of 9213 inpatients,
including 1165 VTE-positive samples, were collected from four
departments, which were split into developing and test datasets. The
proposed model achieved an AUC of 0.879 in the department of oncology,
which outperformed the first-stage model (0.730) and the department
model (0.787). This was attributed to the fully usage of both the large
sample size at the hospital level and variable abundance at the
department level. Experimental results show that our model could
effectively improve the prediction of hospital-acquired VTE risk before
image diagnosis and provide decision support for further nursing and
medical intervention.},

 abstract = {Risk assessment in coronary artery disease plays an essential role in
the early identification of high-risk patients. However, conventional
invasive imaging procedures all require long intraprocedural times and
high costs. The rapid development of coronary computed tomographic
angiography (CCTA) and related image processing technology has
facilitated the formulation of noninvasive approaches to perform
comprehensive evaluations. Evidence has shown that CCTA has outstanding
performance in identifying the degree of stenosis, plaque features, and
functional reserve. Moreover, advancements in radiomics and machine
learning allow more comprehensive interpretations of CCTA images. This
paper reviews conventional as well as novel diagnostic and risk
assessment tools based on CCTA.},

 abstract = {Background \& aims: Refeeding syndrome (RFS) is a disease that occurs
when feeding is restarted and metabolism changes from catabolic to
anabolic status. RFS can manifest variously, ranging from asymptomatic
to fatal, therefore it may easily be overlooked. RFS prediction using
explainable machine learning can improve diagnosis and treatment. Our
study aimed to propose a machine learning model for RFS prediction,
specifically refeeding hypophosphatemia, to evaluate its performance
compared with conventional regression models, and to explain the machine
learning classification through Shapley additive explanations (SHAP)
values.
Methods: A retrospective study was conducted including 806 patients,
with 2 or more days of nothing-by-mouth prescription, and with phosphate
(P) level measurements within 5 days of refeeding were selected. We
divided the patients into hypophosphatemia (n = 367) and
non-hypophosphatemia groups (n = 439) at a P level of 0.8 mmol/L. Among
the features examined within 48 h after admission, we reviewed
laboratory test results and electronic medical records. Logistic, Lasso,
and ridge regressions were used as conventional models, and performances
were compared with our extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) machine
learning model using the area under the receiver operating
characteristic curve. Our model was explained using the SHAP value.
Results: The areas under the curve were 0.950 (95\% confidence interval:
0.924-0.975) for our XGBoost ma-chine learning model and surpassed the
performance of conventional regression models; 0.760 (0.707-0.813) for
logistic regression, 0.751 (0.694-0.807) for Lasso regression, and 0.758
(0.701-0.809) for ridge regression. According to the SHAP values in the
order of importance, low initial P, recent weight loss, high creatinine,
diabetes mellitus with insulin use, low haemoglobin A1c, furosemide use,
intensive care unit admission, blood urea nitrogen level of 19-65,
parenteral nutrition, magnesium below or above the normal range, low
potassium, and older age were features to predict refeeding
hypophosphatemia.
Conclusions: The machine learning model for predicting RFS has a
substantially higher effectiveness than conventional regression methods.
Creating an accurate risk assessment tool based on machine learning for
early identification of patients at risk for RFS can enable careful
nutrition management planning and monitoring in the intensive care unit,
towards reducing the incidence of RFS-related morbidity and mortality.

 abstract = {Automating fall risk assessment, in an efficient, non-invasive manner,
specifically in the elderly population, serves as an efficient means for
implementing wide screening of individuals for fall risk and determining
their need for participation in fall prevention programs. We present an
automated and efficient system for fall risk assessment based on a
multi-depth camera human motion tracking system, which captures patients
performing the well-known and validated Berg Balance Scale (BBS).
Trained machine learning classifiers predict the patient's 14 scores of
the BBS by extracting spatio-temporal features from the captured human
motion records. Additionally, we used machine learning tools to develop
fall risk predictors that enable reducing the number of BBS tasks
required to assess fall risk, from 14 to 4-6 tasks, without compromising
the quality and accuracy of the BBS assessment. The reduced battery,
termed Efficient-BBS (E-BBS), can be performed by physiotherapists in a
traditional setting or deployed using our automated system, allowing an
efficient and effective BBS evaluation. We report on a pilot study, run
in a major hospital, including accuracy and statistical evaluations. We
show the accuracy and confidence levels of the E-BBS, as well as the
average number of BBS tasks required to reach the accuracy thresholds.
The trained E-BBS system was shown to reduce the number of tasks in the
BBS test by approximately 50\% while maintaining 97\% accuracy. The
presented approach enables a wide screening of individuals for fall risk
in a manner that does not require significant time or resources from the
medical community. Furthermore, the technology and machine learning
algorithms can be implemented on other batteries of medical tests and
evaluations.},

 abstract = {Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is one of the most common head and neck
malignancies, and the primary treatment methods are radiotherapy and
chemotherapy. Radiotherapy alone, concurrent chemoradiotherapy, and
induction chemotherapy combined with concurrent chemoradiotherapy can be
used according to different grades. Treatment options and prognoses vary
greatly depending on the grade of disease in the patients. Accurate
grading and risk assessment are required. Recently, radiomics has
combined a large amount of invisible high-dimensional information
extracted from computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, or
positron emission tomography with powerful computing capabilities of
machine-learning algorithms, providing the possibility to achieve an
accurate diagnosis and individualized treatment for cancer patients. As
an effective tumor biomarker of NPC. the radiomic signature has been
widely used in grading. differential diagnosis. prediction of prognosis,
evaluation of treatment response, and early identification of
therapeutic complications. The process of radiomic research includes
image segmentation, feature extraction. feature selection, model
establishment, and evaluation. Many open-source or commercial tools can
be used to achieve these procedures. The development of machine-learning
algorithms provides more possibilities for radiomics research. This
review aimed to summarize the application of radiomics in NPC and
introduce the basic process of radiomics research.},

 abstract = {Blended learning pedagogical practices supported by learning management
systems have become an important part of higher education curricula. In
most cases, these blended curricula are evaluated through multimodal
formative assessments. Although assessments can strongly affect student
outcomes, research on the topic is limited. In this paper, we adopted a
learning analytics approach to explore student engagement with formative
assessments and the power of these assessments to predict student
outcomes in an English for Academic Purposes courses in a Hong Kong
university. The study retrieved the data logs from 7,815 students and
used the data to analyze student engagement with the formative
assessments. The results suggested that the students put effort into
completing the assessments. The degree to which assessments predict
learning outcomes depend on students' level of subject knowledge and
their understanding of the relevance of the assessments. This study
showed that learning analytics provided reliable evidence for
understanding students' engagement and identifying at-risk students.
Therefore, learning analytics research has the potential to inform
pedagogical practice.},

 abstract = {BackgroundPost-operative mortality risk assessment for geriatric
patients with hip fractures (HF) is a challenge for clinicians. Early
identification of geriatric HF patients with a high risk of
post-operative death is helpful for early intervention and improving
clinical prognosis. However, a single significant risk factor of
post-operative death cannot accurately predict the prognosis of
geriatric HF patients. Therefore, our study aims to utilize a machine
learning approach, random forest algorithm, to fabricate a prediction
model for post-operative death of geriatric HF patients. MethodsThis
retrospective study enrolled consecutive geriatric HF patients who
underwent treatment for surgery. The study cohort was divided into
training and testing datasets at a 70:30 ratio. The random forest
algorithm selected or excluded variables according to the feature
importance. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) was
utilized to compare feature selection results of random forest. The
confirmed variables were used to create a simplified model instead of a
full model with all variables. The prediction model was then verified in
the training dataset and testing dataset. Additionally, a prediction
model constructed by logistic regression was used as a control to
evaluate the efficiency of the new prediction model. ResultsFeature
selection by random forest algorithm and Lasso regression demonstrated
that seven variables, including age, time from injury to surgery,
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), albumin, hemoglobin,
history of malignancy, and perioperative blood transfusion, could be
used to predict the 1-year post-operative mortality. The area under the
curve (AUC) of the random forest algorithm-based prediction model in
training and testing datasets were 1.000, and 0.813, respectively. While
the prediction tool constructed by logistic regression in training and
testing datasets were 0.895, and 0.797, respectively.
ConclusionsCompared with logistic regression, the random forest
algorithm-based prediction model exhibits better predictive ability for
geriatric HF patients with a high risk of death within post-operative 1

 abstract = {Background Myocardial infarction can lead to malignant arrhythmia, heart
failure, and sudden death. Clinical studies have shown that early
identification of and timely intervention for acute MI can significantly
reduce mortality. The traditional MI risk assessment models are
subjective, and the data that go into them are difficult to obtain.
Generally, the assessment is only conducted among high-risk patient
groups. Objective To construct an artificial intelligence-based risk
prediction model of myocardial infarction (MI) for continuous and active
monitoring of inpatients, especially those in noncardiovascular
departments, and early warning of MI. Methods The imbalanced data
contain 59 features, which were constructed into a specific dataset
through proportional division, upsampling, downsampling, easy ensemble,
and w-easy ensemble. Then, the dataset was traversed using supervised
machine learning, with recursive feature elimination as the top-layer
algorithm and random forest, gradient boosting decision tree (GBDT),
logistic regression, and support vector machine as the bottom-layer
algorithms, to select the best model out of many through a variety of
evaluation indices. Results GBDT was the best bottom-layer algorithm,
and downsampling was the best dataset construction method. In the
validation set, the F1 score and accuracy of the 24-feature downsampling
GBDT model were both 0.84. In the test set, the F1 score and accuracy of
the 24-feature downsampling GBDT model were both 0.83, and the area
under the curve was 0.91. Conclusion Compared with traditional models,
artificial intelligence-based machine learning models have better
accuracy and real-time performance and can reduce the occurrence of
in-hospital MI from a data-driven perspective, thereby increasing the
cure rate of patients and improving their prognosis.},

 abstract = {Previous studies have proposed many indicators to assess the effect of
student engagement in learning and academic achievement but have not yet
been clearly articulated. In addition, while student engagement tracking
systems have been designed, they rely on the log data but not on
performance data. This paper presents results of a non-machine learning
model developed using ongoing formative assessment scores as indicators
of student engagement. Visualisation of the classification tree results
is employed as student engagement indicators for instructors to observe
and intervene with students. The results of this study showed that
ongoing assessment is related to student engagement and subsequent final
programming exam performance and possible to identify students at-risk
of failing the final exam. Finally, our study identified students
impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic. These were students who attended the
final programming exam in the semester 2019-2020 and who scored well in
formative assessments. Based on these results we present a simple
student engagement indicator and its potential application as a student
progress monitor for early identification of students at risk.},

 abstract = {Early identification of individuals at high risk of diabetes is crucial
for implementing early intervention strategies. However, algorithms
specific to elderly Chinese adults are lacking. The aim of this study is
to build effective prediction models based on machine learning (ML) for
the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in Chinese elderly. A
retrospective cohort study was conducted using the health screening data
of adults older than 65 years in Wuhan, China from 2018 to 2020. With a
strict data filtration, 127,031 records from the eligible participants
were utilized. Overall, 8298 participants were diagnosed with incident
T2DM during the 2-year follow-up (2019-2020). The dataset was randomly
split into training set (n = 101,625) and test set (n = 25,406). We
developed prediction models based on four ML algorithms: logistic
regression (LR), decision tree (DT), random forest (RF), and extreme
gradient boosting (XGBoost). Using LASSO regression, 21 prediction
features were selected. The Random under-sampling (RUS) was applied to
address the class imbalance, and the Shapley Additive Explanations
(SHAP) was used to calculate and visualize feature importance. Model
performance was evaluated by the area under the receiver operating
characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. The
XGBoost model achieved the best performance (AUC = 0.7805, sensitivity =
0.6452, specificity = 0.7577, accuracy = 0.7503). Fasting plasma glucose
(FPG), education, exercise, gender, and waist circumference (WC) were
the top five important predictors. This study showed that XGBoost model
can be applied to screen individuals at high risk of T2DM in the early
phrase, which has the strong potential for intelligent prevention and
control of diabetes. The key features could also be useful for
developing targeted diabetes prevention interventions.},

 abstract = {With the accelerated digital transformation, food security data is
exponentially growing, making it difficult to process and analyze data
as the primary challenge for food security risk regulation. The
promotion of ``big data + food{''} safety supervision can effectively
reduce supervision costs and improve the efficiency of risk detection
and response. In order to improve the utilization of testing data and
achieve rapid risk assessment, this paper proposes a rice security risk
assessment method based on the fusion of multiple machine learning
models, and conducts experimental validation based on rice hazard
detection data from 31 provinces in China excluding Hong Kong, Macao and
Taiwan in 2018. The model comparison verifies that the risk assessment
model shows better performance than other mainstream machine learning
algorithms, and its evaluation accuracy is as high as 99.54\%, which
verifies that the model proposed in this paper is more stable and
accurate, and can provide accurate and efficient decision-making basis
for regulatory authorities.},

 abstract = {Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is a common cardiovascular disorder that
is frequently underdiagnosed, which can lead to poorer outcomes due to
lower rates of medical optimization. We aimed to develop an automated
tool to identify undiagnosed PAD and evaluate physician acceptance of a
dashboard representation of risk assessment. Data were derived from
electronic health records (EHR). We developed and compared traditional
risk score models to novel machine learning models. For usability
testing, primary and specialty care physicians were recruited and
interviewed until thematic saturation. Data from 3168 patients with PAD
and 16,863 controls were utilized. Results showed a deep learning model
that utilized time engineered features outperformed random forest and
traditional logistic regression models (average AUCs 0.96, 0.91 and
0.81, respectively), P < 0.0001. Of interviewed physicians, 75\% were
receptive to an EHR-based automated PAD model. Feedback emphasized
workflow optimization, including integrating risk assessments directly
into the EHR, using dashboard designs that minimize clicks, and
providing risk assessments for clinically complex patients. In
conclusion, we demonstrate that EHR-based machine learning models can
accurately detect risk of PAD and that physicians are receptive to
automated risk detection for PAD. Future research aims to prospectively
validate model performance and impact on patient outcomes.},

@article{WOS:000837500600001,
 abstract = {Aims Sarcopenia is characterized by a gradual loss of skeletal muscle
mass and strength with increased adverse outcomes. Recently, large-scale
epidemiological studies have demonstrated a relationship between several
chronic disorders and ocular pathological conditions using an oculomics
approach. We hypothesized that sarcopenia can be predicted through eye
examinations, without invasive tests or radiologic evaluations in the
context of predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine (PPPM/3PM).
Methods We analyzed data from the Korean National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (KNHANES). The training set (80\%, randomly selected
from 2008 to 2010) data were used to construct the machine learning
models. Internal (20\%, randomly selected from 2008 to 2010) and
external (from the KNHANES 2011) validation sets were used to assess the
ability to predict sarcopenia. We included 8092 participants in the
final dataset. Machine learning models (XGBoost) were trained on
ophthalmological examinations and demographic factors to detect
sarcopenia.
Results In the exploratory analysis, decreased levator function (odds
ratio {[}OR], 1.41; P value <0.001), cataracts (OR, 1.31; P value =
0.013), and age-related macular degeneration (OR, 1.38; P value = 0.026)
were associated with an increased risk of sarcopenia in men. In women,
an increased risk of sarcopenia was associated with blepharoptosis (OR,
1.23; P value = 0.038) and cataracts (OR, 1.29; P value = 0.010). The
XGBoost technique showed areas under the receiver operating
characteristic curves (AUCs) of 0.746 and 0.762 in men and women,
respectively. The external validation achieved AUCs of 0.751 and 0.785
for men and women, respectively. For practical and fast hands-on
experience with the predictive model for practitioners who may be
willing to test the whole idea of sarcopenia prediction based on
oculomics data, we developed a simple web-based calculator application
(hutps://kilhanesoculomics.githubdo/sarcopenia) to predict the risk of
sarcopenia and facilitate screening, based on the model established in
this study.
Conclusion Sarcopenia is treatable before the vicious cycle of
sarcopenia-related deterioration begins. Therefore, early identification
of individuals at a high risk of sarcopenia is essential in the context
of PPPM. Our oculomics-based approach provides an effective strategy for
sarcopenia prediction. The proposed method shows promise in
significantly increasing the number of patients diagnosed with
sarcopenia, potentially facilitating earlier intervention. Through
patient oculometric monitoring, various pathological factors related to
sarcopenia can be simultaneously analyzed, and doctors can provide
personalized medical services according to each cause. Further studies
are needed to confirm whether such a prediction algorithm can be used in
real-world clinical settings to improve the diagnosis of sarcopenia.},

 abstract = {Aim: Postoperative pulmonary complications (PPCs) can increase the risk
of postoperative mortality, and the geriatric population has high
incidence of PPCs. Early identification of high-risk geriatric patients
is of great value for clinical decision making and prognosis
improvement. Existing prediction models are based purely on structured
data, and they lack predictive accuracy in geriatric patients. We aimed
to develop and validate a deep neural network model based on combined
natural language data and structured data for improving the prediction
of PPCs in geriatric patients. Methods: We consecutively enrolled
patients aged \& GE;65 years who underwent surgery under general
anesthesia at seven hospitals in China. Data from the West China
Hospital of Sichuan University were used as the derivation dataset, and
a deep neural network model was developed based on combined natural
language data and structured data. Data from the six other hospitals
were combined for external validation. Results: The derivation dataset
included 12,240 geriatric patients, and 1949(15.9\%) patients developed
PPCs. Our deep neural network model outperformed other machine learning
models with an area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) of
0.657(95\% confidence interval {[}CI], 0.655-0.658) and an area under
the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.884(95\% CI,
0.883-0.885). The external dataset included 7579 patients, and
776(10.2\%) patients developed PPCs. In external validation, the AUPRC
was 0.632(95\%CI, 0.632-0.633) and the AUROC was 0.889(95\%CI,
0.888-0.889). Conclusions: This study indicated that the deep neural
network model based on combined natural language data and structured
data could improve the prediction of PPCs in geriatric patients.},

 abstract = {Developing flood hazard risk assessments is vital in early warning
systems to mitigate damage resulting from floods. However, assessing
flood risk zones is difficult because of complex physical processes. In
this study, a two-step flood hazard zoning model based on the random
forest (RF) and self-organizing map (SOM) is proposed to yield the flood
hazard zones map. In the first step (flood susceptibility analysis), the
flood conditioning factors are used to obtain the flood susceptibility
values. In the second step (flood hazard zoning), the proposed model not
only considers the flood susceptibility value of the self-pixel as the
module input, but also simultaneously considers flood susceptibility
values of surrounding pixels to yield the flood hazard zoning map. The
proposed model was applied to the Lanyang Plain in Yilan County, Taiwan,
to demonstrate its advantages. The results indicated that the proposed
model with the flood susceptibility values of the self-pixel and
surrounding pixels does improve the assessment performance,
significantly improving percentage of the effective ratio (ER) from
results for the very high and high-risk level zones is 6 and 46\%,
respectively. The ER of the proposed model also improved by 9.6 and 30\%
for the very high and high-risk level zones than the conventional model,
and it could provide optimal flood hazard zoning maps. In conclusion,
the proposed model is expected to be useful in supporting the
formulation of adequate disaster mitigation strategies.},

 abstract = {Research has posited that machine learning could improve suicide risk
prediction models, which have tradi-tionally performed poorly. This
systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the performance of machine
learning models in predicting longitudinal outcomes of suicide-related
outcomes of ideation, attempt, and death and examines outcome, data, and
model types as potential covariates of model performance. Studies were
extracted from PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and PsycINFO. A bivariate
mixed effects meta-analysis and meta-regression analyses were performed
for studies using machine learning to predict future events of suicidal
ideation, attempts, and/or deaths. Risk of bias was assessed for each
study using an adaptation of the Prediction model Risk Of Bias
Assessment Tool. Narrative review included 56 studies, and analyses
examined 54 models from 35 studies. The models achieved a very good
pooled AUC of 0.86, sensitivity of 0.66 (95\% CI {[}0.60, 0.72)], and
specificity of 0.87 (95\% CI {[}0.84, 0.90]). Pooled AUCs for ideation,
attempt, and death were similar at 0.88, 0.87, and 0.84 respectively.
Model performance was highly varied; however, meta-regressions did not
provide evidence that performance varied by outcome, data, or model
types. Findings suggest that machine learning has the potential to
improve suicide risk detection, with pooled estimates of machine
learning performance comparing favourably to performance of traditional
suicide prediction models. However, more studies with lower risk of bias
are necessary to improve the application of machine learning in
suicidology.},

 abstract = {Cardiac surgery-associated acute kidney injury (CSA-AKI) is the most
prevalent major complication of cardiac surgery and exerts a negative
effect on a patient's prognosis, thereby leading to mortality. Although
several risk assessment models have been developed for patients
undergoing cardiac surgery, their performances are unsatisfactory. In
this study, a machine learning algorithm was employed to obtain better
predictive power for CSA-AKI outcomes relative to statistical analysis.
In addition, random forest (RF), logistic regression with LASSO
regularization, extreme gradient boosting (Xgboost), and support vector
machine (SVM) methods were employed for feature selection and model
training. Moreover, the calibration capacity and differentiation ability
of the model was assessed using net reclassification improvement (NRI)
along with Brier scores and receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
curves, respectively. A total of 44 patients suffered AKI after surgery.
Fatty acid-binding protein (FABP), hemojuvelin (HJV), neutrophil
gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), mechanical ventilation time, and
troponin I (TnI) were correlated significantly with the incidence of
AKI. RF was the best model for predicting AKI (Brier score: 0.137, NRI:
0.221), evidenced by an AUC value of 0.858 {[}95\% confidence interval
(CI): 0.792-0.923]. Overall, RF exhibited the best performance as
compared to other machine learning algorithms. These results thus
provide new insights into the early identification of CSA-AKI.},

 abstract = {Cancer is a complicated global health concern with a significant
fatality rate. Breast cancer is among the leading causes of mortality
each year. Advancements in prognoses have been progressively based
primarily on the expression of genes, offering insight into robust and
appropriate healthcare decisions, owing to the fast growth of advanced
throughput sequencing techniques and the use of various deep learning
approaches that have arisen in the past few years. Diagnostic-imaging
disease indicators such as breast density and tissue texture are widely
used by physicians and automated technology. The effective and specific
identification of cancer risk presence can be used to inform tailored
screening and preventive decisions. For several classifications and
prediction applications, such as breast imaging, deep learning has
increasingly emerged as an effective method. We present a deep learning
model approach for predicting breast cancer risk primarily on this
foundation. The proposed methodology is based on transfer learning using
the InceptionResNetV2 deep learning model. Our experimental work on a
breast cancer dataset demonstrates high model performance, with 91\%
accuracy. The proposed model includes risk markers that are used to
improve breast cancer risk assessment scores and presents promising
results compared to existing approaches. Deep learning models include
risk markers that are used to improve accuracy scores. This article
depicts breast cancer risk indicators, defines the proper usage,
features, and limits of each risk forecasting model, and examines the
increasing role of deep learning (DL) in risk detection. The proposed
model could potentially be used to automate various types of medical
imaging techniques.},

 abstract = {As a cutting-edge field of artificial intelligence in education (AIEd)
that depends on advanced computing technologies, AI performance
prediction model is widely used to identify at-risk students that tend
to fail, establish student-centered learning pathways, and optimize
instructional design and development. A majority of the existing AI
prediction models focus on the development and optimization of the
accuracy of AI algorithms rather than applying AI models to provide
student with in-time and continuous feedback and improve the students'
learning quality. To fill this gap, this research integrated an AI
performance prediction model with learning analytics approaches with a
goal to improve student learning effects in a collaborative learning
context. Quasi-experimental research was conducted in an online
engineering course to examine the differences of students' collaborative
learning effect with and without the support of the integrated approach.
Results showed that the integrated approach increased student
engagement, improved collaborative learning performances, and strengthen
student satisfactions about learning. This research made contributions
to proposing an integrated approach of AI models and learning analytics
(LA) feedback and providing paradigmatic implications for future
development of AI-driven learning analytics.},

of machine learning techniques. Methods:Data from the 2016-2018
Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring System, a cross-sectional survey
matched with birth certificate data, were used. Six US
states/jurisdictions included the outcome help-seeking for postpartum
depression symptoms and were used in the analysis. An ensemble method,
``Super Learner,{''} was used to identify the best combination of
algorithms and most important variables that predict help-seeking among
1920 recently pregnant people who screen positive for postpartum
depression symptoms. Results:The Super Learner predicted well and had an
area under the receiver operating curve of 87.95\%. It outperformed the
highest weighted algorithms which were conditional random forest and
stochastic gradient boosting. The following variables were consistently
among the top 10 most important variables across the algorithms for
predicting increased help-seeking: participants who reported having been
diagnosed with postpartum depression, having depression during
pregnancy, living in particular US states, being a White compared to
Black or Asian American individual, and having a higher maternal body
mass index at the time of the survey. Conclusion:These results show the
utility of using ensemble machine learning techniques to examine complex
topics like help-seeking. Healthcare providers should consider the
factors identified in this study when screening and conducting outreach
and follow-up for postpartum depression symptoms.},

 abstract = {Objective: To review and evaluate existing risk assessment tools for
intensive care unitreadmission.Methods: Nine electronic databases
(Medline, CINAHL, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Embase, Sino Med,
CNKI, VIP, and Wan fang) were systematically searched from their
inception to September 2022. Two authors independently extracted data
from the literature included. Meta-analysis was performed under the
bivariate modeling and summary receiver operating characteristic curve
method.Results: A total of 29 studies were included in this review,
among which 11 were quantitatively Meta-analyzed. The results showed
Stability and Workload Index for Transfer: Sensitivity = 0.55,
Specificity = 0.65, Area under curve = 0.63. And Early warning score:
Sensitivity = 0.78, Specificity = 0.83, Area under curve = 0.88. The
remaining tools included scores, nomograms, machine learning models, and
deep learning models. These studies, with varying reports on thresholds,
case selection, data preprocessing, and model performance, have a high
risk of bias.Conclusion: We cannot identify a tool that can be used
directly in intensive care unit readmission risk assessment. Scores
based on early warning score are moderately accurate in predicting
readmission, but there is heteroge-neity and publication bias that
requires model adjustment for local factors such as resources,
demographics, and case mix. Machine learning models present a promising
modeling technique but have a high methodological bias and require
further validation.Implications for clinical practice: Using reliable
risk assessment tools is essential for the early identification of
unplanned intensive care unit readmission risk in critically ill
patients. A reliable risk assessment tool must be developed, which is
the focus of further research.},

 abstract = {For severe cerebrovascular diseases such as stroke, the prediction of
short-term mortality of patients has tremendous medical significance. In
this study, we combined machine learning models Random Forest classifier
(RF), Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), Extremely Randomised Trees
(ExtraTree) classifier, XGBoost classifier, TabNet, and DistilBERT to
construct a multi-level prediction model that used bioassay data and
radiology text reports from haemorrhagic and ischaemic stroke patients
to predict six-month mortality. The performances of the prediction
models were measured using the area under the receiver operating
characteristic curve (AUROC), the area under the precision-recall curve
(AUPRC), precision, recall, and F1-score. The prediction models were
built with the use of data from 19,616 haemorrhagic stroke patients and
50,178 ischaemic stroke patients. Novel sixmonth mortality prediction
models for these patients were developed, which enhanced the performance
of the prediction models by combining laboratory test data, structured
data, and textual radiology report data. The achieved performances were
as follows: AUROC = 0.89, AUPRC = 0.70, precision = 0.52, recall = 0.78,
and F1 score = 0.63 for haemorrhagic patients, and AUROC = 0.88, AUPRC =
0.54, precision = 0.34, recall = 0.80, and F1 score = 0.48 for ischaemic
patients. Such models could be used for mortality risk assessment and
early identification of high-risk stroke patients. This could contribute
to more efficient utilisation of healthcare resources for stroke
survivors.},

 abstract = {BackgroundClinical practice guidelines recommend early identification of
cognitive impairment in individuals with hypertension with the help of
risk prediction tools based on risk factors. ObjectiveThe aim of this
study was to develop a superior machine learning model based on easily
collected variables to predict the risk of early cognitive impairment in
hypertensive individuals, which could be used to optimize early
cognitive impairment risk assessment strategies. MethodsFor this
cross-sectional study, 733 patients with hypertension (aged 30-85,
48.98\% male) enrolled in multi-center hospitals in China were divided
into a training group (70\%) and a validation group (30\%). After least
absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis
with 5-fold cross-validation determined the modeling variables, three
machine learning classifiers, logistic regression (LR), XGBoost (XGB),
and gaussian naive bayes (GNB), were developed. The area under the ROC
curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score were used
to evaluate the model performance. Shape Additive explanation (SHAP)
analysis was performed to rank feature importance. Further decision
curve analysis (DCA) assessed the clinical performance of the
established model and visualized it by nomogram. ResultsHip
circumference, age, education levels, and physical activity were
considered significant predictors of early cognitive impairment in
hypertension. The AUC (0.88), F1 score (0.59), accuracy (0.81),
sensitivity (0.84), and specificity (0.80) of the XGB model were
superior to LR and GNB classifiers. ConclusionThe XGB model based on hip
circumference, age, educational level, and physical activity has
superior predictive performance and it shows promise in predicting the
risk of cognitive impairment in hypertensive clinical settings.},

 abstract = {The utilization of learning analytics to identify at-risk students for
early intervention has exhibited promising results. However, most
predictive models utilized to address this issue have been based on
non-probabilistic machine learning models. In response, this study
incorporated probabilistic machine learning for two reasons: (1) to
facilitate the inclusion of domain knowledge, and (2) to enable the
quantification of uncertainty in model parameters and predictions. The
study developed a five-stage, probabilistic logistic regression model to
identify at-risk students at different stages throughout the academic
calendar. Rather than predicting a student's final or exam mark, the
model was focused on predicting the at-risk probabilities for subsequent
assessments-specifically, the probability of a student failing an
upcoming assessment. The model incorporated student engagement data from
Moodle, as well as demographic and student performance data. The study's
findings indicate that the significance and certainty of student
engagement and demographic variables decreased after incorporating
student-performance variables, such as assignments and tests. The most
effective week for identifying at-risk students was found to be week 6,
when the accuracy was 92.81\%. Furthermore, the average level of
uncertainty exhibited by the models decreased by 60\% from stage 3 to 5,
indicating more reliable predictions at later than earlier stages. The
study highlights the potential of a probabilistic machine learning model
to aid instructors and practitioners in identifying at-risk students,
and thereby to enhance academic outcomes.},

 abstract = {Background: Long-term exposure to inorganic arsenic may lead to
arsenicosis. There are, however, currently no vali-dated metabolic
biomarkers used for the identification of arsenicosis risk. This study
aims to identify metabolites as-sociated with arsenicosis and establish
prediction models for risk assessment based on untargeted metabolomics
and machine learning algorithms.Methods: In total, 105 coal-borne
arsenicosis patients, with 35 subjects in each of the mild, moderate,
and severe sub-groups according to their symptom severity, and 60
healthy residents were enrolled from Guizhou, China. Ultra-high
performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometer (UHPLC-MS/MS)
was utilized to acquire the plasma metabolic profiles of the studied
subjects. Statistical analysis was used to identify disease-associated
metabolites. Ma-chine learning algorithms and the identified metabolic
biomarkers were resorted to assess the arsenicosis risk. Results: A
total of 143 metabolic biomarkers, with organic acids being the
majority, were identified to be closely asso-ciated with arsenicosis,
and the most involved pathway was glycine, serine, and threonine
metabolism. Comparative analysis of metabolites in arsenicosis patients
with different symptom severity revealed 422 altered molecules, where
disrupted metabolism of beta-alanine and arginine demonstrated the most
significance. For risk assessment, the model established by a single
biomarker (L-carnosine) could undoubtedly discriminate arsenicosis
patients from the healthy. For classifying arsenicosis patients with
different severity, the model established using 52 metabolites and
linear discriminate analysis (LDA) algorithm yielded an accuracy of
0.970-0.979 on calibration set (n = 132) and 0.818-0.848 on validation
set (n = 33).Conclusion: Altered metabolites and disrupted pathways are
prevalent in arsenicosis patients; The disrupted metabo-lism of one
carbon and dysfunction of antioxidant defense system may partially be
causes of the systematic multi -organ damage and carcinogenesis in
arsenicosis patients; Metabolic biomarkers, combined with machine
learning al-gorithms, could be efficient for risk assessment and early
identification of arsenicosis.},

 abstract = {BackgroundBreast cancer (BC) is the most common cancer and the second
leading cause of cancer death in women; an estimated one in eight women
in the USA will develop BC during her lifetime. However, current methods
of BC screening, including clinical breast exams, mammograms, biopsies
and others, are often underused due to limited access, expense and a
lack of risk awareness, causing 30\% (up to 80\% in low-income and
middle-income countries) of patients with BC to miss the precious early
detection phase. MethodsThis study creates a key step to supplement the
current BC diagnostic pipeline: a prescreening platform, prior to
traditional detection and diagnostic steps. We have developed BREast
CAncer Risk Detection Application (BRECARDA), a novel framework that
personalises BC risk assessment using artificial intelligence neural
networks to incorporate relevant genetic and non-genetic risk factors. A
polygenic risk score (PRS) was enhanced by employing AnnoPred and
validated by fivefolds cross-validation, outperforming three existing
state-of-the-art PRS methods. ResultsWe used data from 97 597 female
participants of the UK BioBank to train our algorithm. Using the
enhanced PRS thus trained together with non-genetic information,
BRECARDA was evaluated in a testing dataset with 48 074 UK Biobank
female participants and achieved a high accuracy of 94.28\% and area
under the curve of 0.7861. Our optimised AnnoPred outperformed other
state-of-the-art methods on quantifying genetic risk, indicating its
potential for supplementing the current BC detection tests, population
screening and risk evaluation. ConclusionBRECARDA can enhance disease
risk prediction, identify high-risk individuals for BC screening,
facilitate disease diagnosis and improve population-level screening
efficiency. It can serve as a valuable and supplemental platform to
assist doctors in BC diagnosis and evaluation.},

 abstract = {BackgroundMultiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) is one of the
leading causes of death in critically ill patients. MODS is the result
of a dysregulated inflammatory response that can be triggered by various
causes. Owing to the lack of an effective treatment for patients with
MODS, early identification and intervention are the most effective
strategies. Therefore, we have developed a variety of early warning
models whose prediction results can be interpreted by Kernel SHapley
Additive exPlanations (Kernel-SHAP) and reversed by diverse
counterfactual explanations (DiCE). So we can predict the probability of
MODS 12 h in advance, quantify the risk factors, and automatically
recommend relevant interventions.MethodsWe used various machine learning
algorithms to complete the early risk assessment of MODS, and used a
stacked ensemble to improve the prediction performance. The kernel-SHAP
algorithm was used to quantify the positive and minus factors
corresponding to the individual prediction results, and finally, the
DiCE method was used to automatically recommend interventions. We
completed the model training and testing based on the MIMIC-III and
MIMIC-IV databases, in which the sample features in the model training
included the patients' vital signs, laboratory test results, test
reports, and data related to the use of ventilators.ResultsThe
customizable model called SuperLearner, which integrated multiple
machine learning algorithms, had the highest authenticity of screening,
and its Yordon index (YI), sensitivity, accuracy, and utility\_score on
the MIMIC-IV test set were 0.813, 0.884, 0.893, and 0.763, respectively,
which were all maximum values of eleven models. The area under the curve
of the deep-wide neural network (DWNN) model on the MIMIC-IV test set
was 0.960, and the specificity was 0.935, which were both the maximum
values of all these models. The Kernel-SHAP algorithm combined with
SuperLearner was used to determine the minimum value of glasgow coma
scale (GCS) in the current hour (OR = 0.609, 95\% CI 0.606-0.612),
maximum value of MODS score corresponding to GCS in the past 24 h (OR =
2.632, 95\% CI 2.588-2.676), and maximum score of MODS corresponding to
creatinine in the past 24 h (OR = 3.281, 95\% CI 3.267-3.295) were
generally the most influential factors.ConclusionThe MODS early warning
model based on machine learning algorithms has considerable application
value, and the prediction efficiency of SuperLearner is superior to
those of SubSuperLearner, DWNN, and other eight common machine learning
models. Considering that the attribution analysis of Kernel-SHAP is a
static analysis of the prediction results, we introduce the DiCE
algorithm to automatically recommend counterfactuals to reverse the
prediction results, which will be an important step towards the
practical application of automatic MODS early intervention.},

 abstract = {During a pandemic, medical specialists have substantial challenges in
discovering and validating new disease risk factors and designing
effective treatment strategies. Traditionally, this approach entails
several clinical studies and trials that might last several years,
during which strict preventive measures are enforced to manage the
outbreak and limit the death toll. Advanced data analytics technologies,
on the other hand, could be utilized to monitor and expedite the
procedure. This research integrates evolutionary search algorithms,
Bayesian belief networks, and innovative interpretation techniques to
provide a comprehensive exploratory-descriptive-explanatory machine
learning methodology to assist clinical decision-makers in responding
promptly to pandemic scenarios. The proposed approach is illustrated
through a case study in which the survival of COVID-19 patients is
determined using inpatient and emergency department (ED) encounters from
a real-world electronic health record database. Following an exploratory
phase in which genetic algorithms are used to identify a set of the most
critical chronic risk factors and their validation using descriptive
tools based on the concept of Bayesian Belief Nets, the framework
develops and trains a probabilistic graphical model to explain and
predict patient survival (with an AUC of 0.92). Finally, a publicly
available online, probabilistic decision support inference simulator was
constructed to facilitate what-if analysis and aid general users and
healthcare professionals in interpreting model findings. The results
widely corroborate intensive and expensive clinical trial research
assessments.},

 abstract = {Simple Summary Childhood cancer survivors are often prone to
experiencing late effects due to treatment complications. Valvular Heart
Disease is a known iatrogenic effect of radiation leakage to the heart
during radiotherapy and is often linked with the occurrence of other
cardiac diseases like heart failure. Early identification and treatment
of survivors prone to develop valvular heart disease is an important
public health issue that remains challenging. In the FCCSS, a
voxel-scaled reconstruction of radiation dose to the heart is available
for patients that had been treated with radiotherapy. This type of
uncommon data allows us to take into consideration information on the
dose level that was absorbed by the cardiac tissues, as well as on the
spatial characteristics of radiation dose distribution to the heart.
With the help of machine learning algorithms, we attempted to train
models capable of accurately predicting survivors high at risk of
experiencing a late valvular heart disease after radiotherapy for
childhood cancer. We suggest that there is an underlying association of
the radiation dose with the occurrence of a valvular heart disease that
goes beyond the mean dose to the heart and can be explained by the
combination of spatial and descriptive features of the dose. Valvular
Heart Disease (VHD) is a known late complication of radiotherapy for
childhood cancer (CC), and identifying high-risk survivors correctly
remains a challenge. This paper focuses on the distribution of the
radiation dose absorbed by heart tissues. We propose that a dosiomics
signature could provide insight into the spatial characteristics of the
heart dose associated with a VHD, beyond the already-established risk
induced by high doses. We analyzed data from the 7670 survivors of the
French Childhood Cancer Survivors' Study (FCCSS), 3902 of whom were
treated with radiotherapy. In all, 63 (1.6\%) survivors that had been
treated with radiotherapy experienced a VHD, and 57 of them had
heterogeneous heart doses. From the heart-dose distribution of each
survivor, we extracted 93 first-order and spatial dosiomics features. We
trained random forest algorithms adapted for imbalanced classification
and evaluated their predictive performance compared to the performance
of standard mean heart dose (MHD)-based models. Sensitivity analyses
were also conducted for sub-populations of survivors with spatially
heterogeneous heart doses. Our results suggest that MHD and
dosiomics-based models performed equally well globally in our cohort and
that, when considering the sub-population having received a spatially
heterogeneous dose distribution, the predictive capability of the models
is significantly improved by the use of the dosiomics features. If these
findings are further validated, the dosiomics signature may be
incorporated into machine learning algorithms for radiation-induced VHD
risk assessment and, in turn, into the personalized refinement of
follow-up guidelines.},

 abstract = {Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common complication after a surgery,
especially in cardiac and aortic procedures, and has a sig-nificant
impact on morbidity and mortality. Early identification of high-risk
patients and providing effective prevention and ther-apeutic approach
are the main strategies for reducing the possibility of perioperative
AKI. Consequently, several risk-prediction models and risk assessment
scores have been developed for the prediction of perioperative AKI.
However, a majority of these risk scores are only derived from
preoperative data while the intraoperative time-series monitoring data
such as heart rate and blood pressure were not included. Moreover, the
complexity of the pathophysiology of AKI, as well as its nonlinear and
hetero-geneous nature, imposes limitations on the use of linear
statistical techniques. The development of clinical medicine's
digitiza-tion, the widespread availability of electronic medical
records, and the increase in the use of continuous monitoring have
generated vast quantities of data. Machine learning has recently shown
promise as a method for automatically integrating large amounts of data
in predicting the risk of perioperative outcomes. In this article, we
discussed the development, limitations of existing work, and the
potential future direction of models using machine learning techniques
to predict AKI after a surgery.\& COPY; 2022 by the National Kidney

 abstract = {Background: Early identification of individuals at high risk for
developing cardiovascular (CV) events is of para-mount importance for
efficient risk management. Here, the authors investigated whether using
unsupervised machine learning methods on time-series data of left atrial
(LA) strain could distinguish clinically meaningful phenogroups
associated with the risk for developing adverse events. Methods: In 929
community-dwelling individuals (mean age, 51.6 years; 52.9\% women),
clinical and echocardio-graphic data were acquired, including LA strain
traces, at baseline, and cardiac events were collected on average 6.3
years later. Two unsupervised learning techniques were used: (1) an
ensemble of a deep convolutional neural network autoencoder with
k-medoids and (2) a self-organizing map to cluster spatiotemporal
patterns within LA strain curves. Clinical characteristics and cardiac
outcome were used to evaluate the validity of the k clusters us-ing the
original cohort, while an external population cohort (n = 378) was used
to validate the trained models. Results: In both approaches, the optimal
number of clusters was five. The first three clusters had differences in
sex distribution and heart rate but had a similar low CV risk profile.
On the other hand, cluster 5 had the worst CV profile and a higher
prevalence of left ventricular remodeling and diastolic dysfunction
compared with the other clusters. The respective indexes of cluster 4
were between those of clusters 1 to 3 and 5. After adjust-ment for
traditional risk factors, cluster 5 had the highest risk for cardiac
events compared with clusters 1, 2, and 3 (hazard ratio, 1.36; 95\% CI,
1.09-1.70; P = .0063). Similar LA strain patterns were obtained when the
models were applied to the external validation cohort, and clinical
characteristics revealed similar CV risk profiles across all clusters.
Conclusion: Unsupervised machine learning algorithms used in time-series
LA strain curves identified clinically meaningful clusters of LA
deformation and provide incremental prognostic information over
traditional risk factors. (J Am Soc Echocardiogr 2023;36:778-87.)},

 abstract = {Apart from good instructional design and delivery, effective
intervention is another key to strengthen student academic performance.
However, intervention has been recognized as a great challenge. Most
instructors struggle to identify at-risk students, determine a proper
intervention approach, trace and evaluate whether the intervention
works. This process requires extensive effort and commitment, which is
impractical especially for large classes with few instructors. This
paper proposes a platform, namely i-Ntervene, that integrates Learning
Management System (LMS) automatic code grader, and learning analytics
features which can empower systematic learning intervention for large
programming classes. The platform supports instructor-pace courses on
both Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) and traditional classroom
setting. The platform iteratively assesses student engagement levels
through learning activity gaps. It also analyzes subject understanding
from programming question practices to identify at-risk students and
suggests aspects of intervention based on their lagging in these areas.
Students' post-intervention data are traced and evaluated quantitatively
to determine effective intervention approaches. This evaluation method
aligns with the evidence-based research design. The developed i-Ntervene
prototype was tested on a Java programming course with 253 first-year
university students during the Covid-19 pandemic in VLE. The result was
satisfactory, as the instructors were able to perform and evaluate 12
interventions throughout a semester. For this experimental course, the
platform revealed that the approach of sending extrinsic motivation
emails had more impact in promoting learning behavior compared to other
types of messages. It also showed that providing tutorial sessions was
not an effective approach to improving students' subject understanding
in complex algorithmic topics. i-Ntervene allows instructors to flexibly
trial potential interventions to discover the optimal approach for their
course settings which should boost student's learning outcomes in long
term.},

 abstract = {PurposeIn-hospital health-related adverse events (HAEs) are a major
concern for hospitals worldwide. In high-income countries, approximately
1 in 10 patients experience HAEs associated with their hospital stay.
Estimating the risk of an HAE at the individual patient level as
accurately as possible is one of the first steps towards improving
patient outcomes. Risk assessment can enable healthcare providers to
target resources to patients in greatest need through adaptations in
processes and procedures. Electronic health data facilitates the
application of machine-learning methods for risk analysis. We aim, first
to reveal correlations between HAE occurrence and patients'
characteristics and/or the procedures they undergo during their
hospitalisation, and second, to build models that allow the early
identification of patients at an elevated risk of HAE. Participants143
865 adult patients hospitalised at Grenoble Alpes University Hospital
(France) between 1 January 2016 and 31 December 2018. Findings to dateIn
this set-up phase of the project, we describe the preconditions for big
data analysis using machine-learning methods. We present an overview of
the retrospective de-identified multisource data for a 2-year period
extracted from the hospital's Clinical Data Warehouse, along with social
determinants of health data from the National Institute of Statistics
and Economic Studies, to be used in machine learning (artificial
intelligence) training and validation. No supplementary information or
evaluation on the part of medical staff will be required by the
information system for risk assessment. Future plansWe are using this
data set to develop predictive models for several general HAEs including
secondary intensive care admission, prolonged hospital stay, 7-day and
30-day re-hospitalisation, nosocomial bacterial infection,
hospital-acquired venous thromboembolism, and in-hospital mortality.},

 abstract = {Disaster management is a critical area that requires efficient methods
and techniques to address various challenges. This comprehensive
assessment offers an in-depth overview of disaster management systems,
methods, obstacles, and potential future paths. Specifically, it focuses
on flood control, a significant and recurrent category of natural
disasters. The analysis begins by exploring various types of natural
catastrophes, including earthquakes, wildfires, and floods. It then
delves into the different domains that collectively contribute to
effective flood management. These domains encompass cutting-edge
technologies such as big data analysis and cloud computing, providing
scalable and reliable infrastructure for data storage, processing, and
analysis. The study investigates the potential of the Internet of Things
and sensor networks to gather real-time data from flood-prone areas,
enhancing situational awareness and enabling prompt actions.
Model-driven engineering is examined for its utility in developing and
modeling flood scenarios, aiding in preparation and response planning.
This study includes the Google Earth engine (GEE) and examines previous
studies involving GEE. Moreover, we discuss remote sensing; remote
sensing is undoubtedly a valuable tool for disaster management, and
offers geographical data in various situations. We explore the
application of Geographical Information System (GIS) and Spatial Data
Management for visualizing and analyzing spatial data and facilitating
informed decision-making and resource allocation during floods. In the
final section, the focus shifts to the utilization of machine learning
and data analytics in flood management. These methodologies offer
predictive models and data-driven insights, enhancing early warning
systems, risk assessment, and mitigation strategies. Through this
in-depth analysis, the significance of incorporating these spheres into
flood control procedures is highlighted, with the aim of improving
disaster management techniques and enhancing resilience in flood-prone
regions. The paper addresses existing challenges and provides future
research directions, ultimately striving for a clearer and more coherent
representation of disaster management techniques.},

 abstract = {Construction projects are capital-intensive and risk-prone, which can
lead to serious claims and disputes. Thus, early identification and
intervention of potential risks in contracts play significant roles in
preventing conflicts in advance. However, traditional approaches are
mostly limited to the simple task of predicting fragmentary information
(e.g., a type of risk) from contracts. This study aims to predict
comprehensive information to determine risk-handling actions by
simultaneously performing three classification tasks (i.e., risk
identification, risk allocation, and risk response). Specifically, the
proposed multitask model is designed to integrate shared layers
extracting general features for all three tasks with task-specific
layers extracting relevant features of each individual task. Thus, this
approach allows learning both common and specific features within a
single network. For performance evaluation, experiments were performed
on a data set of 2,586 contractual clauses from 10 construction
projects, in which performance was compared with single-task models not
only on the entire data set but also on the smaller number of data. The
results revealed that the proposed model exhibited higher performance
(mean weighted F1 score of 0.90 and accuracy of 0.78) than single-task
models; furthermore, shared layers may better recognize hidden patterns
for each classification task with the smaller data set (e.g., 0.04
higher mean F1 score and 0.09 higher accuracy for 250 samples). Thus,
the proposed model can successfully implement three tasks
simultaneously. When such information (e.g., risk types, responsible
parties, and corresponding response strategies) is available in an early
contract review, contracting parties shall determine specific
risk-handling actions for proactive risk assessment and management in
construction contracts.},

 abstract = {BackgroundMalnutrition affects many worldwide, necessitating accurate
and timely nutritional risk assessment. This study aims to develop and
validate a machine learning model using facial feature recognition for
predicting nutritional risk. This innovative approach seeks to offer a
non-invasive, efficient method for early identification and
intervention, ultimately improving health outcomes.MethodsWe gathered
medical examination data and facial images from 949 patients across
multiple hospitals to predict nutritional status. In this multicenter
investigation, facial images underwent preprocessing via face alignment
and cropping. Orbital fat pads were isolated using the U-net model, with
the histogram of oriented gradient (HOG) method employed for feature
extraction. Standardized HOG features were subjected to principal
component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction. A support vector
machine (SVM) classification model was utilized for NRS-2002 detection.
Our approach established a non-linear mapping between facial features
and NRS-2002 nutritional risk scores, providing an innovative method for
evaluating patient nutritional status.ResultsIn context of orbital fat
pad area segmentation with U-net model, the averaged dice coefficient is
88.3\%. Our experimental results show that the proposed method to
predict NRS-2002 scores achieves an accuracy of 73.1\%. We also grouped
the samples by gender, age, and the location of the hospital where the
data were collected to evaluate the classification accuracy in different
subsets. The classification accuracy rate for the elderly group was
85\%, while the non-elderly group exhibited a classification accuracy
rate of 71.1\%; Furthermore, the classification accuracy rate for males
and females were 69.2 and 78.6\%, respectively. Hospitals located in
remote areas, such as Tibet and Yunnan, yielded a classification
accuracy rate of 76.5\% for collected patient samples, whereas hospitals
in non-remote areas achieved a classification accuracy rate of
71.1\%.ConclusionThe attained accuracy rate of 73.1\% holds significant
implications for the feasibility of the method. While not impeccable,
this level of accuracy highlights the potential for further
improvements. The development of this algorithm has the potential to
revolutionize nutritional risk assessment by providing healthcare
professionals and individuals with a non-invasive, cost-effective, and
easily accessible tool.},

 abstract = {Arboviral diseases such as dengue, Zika, chikungunya or yellow fever are
a worldwide concern. The abundance of vector species plays a key role in
the emergence of outbreaks of these diseases, so forecasting these
numbers is fundamental in preventive risk assessment. Here we describe
and demonstrate a novel approach that uses state -of-the-art deep
learning algorithms to forecast disease vector abundances. Unlike
classical statistical and machine learning methods, deep learning models
use time series data directly as predictors and identify the features
that are most relevant from a predictive perspective. We demonstrate for
the first time the application of this approach to predict short-term
temporal trends in the number of Aedes aegypti mosquito eggs across
Madeira Island for the period 2013 to 2019. Specifically, we apply the
deep learning models to predict whether, in the following week, the
number of Ae. aegypti eggs will remain unchanged, or whether it will
increase or decrease, considering different percentages of change. We
obtained high predictive performance for all years considered (mean AUC
= 0.92 +/- 0.05 SD). Our approach performed better than classical
machine learning methods. We also found that the preceding numbers of
eggs is a highly informative predictor of future trends. Linking our
approach to disease transmission or importation models will contribute
to operational, early warning systems of arboviral disease risk.},

 abstract = {Background: Carotid plaque can progress into stroke, myocardial
infarction, etc, which are major global causes of death. Evidence shows
a significant increase in carotid plaque incidence among patients with
fatty liver disease. However, unlike the high detection rate of fatty
liver disease, screening for carotid plaque in the asymptomatic
population is not yet prevalent due to cost-effectiveness reasons,
resulting in a large number of patients with undetected carotid plaques,
especially among those with fatty liver disease. Objective: This study
aimed to combine the advantages of machine learning (ML) and logistic
regression to develop a straightforward prediction model among the
population with fatty liver disease to identify individuals at risk of
carotid plaque. Methods: Our study included 5,420,640 participants with
fatty liver from Meinian Health Care Center. We used random forest,
elastic net (EN), and extreme gradient boosting ML algorithms to select
important features from potential predictors. Features acknowledged by
all 3 models were enrolled in logistic regression analysis to develop a
carotid plaque prediction model. Model performance was evaluated based
on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve,
calibration curve, Brier score, and decision curve analysis both in a
randomly split internal validation data set, and an external validation
data set comprising 32,682 participants from MJ Health Check-up Center.
Risk cutoff points for carotid plaque were determined based on the
Youden index, predicted probability distribution, and prevalence rate of
the internal validation data set to classify participants into high-,
intermediate-, and low-risk groups. This risk classification was further
validated in the external validation data set. Results: Among the
participants, 26.23\% (1,421,970/5,420,640) were diagnosed with carotid
plaque in the development data set, and 21.64\% (7074/32,682) were
diagnosed in the external validation data set. A total of 6 features,
including age, systolic blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol (LDL-C), total cholesterol, fasting blood glucose, and
hepatic steatosis index (HSI) were collectively selected by all 3 ML
models out of 27 predictors. After eliminating the issue of collinearity
between features, the logistic regression model established with the 5
independent predictors reached an area under the curve of 0.831 in the
internal validation data set and 0.801 in the external validation data
set, and showed good calibration capability graphically. Its predictive
performance was comprehensively competitive compared with the single use
of either logistic regression or ML algorithms. Optimal predicted
probability cutoff points of 25\% and 65\% were determined for
classifying individuals into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk
categories for carotid plaque. Conclusions: The combination of ML and
logistic regression yielded a practical carotid plaque prediction model,
and was of great public health implications in the early identification
and risk assessment of carotid plaque among individuals with fatty
liver.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND:This study aimed to develop a risk-scoring model for
hypertension among Africans.METHODS:In this study, 4413 stroke-free
controls were used to develop the risk-scoring model for hypertension.
Logistic regression models were applied to 13 risk factors. We randomly
split the dataset into training and testing data at a ratio of 80:20.
Constant and standardized weights were assigned to factors significantly
associated with hypertension in the regression model to develop a
probability risk score on a scale of 0 to 1 using a logistic regression
model. The model accuracy was assessed to estimate the cutoff score for
discriminating hypertensives.RESULTS:Mean age was 59.9 +/- 13.3 years,
56.0\% were hypertensives, and 8 factors, including diabetes, age >= 65
years, higher waist circumference, (BMI) >= 30 kg/m2, lack of formal
education, living in urban residence, family history of cardiovascular
diseases, and dyslipidemia use were associated with hypertension. Cohen
kappa was maximal at >= 0.28, and a total probability risk score of >=
0.60 was adopted for both statistical weighting for risk quantification
of hypertension in both datasets. The probability risk score presented a
good performance-receiver operating characteristic: 64\% (95\% CI,
61.0-68.0), a sensitivity of 55.1\%, specificity of 71.5\%, positive
predicted value of 70.9\%, and negative predicted value of 55.8\%, in
the test dataset. Similarly, decision tree had a predictive accuracy of
67.7\% (95\% CI, 66.1-69.3) for the training set and 64.6\% (95\% CI,
61.0-68.0) for the testing dataset.CONCLUSIONS:The novel risk-scoring
model discriminated hypertensives with good accuracy and will be helpful
in the early identification of community-based Africans vulnerable to
hypertension for its primary prevention.},

 abstract = {Background: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a leading cause of
morbidity and mortality in intensive care units (ICUs). Early
identification of patients at risk of VAP enables early intervention,
which in turn improves patient outcomes. We developed a predictive model
for individualized risk assessment utilizing machine learning to
identify patients at risk of developing VAP. Methods: The Philips eRI
dataset, a multi-institution electronic medical record (EMR), was used
for model development. For adult (>= 18y) patients, we propose a set of
criteria using indications of the start of a new antibiotic treatment
temporally contiguous to a microbiological test to mark suspected
infection events, of which those with a positive culture are labeled as
presumed VAP if 1) the event occurs at least 48 h after intubation, and
2) there are no indications of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) or
other hospital-acquired infections (HAI) in the patient charts. The
resulting VAP and no-VAP (control) cases were then used to build an
ensemble of decision trees to predict the risk of VAP in the next 24 h
using data on patients' demographics, vitals, labs, and ventilator
settings. Results: The resulting model predicts the development of VAP
24 h in advance with an AUC of 76 \% and AUPRC of 75 \%. Additionally,
we group hospitals that are similar in healthcare processes into
distinct clusters and characterize VAP prediction for the identified
hospital clusters. We show inter-hospital (teaching status and
healthcare processes) and cohort-specific (age groups, gender, early vs
late VAP, ICU mortality status) differences in VAP prediction and
associated symptomologies. Conclusions: Our proposed VAP criteria use
clinical actions to mark incidences of presumed VAP infection, which
enables the development of models for early detection of these events.
We curated a patient cohort using these criteria and used it to build a
model for predicting impending VAP events prior to clinical suspicions.
We present a clustering approach for tailoring the VAP prediction model
for different hospital types based on their EMR data characteristics.
The model provides an instantaneous risk score that allows early
interventions and confirmatory diagnostic actions.},

 abstract = {Taiwan has prioritized management and air pollution control of ozone in
the past decade. Atmospheric ozone reacts with gaseous precursors to
produce secondary inorganic aerosols (SIAs), which worsen air quality to
a great extent. The present study applied a bivariate polar plot,
K-means clustering, and a nonlinear autoregressive network with
exogenous input neural network (NARX-NN) to identify the sources of O3
and the formation mechanism of SIAs in an urban area, aiming to
facilitate the development of exposure risk assessment methods and an O3
pollution early warning system for human health protection. Results show
that the present NARX-NN model could be used to capture 72 h ahead of
water-soluble inorganic salts (WIS) and O3 concentrations accurately
with R2 of 0.71 for NO3-, 0.72 for SO42-, 0.80 for NH4+, and 0.79 for O3
concentrations. Based on the statistical and K-means clustering
analysis, the domestic high O3 hours in a year (O3 concentrations>60
ppb) account for up to 76\% and 99\% of the total high O3 hours in
northern and southern Taiwan, respectively. Under volatile organic
compounds (VOCs)-limited regime, an increase in O3 concentrations by
57.4\% was found to enhance heterogeneous oxidation reaction to produce
SIAs by 48.0\% of NO3- and 56.6\% of SO42- under prevailing northeast
monsoon during winter and spring seasons. It is evident that strict
control measures are still necessary for local ozone sources to maintain
air quality. The source tracing framework developed in the present study
is applicable for policymakers to develop early warning systems and
maintain air quality during the decision-making process.},

 abstract = {Tutoring programs are effective in reducing school failures among
at-risk students. However, there is still room for improvement in
maximising the social returns they provide on investments.Many factors
and components can affect student engagement in a program and academic
success. This complexity presents a challenge for Public Administrations
to use their budgets as efficiently as possible. Our research focuses on
providing public administration with advanced decision-making
tools.First, we analyse a database with information on 2066 students of
the Programa para la Mejora de ` Exito Educativo (Programme for the
Improvement of Academic Success) of the Junta de Comunidades de Castilla
y Le ` on in Spain, in 2018-2019, the academic year previous to the
pandemic. This program is designed to help schools with students at risk
of failure in Spanish, literature, mathematics, and English. We
developed a machine learning model (ML) based on Kohonen self-organising
maps (SOMs), which are a type of unsupervised (ANN), to group students
based on their characteristics, the type of tutoring program in which
they were enrolled, and their results in both the completion of the
program and the 4th year of Compulsory Secondary Education (ESO).Second,
we evaluated the results of tutoring programs and identified and
explained how different factors and components affect student engagement
and academic success. Our findings provide Public Administrations with
better decision-making tools to evaluate and measure the results of
tutoring programs in terms of social return on investment, improve the
design of these programs, and choose the students to enrol.},

 abstract = {Diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) are one of the most frequent and debilitating
complications of diabetes. DFU wound healing is a highly complex
process, resulting in significant medical, economic and social
challenges. Therefore, early identification of patients with a high-risk
profile would be important to adequate treatment and more successful
health outcomes. This study explores risk assessment profiles for DFU
healing and healing prognosis, using machine learning predictive
approaches and decision tree algorithms. Patients were evaluated at
baseline (T0; N = 158) and 2 months later (T1; N = 108) on
sociodemographic, clinical, biochemical and psychological variables. The
performance evaluation of the models comprised F1-score, accuracy,
precision and recall. Only profiles with F1-score >0.7 were selected for
analysis. According to the two profiles generated for DFU healing, the
most important predictive factors were illness representations on T1
IPQ-B (IPQ-B <= 9.5 and < 10.5) and the DFU duration (<= 13 weeks). The
two predictive models for DFU healing prognosis suggest that biochemical
factors are the best predictors of a favorable healing prognosis, namely
IL-6, microRNA-146a-5p and PECAM-1 at T0 and angiopoietin-2 at T1.
Illness perception at T0 (IPQ-B <= 39.5) also emerged as a relevant
predictor for healing prognosis. The results emphasize the importance of
DFU duration, illness perception and biochemical markers as predictors
of healing in chronic DFUs. Future research is needed to confirm and
test the obtained predictive models.},

 abstract = {Water damage in mines poses a widespread challenge in the coal mining
industry. Gaining a comprehensive understanding of the multi-factor
spatial catastrophe evolution mechanism and process of floor water
inrush is crucial, which will enable the achievement of dynamic,
quantitative, and precise early warning systems. It holds significant
theoretical guidance for implementing effective water prevention and
control measures in coal mines. This study focuses on the issue of water
inrush in the coal seam floor, specifically in the context of Pengzhuang
coal mine. By utilizing a small sample of non-linear characteristics
derived from drilling geological data, we adopt a multifactor spatial
perspective that considers geological structure and hydrogeological
conditions. In light of this, we propose a quantitative risk prediction
model that integrates the coupled theoretical analysis, statistical
analysis, and machine learning simulation methods. Firstly, the
utilization of a quantification approach employing a triangular fuzzy
number allows for the representation of a comparative matrix based on
empirical values. Simultaneously, the networked risk transmission effect
of underlying control risk factors is taken into consideration. The
application of principal component analysis optimizes the entropy weight
method, effectively reducing the interference caused by multifactor
correlation. By employing game theory, the subjective and objective
weight proportions of the control factors are reasonably allocated,
thereby establishing a vulnerability index model based on a
comprehensive weighting of subjective and objective factors. Secondly,
the WOA-RF-GIS approach is employed to comprehensively explore the
interconnectedness of water diversion channel data. Collaborative
Kriging interpolation is utilized to enhance the dimensionality of the
data and facilitate spatial information processing. Lastly, the
representation of risk is coupled with necessary and sufficient
condition layers, enabling the qualitative visualization of quantitative
results. This approach aims to accurately predict disaster risk with
limited sample data, ultimately achieving the goal of precise risk
assessment. The research findings demonstrate that the reconstructed
optimization model based on multi-factor spatial game theory exhibits
high precision and generalization capability. This model effectively
unveils the non-linear dynamic processes associated with floor water
inrush, which are influenced by multiple factors, characterized by
limited data volume, and governed by complex formation mechanisms. The
identification of high-risk areas for water inrush is achieved with
remarkable accuracy, providing invaluable technical support for the
formulation of targeted water prevention and control measures,
ultimately ensuring the safety of coal mining operations.
Developed a comprehensive weighting model for multi-factor spatial game,
employing PCA for optimizing entropy weighting and triangular fuzzy
numbers for optimizing ANP to dynamically address the subjective and
objective weight characteristics of controlling factors.Utilized WOA
optimization to enhance the random forest algorithm, effectively
uncovering association rules within small-scale datasets and expanding
the interpolation sample base.Applied the vulnerable index method and
geospatial information synthesis software to conduct interpolation
analysis on the risk factors associated with sudden water inrush in the
study area, resulting in a conclusive qualitative representation.},

 abstract = {BackgroundGestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a serious health
concern that affects pregnant women worldwide and can lead to adverse
pregnancy outcomes. Early detection of high-risk individuals and the
implementation of appropriate treatment can enhance these
outcomes.MethodsWe conducted a study on a cohort of 3467 pregnant women
during their pregnancy, with a total of 5649 clinical and biochemical
records collected. We utilized this dataset as our training dataset to
develop a web server called GDMPredictor. The GDMPredictor utilizes
advanced machine learning techniques to predict the risk of GDM in
pregnant women. We also personalize treatment recommendations based on
essential biochemical indicators, such as A1MG, BMG, CysC, CO2, TBA,
FPG, and CREA. Our assessment of GDMPredictor's effectiveness involved
training it on the dataset of 3467 pregnant women and measuring its
ability to predict GDM risk using an AUC and auPRC.ResultsGDMPredictor
demonstrated an impressive level of precision by achieving an AUC score
of 0.967. To tailor our treatment recommendations, we use the GDM risk
level to identify higher risk candidates who require more intensive
care. The GDMPredictor can accept biochemical indicators for predicting
the risk of GDM at any period from 1 to 24 weeks, providing healthcare
professionals with an intuitive interface to identify high-risk patients
and give optimal treatment recommendations.ConclusionsThe GDMPredictor
presents a valuable asset for clinical practice, with the potential to
change the management of GDM in pregnant women. Its high accuracy and
efficiency make it a reliable tool for doctors to improve patient
outcomes. Early identification of high-risk individuals and tailored
treatment can improve maternal and fetal health outcomes

 abstract = {Background: Early identification of patients at high risk of operative
mortality is important for acute type A aortic dissection (TAAD). We
aimed to investigate whether patients with distinct risk stratifications
respond differently to anti-inflammatory pharmacotherapy. Methods: From
13 cardiovascular hospitals, 3110 surgically repaired TAAD patients were
randomly divided into a training set (70\%) and a test set (30\%) to
develop and validate a risk model to predict operative mortality using
extreme gradient boosting. Performance was measured by the area under
the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Subgroup analyses
were performed by risk stratifications (low versus middle-high risk) and
antiinflammatory pharmacotherapy (absence versus presence of ulinastatin
use). Results: A simplified risk model was developed for predicting
operative mortality, consisting of the top ten features of importance:
platelet-leukocyte ratio, D-dimer, activated partial thromboplastin
time, urea nitrogen, glucose, lactate, base excess, hemoglobin, albumin,
and creatine kinase-MB, which displayed a superior discrimination
ability (AUC: 0.943, 95 \% CI 0.928-0.958 and 0.884, 95 \% CI
0.836-0.932) in the derivation and validation cohorts, respectively.
Ulinastatin use was not associated with decreased risk of operative
mortality among each risk stratification, however, ulinastatin use was
associated with a shorter mechanical ventilation duration among patients
with middle-high risk (defined as risk probability >5.0 \%) (beta -1.6
h, 95 \% CI {[}-3.1, -0.1] hours; P = 0.048). Conclusion: This risk
model reflecting inflammatory, coagulation, and metabolic pathways
achieved acceptable predictive performances of operative mortality
following TAAD surgery, which will contribute to individualized
anti-inflammatory pharmacotherapy.},

 abstract = {Cervical cancer is entirely preventable if diagnosed at an early stage;
however, the current rate of cervical cancer screening participation is
not very adequate, and early detection approaches are still open and
demanding. Evaluating the risk levels of potential patients in a
practical and economic way is crucial to direct risky candidates to
screening and establishing potential treatments to conquer the disease.
In this study, a machine learning-integrated fuzzy multi-criteria
decision-making (MCDM) methodology is proposed to assess the cervical
cancer risk levels of patients. In this context, based on behavioral
criteria obtained from the publicly accessible cervical cancer behavior
risk data set from the UCI repository, the risk levels of patients are
evaluated. The proposed methodology is established in three stages: In
the first stage, using a machine learning technique, i.e., feature
selection, the most effective criteria for predicting cervical cancer
risk are selected. In the second stage, the criteria for importance
through intercriteria correlation (CRITIC) method is used to assign
objective importance levels to the criteria. In the third stage, the
cervical cancer risk levels of candidate patients are prioritized using
the technique for order preference by similarity to the ideal solution
(TOPSIS) and, alternatively, the evaluation based on distance from the
average solution (EDAS) techniques. The proposed methodology is
developed in an interval-valued Pythagorean fuzzy atmosphere for
quantifying the uncertainty in the nature of the problem. This study
demonstrates that the feature selection algorithm can be efficiently
utilized to determine the fundamental criteria of an MCDM problem and to
aid in the early identification of cervical cancer.},

 abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has become a revolutionary influence in the
field of ophthalmology, providing unparalleled capabilities in data
analysis and pattern recognition. This narrative review delves into the
crucial role that AI plays, particularly in the context of anterior
segment diseases with a genetic basis. Corneal dystrophies (CDs) exhibit
significant genetic diversity, manifested by irregular substance
deposition in the cornea. AI -driven diagnostic tools exhibit promising
accuracy in the identification and classification of corneal diseases.
Importantly, chat generative pre -trained transformer (ChatGPT)-4.0
shows significant advancement over its predecessor, ChatGPT-3.5. In the
realm of glaucoma, AI significantly contributes to precise diagnostics
through inventive algorithms and machine learning models, surpassing
conventional methods. The incorporation of AI in predicting glaucoma
progression and its role in augmenting diagnostic efficiency is readily
apparent. Additionally, AI -powered models prove beneficial for early
identification and risk assessment in cases of congenital cataracts,
characterized by diverse inheritance patterns. Machine learning models
achieving exceptional discrimination in identifying congenital cataracts
underscore AI's remarkable potential. The review concludes by
emphasizing the promising implications of AI in managing anterior
segment diseases, spanning from early detection to the tailoring of
personalized treatment strategies. These advancements signal a paradigm
shift in ophthalmic care, offering optimism for enhanced patient
outcomes and more streamlined healthcare delivery.},

 abstract = {Storm surge and waves are responsible for a substantial portion of
tropical and extratropical cyclones-related damages. While high-fidelity
numerical models have significantly advanced the simulation accuracy of
storm surge and waves, they are not practical to be employed for
probabilistic analysis, risk assessment or rapid prediction due to their
high computational demands. In this study, a novel hybrid model
combining dimensionality reduction and data-driven techniques is
developed for rapid assessment of waves and storm surge responses over
an extended coastal region. Specifically, the hybrid model
simultaneously identifies a lowdimensional representation of the
high-dimensional spatial system based on a deep autoencoder (DAE) while
mapping the storm parameters to the obtained low-dimensional latent
space using a deep neural network (DNN). To train the hybrid model, a
combined weighted loss function is designed to encourage a balance
between DAE and DNN training and achieve the best accuracy. The
performance of the hybrid model is evaluated through a case study using
the synthetic data from the North Atlantic Comprehensive Coastal Study
(NACCS) covering critical regions within New York and New Jersey. In
addition, the proposed approach is compared with two decoupled models
where the regression model is based on DNN and the reduction techniques
are either principal component analysis (PCA) or DAE which are trained
separately from the DNN model. High accuracy and computational
efficiency are observed for the hybrid model which could be readily
implemented as part of early warning systems or probabilistic risk
assessment of waves and storm surge.},

 abstract = {Background: Early identification of children and families who may
benefit from support is crucial for implementing strategies that can
prevent the onset of child maltreatment. Predictive risk modeling (PRM)
may offer valuable and efficient enhancements to existing risk
assessment techniques. Objective: To evaluate the PRM's effectiveness
against the existing assessment tool in identifying children and
families needing home visiting services. Participants and setting:
Children born in hospitals affiliated with the Bridges Maternal Child
Health Network in Orange County, California, from 2011 to 2016 (N =
132,216). Methods: We developed a PRM tool by integrating a machine
learning algorithm with a linked dataset of birth records and child
protection system (CPS) records. To align with the existing assessment
tool (baseline model), we limited the predicting features to the
information used by the existing tool. The need for home visiting
services was measured by substantiated maltreatment allegation reported
during the first three years of the child's life. Results: Of the
children born in Bridges Network hospitals between 2011 and 2016, 2.7 \%
experienced substantiated maltreatment allegations by the age of three.
Within the top 30 \% of children with high-risk scores, the PRM tool
outperformed the baseline model, accurately identifying 75.3 \%-84.1 \%
of all children who would experience maltreatment substantiation,
surpassing the baseline model's performance of 46.2 \%. Conclusions: Our
study underscores the potential of PRM in enhancing the risk assessment
tool used by a prevention program in a child welfare center in
California. The findings provide valuable insights to practitioners
interested in utilizing data for PRM development, highlighting the
potential of machine learning algorithms to generate accurate
predictions and inform targeted preventive services.},

 abstract = {Water security remains a critical issue given the looming threats of
industrial pollution, necessitating comprehensive assessments of water
quality to address seasonal fluctuations and influential factors while
formulating effective strategies for decision makers. This study
introduces a novel approach for evaluating water quality within a
complex riverine zone in South Korea: Han River that encompasses five
river streams situated at each junction of North and South streams
(including Gyeongan Stream) that ultimately leading towards Paldang
Lake. By utilizing the monthly water characteristic data from the year
2013-2022 across 14 different locations, the significant seasonal trends
and potential influences on water quality are identified. The water
quality here is calculated with the proposed method of sub-index water
quality index (s-WQI). A combinatorial prediction approach of s-WQI for
each location is conducted through a collective of data preprocessing
approaches including Hampel filtering and feature selection in prior to
the machine learning predictions. In return, light gradient boosting
(LGB) is the most accurate predictor by outperforming other prediction
algorithms, especially through LGB-Pearson and LGB-Spearman combinations
for North and South stream intersections, and LGBPearson for Paldang
Lake. To further evaluate the robustness of this evaluation and
extending the results to a foreseeable scenario, a seasonal based
Monte-Carlo Simulation with 10,000 attempts targeting the water
characteristic distributions obtained from each location considered are
carried out to identify the risk bounds within. The results are further
interpreted with SHAP analysis on identifying the contributions of each
water characteristics towards the water quality through local and global
spectrum. This research yields practical implications, offering tailored
strategies for water quality enhancement and early warning systems. The
integration of AI-based prediction and feature selection underscores the
transformative potential of computational techniques in advancing
data-driven water quality assessments, shaping the future of
environmental science research.},

 abstract = {Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms can be applied in
breast cancer risk prediction and prevention by using patient history,
scans, imaging information, and analysis of specific genes for cancer
classification to reduce overdiagnosis and overtreatment. This scoping
review aimed to identify the barriers encountered in applying innovative
AI techniques and models in developing breast cancer risk prediction
scores and promoting screening behaviors among adult females. Findings
may inform and guide future global recommendations for AI application in
breast cancer prevention and care for female populations. Methods: The
PRISMA-SCR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and
Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) was used as a reference
checklist throughout this study. The Arksey and O'Malley methodology was
used as a framework to guide this review. The framework methodology
consisted of five steps: (1) Identify research questions; (2) Search for
relevant studies; (3) Selection of studies relevant to the research
questions; (4) Chart the data; (5) Collate, summarize, and report the
results. Results: In the field of breast cancer risk detection and
prevention, the following AI techniques and models have been applied:
Machine and Deep Learning Model (ML-DL model) (n = 1), Academic
Algorithms (n = 2), Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium (BCSC),
Clinical 5-Year Risk Prediction Model (n = 2), deep-learning computer
vision AI algorithms (n = 2), AI-based thermal imaging solution
(Thermalytix) (n = 1), RealRisks (n = 2), Breast Cancer Risk NAVIgation
(n = 1), MammoRisk (ML-Based Tool) (n = 1), Various MLModels (n = 1),
and various machine/deep learning, decision aids, and commercial
algorithms (n = 7). In the 11 included studies, a total of 39 barriers
to AI applications in breast cancer risk prediction and screening
efforts were identified. The most common barriers in the application of
innovative AI tools for breast cancer prediction and improved screening
rates included lack of external validity and limited generalizability (n
= 6), as AI was used in studies with either a small sample size or
datasets with missing data. Many studies (n = 5) also encountered
selection bias due to exclusion of certain populations based on
characteristics such as race/ethnicity, family history, or past medical
history. Several recommendations for future research should be
considered. AI models need to include a broader spectrum and more
complete predictive variables for risk assessment. Investigating
long-term outcomes with improved follow-up periods is critical to assess
the impacts of AI on clinical decisions beyond just the immediate
outcomes. Utilizing AI to improve communication strategies at both a
local and organizational level can assist in informed decision-making
and compliance, especially in populations with limited literacy levels.
Conclusions: The use of AI in patient education and as an adjunctive
tool for providers is still early in its incorporation, and future
research should explore the implementation of AI-driven resources to
enhance understanding and decision-making regarding breast cancer
screening, especially in vulnerable populations with limited literacy.},

 abstract = {Calcification of the aortic valve (CAVDS) is a major cause of aortic
stenosis (AS) leading to loss of valve function which requires the
substitution by surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) or
transcatheter aortic valve intervention (TAVI). These procedures are
associated with high post-intervention mortality, then the corresponding
risk assessment is relevant from a clinical standpoint. This study
compares the traditional Cox Proportional Hazard (CPH) against Machine
Learning (ML) based methods, such as Deep Learning Survival (DeepSurv)
and Random Survival Forest (RSF), to identify variables able to estimate
the risk of death one year after the intervention, in patients
undergoing either to SAVR or TAVI. We found that with all three
approaches the combination of six variables, named albumin, age, BMI,
glucose, hypertension, and clonal hemopoiesis of indeterminate potential
(CHIP), allows for predicting mortality with a c-index of approximately
80 \% \textbackslash{}documentclass{[}12pt]\{minimal\}

better prediction capability, making them as effective for statistical
analysis in medicine as most state-of-the-art approaches, with the
additional advantage that they may expose non-linear relationships. This
study aims to improve the early identification of patients at higher
risk of death, who could then benefit from a more appropriate
therapeutic intervention.},

clinical factors associated with this progression. A retrospective
analysis of TBI patients between January 2010 and December 2021 was
performed, focusing on initial CT evaluations and demographic, comorbid,
and medical history data. ICH was categorized into intraparenchymal
hemorrhage (IPH), petechial hemorrhage (PH), and subarachnoid hemorrhage
(SAH). Within our study cohort, we identified a 22.2\% progression rate
of ICH among 650 TBI patients. The Random Forest algorithm identified
variables such as petechial hemorrhage (PH) and countercoup injury as
significant predictors of ICH progression. The XGBoost algorithm,
incorporating key variables identified through SHAP values, demonstrated
robust performance, achieving an AUC of 0.9. Additionally, an individual
risk assessment diagram, utilizing significant SHAP values, visually
represented the impact of each variable on the risk of ICH progression,
providing personalized risk profiles. This approach, highlighted by an
AUC of 0.913, underscores the model's precision in predicting ICH
progression, marking a significant step towards enhancing TBI patient
management through early identification of ICH progression risks.},

 abstract = {This research paper explores innovative contributions to the field of
disaster management in smart urban environments, with a particular focus
on integrating advanced computer -aided techniques, specifically GRUCNN.
Three key contributions are highlighted: (1) the development of dynamic
risk assessment algorithms utilizing GRU-CNN for real-time analysis and
predictive modeling, enabling proactive disaster mitigation; (2) the
establishment of an integrated sensor network infrastructure for early
warning systems, leveraging various sensors and GRU-CNN-based data
analytics to detect and respond to potential disasters at their nascent
stages; and (3) the implementation of human -centric resilience
planning, utilizing GRU-CNN-based computeraided tools to simulate
disaster scenarios and engage communities in preparedness efforts. The
dynamic risk assessment algorithms presented in this paper, powered by
GRU-CNN, enable continuous monitoring and analysis of diverse data
sources, fostering a proactive approach to disaster preparedness. The
integrated sensor network architecture enhances early warning
capabilities, allowing for timely responses to emerging threats through
the application of GRU-CNN methodologies. Furthermore, the human
-centric resilience planning approach introduces virtual simulations
using GRU-CNN to model disaster scenarios, facilitating the testing and
refinement of strategies in a risk -free environment. This approach not
only ensures the adaptability of plans but also engages and educates
communities, fostering a culture of preparedness, with GRU-CNN playing a
pivotal role in the process. Through these contributions, this research
paper seeks to advance the discourse on disaster management in smart
urban environments, emphasizing the integration and effectiveness of
GRUCNN in enhancing resilience and response strategies. By leveraging
cutting -edge GRU-CNN technologies and prioritizing community
involvement, the proposed techniques aim to provide a more robust and
adaptive response to the challenges posed by natural and man-made
disasters in urban settings.},

 abstract = {BackgroundSurgery in geriatric patients often poses risk of major
postoperative complications. Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common
complication following noncardiac surgery and is associated with
increased mortality. Early identification of geriatric patients at high
risk of AKI could facilitate preventive measures and improve patient
prognosis. This study used machine learning methods to identify
important features and predict AKI following noncardiac surgery in
geriatric patients.MethodsThe data for this study were obtained from a
prospective cohort. Patients aged >= 65 years who received noncardiac
surgery from June 2019 to December 2021 were enrolled. Data were split
into training set (from June 2019 to March 2021) and internal validation
set (from April 2021 to December 2021) by time. The least absolute
shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regularization algorithm and
the random forest recursive feature elimination algorithm (RF-RFE) were
used to screen important predictors. Models were trained through extreme
gradient boosting (XGBoost), random forest, and LASSO. The SHapley
Additive exPlanations (SHAP) package was used to interpret the machine
learning model.ResultsThe training set included 6753 geriatric patients.
Of these, 250 (3.70\%) patients developed AKI. The XGBoost model with
RF-RFE selected features outperformed other models with an area under
the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) of 0.505 (95\% confidence interval
{[}CI]: 0.369-0.626) and an area under the receiver operating
characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.806 (95\%CI: 0.733-0.875). The model
incorporated ten predictors, including operation site and hypertension.
The internal validation set included 3808 geriatric patients, and 96
(2.52\%) patients developed AKI. The model maintained good predictive
performance with an AUPRC of 0.431 (95\%CI: 0.331-0.524) and an AUROC of
0.845 (95\%CI: 0.796-0.888) in the internal validation.ConclusionsThis
study developed a simple machine learning model and a web calculator for
predicting AKI following noncardiac surgery in geriatric patients. This
model may be a valuable tool for guiding preventive measures and
improving patient prognosis.Trial registrationThe protocol of this study
was approved by the Committee of Ethics from West China Hospital of

 abstract = {Introduction and objectives This study investigates key factors
influencing dental caries risk in children aged 7 and under using
machine learning techniques. By addressing dental caries' prevalence, it
aims to enhance early identification and preventative strategies for
high-risk individuals.Methods Data from clinical examinations of 356
children were analyzed using Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and
Random Forests models. These models assessed the influence of dietary
habits, fluoride exposure, and socio-economic status on caries risk,
emphasizing accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC
metrics.Results Poor oral hygiene, high sugary diet, and low fluoride
exposure were identified as significant caries risk factors. The Random
Forest model demonstrated superior performance, illustrating the
potential of machine learning in complex health data analysis. Our SHAP
analysis identified poor oral hygiene, high sugary diet, and low
fluoride exposure as significant caries risk factors.Conclusion Machine
learning effectively identifies and quantifies dental caries risk
factors in children. This approach supports targeted interventions and
preventive measures, improving pediatric dental health outcomes.Clinical
significance By leveraging machine learning to pinpoint crucial caries
risk factors, this research lays the groundwork for data-driven
preventive strategies, potentially reducing caries prevalence and
promoting better dental health in children.},

@article{WOS:001261844200001,
 abstract = {Urban flooding is escalating worldwide due to the increasing impervious
surfaces from urban developments and frequency of extreme rainfall
events by climate change. Traditional flood extent prediction and
mapping methods based on physical-based hydrological principles often
face limitations due to model complexity and computational burden. In
response to these challenges, there has been a notable shift toward
satellite image processing and Artificial Intelligence (AI) based
approaches, such as Deep Learning (DL) models, including architectures
like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The objective of this research
is to predict near real-time (NRT) flood extents within urban areas.
This research integrated CNN (U-Net) with Sentinel-1 satellite imagery,
Digital Elevation Model (DEM), hydrologic soil group (HSG),
imperviousness, and rainfall data to create a flood extent prediction
model. To detect flooded areas, a binary raster map was created using
calibrated backscatter values derived from the VV (vertical transmit and
vertical receive) polarization mode of Sentinel-1 imagery, which was
highlighted as having a significant impact on backscatter behavior and
prediction results. Application of the model was demonstrated in urban
areas of Miami-Dade County, Florida. The results demonstrated the
capability of the model to provide rapid and accurate flood extent
predictions at a spatial resolution of 10 m, with an overall accuracy of
97.05 \%, F-1 Score of 92.49 \%, and AUC of 93 \% in the study area. The
U-Net model's flood predictions were compared with historical floodplain
data and then using GIS overlay analysis, resulting in a Ground Truth
Index of 84.05 \% that shows the accuracy of the model in identifying
flooded areas. The research incorporated crucial flood-influencing data
(including rainfall) to the flood extent prediction models and expanded
the focus models beyond major rainfall events only to encompass a wider
range of flood events. The presented NRT flood extent mapping model has
a broad range of applicability, including, but not limited to, the
continuous monitoring of flood events and their potential impacts on
civil infrastructure assets (e.g., construction, operation, and
maintenance of roads and bridges), early warning systems for timely
evacuation and preparedness measures, and insurance risk assessment.},

 abstract = {Background The work aims to provide a method for assessing newborn
infants' risk to determine whether they need to be admitted to the NICU
before birth. Term neonates who were admitted to the NICU are known to
have health problems, a greater mortality risk, and higher healthcare
costs. Researchers want to develop an algorithm that estimates the risk
of NICU admission for this particular subset of newborns using an
integrated statistical approach. This risk assessment might lower the
morbidity, mortality, and healthcare expenses related to NICU
hospitalizations by assisting in the early identification of possible
instances. Method The data was collected from a multispecialty hospital
using hospital-based records from the obstetrics and gynecology
department. All the clinical and demographic parameters are described as
per requirement. A multivariate statistical analysis was done to
identify potential risk factors for NICU admission. Four classification
models were used to predict NICU admission. All the models were
evaluated based on their performance matrices. Results In multivariate
analysis, we found Preterm deliveries (beta = 1.003 Aor = 2.727 95\% CI

 abstract = {Background: Identifying individuals with depressive symptomatology (DS)
promptly and effectively is of paramount importance for providing timely
treatment. Machine learning models have shown promise in this area;
however, studies often fall short in demonstrating the practical
benefits of using these models and fail to provide tangible real-world
applications. Objective: This study aims to establish a novel
methodology for identifying individuals likely to exhibit DS, identify
the most influential features in a more explainable way via
probabilistic measures, and propose tools that can be used in real-world
applications. Methods: The study used 3 data sets: PROACTIVE, the
Brazilian National Health Survey (Pesquisa Nacional de Sa \& uacute;de
{[}PNS]) 2013, and PNS 2019, comprising sociodemographic and
health-related features. A Bayesian network was used for feature
selection. Selected features were then used to train machine learning
models to predict DS, operationalized as a score of >= 10 on the 9-item
Patient Health Questionnaire. The study also analyzed the impact of
varying sensitivity rates on the reduction of screening interviews
compared to a random approach. Results: The methodology allows the users
to make an informed trade-off among sensitivity, specificity, and a
reduction in the number of interviews. At the thresholds of 0.444,
0.412, and 0.472, determined by maximizing the Youden index, the models
achieved sensitivities of 0.717, 0.741, and 0.718, and specificities of
0.644, 0.737, and 0.766 for PROACTIVE, PNS 2013, and PNS 2019,
respectively. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
was 0.736, 0.801, and 0.809 for these 3 data sets, respectively. For the
PROACTIVE data set, the most influential features identified were
postural balance, shortness of breath, and how old people feel they are.
In the PNS 2013 data set, the features were the ability to do usual
activities, chest pain, sleep problems, and chronic back problems. The
PNS 2019 data set shared 3 of the most influential features with the PNS
2013 data set. However, the difference was the replacement of chronic
back problems with verbal abuse. It is important to note that the
features contained in the PNS data sets differ from those found in the
PROACTIVE data set. An empirical analysis demonstrated that using the
proposed model led to a potential reduction in screening interviews of
up to 52\% while maintaining a sensitivity of 0.80. Conclusions: This
study developed a novel methodology for identifying individuals with DS,
demonstrating the utility of using Bayesian networks to identify the
most significant features. Moreover, this approach has the potential to
substantially reduce the number of screening interviews while
maintaining high sensitivity, thereby facilitating improved early
identification and intervention strategies for individuals experiencing
DS.},

 abstract = {Sports injuries pose significant challenges in athlete welfare and team
dynamics, particularly in high-intensity sports like soccer. This study
used machine learning algorithms to assess non-contact injury risk in
professional male soccer players from physiological and mechanical load
variables. Twenty-five professional male soccer players with a
first-time, non-contact muscle injury were included in this study.
Recordings of external load (speed, distance, and
acceleration/deceleration data) and internal load (heart rate) were
obtained during all training sessions and official matches over a 4-year
period. Machine learning model training and evaluation features were
calculated for each of nine different metrics for a 28-day period prior
to the injury and an equal-length baseline epoch. The acute surge in the
values of each workload metric was quantified by the deviation of
maximum values from the average, while the variations of cumulative
workload over the last four weeks preceding injury were also calculated.
Seven features were selected by the model as prominent estimators of
injury incidence. Three of the features concerned acute load deviations
(number of sprints, training load score-incorporating heart rate and
muscle load- and time of heart rate at the 90- 100\% of maximum). The
four cumulative load features were (total distance, high speed and
sprint running distance and training load score). The accuracy of the
muscle injury risk assessment model was 0.78, with a sensitivity of 0.73
and specificity of 0.85. Our model achieved high performance in injury
risk detection using a limited number of training load variables. The
inclusion, for the first time, of heart rate related variables in an
injury risk assessment model highlights the importance of physiological
overload as a contributor to muscle injuries in soccer. By identifying
the important parameters, coaches may prevent muscle injuries by
controlling surges of training load during training and competition.},

 abstract = {This study utilizes artificial neural networks (ANN) to estimate
prediction intervals (PI) for seismic performance assessment of
buildings subjected to long-term ground motion. To address the
uncertainty quantification in structural health monitoring (SHM), the
quality-driven lower upper bound estimation (QD-LUBE) has been opted for
global probabilistic assessment of damage at local and global levels,
unlike traditional methods. A distribution-free machine learning model
has been adopted for enhanced reliability in quantifying uncertainty and
ensuring robustness in post-earthquake probabilistic assessments and
early warning systems. The distribution-free machine learning model is
capable of quantifying uncertainty with high accuracy as compared to
previous methods such as the bootstrap method, etc. This research
demonstrates the efficacy of the QD-LUBE method in complex seismic risk
assessment scenarios, thereby contributing significant enhancement in
building resilience and disaster management strategies. This study also
validates the findings through fragility curve analysis, offering
comprehensive insights into structural damage assessment and mitigation
strategies.},

 abstract = {Background: Hospital-acquired complications (HACs) have an adverse
impact on patient recovery by impeding their path to full recovery and
increasing healthcare costs.Objective: The aim of this study was to
create a HAC risk prediction machine learning (ML) framework using
hospital administrative data collections within North Metropolitan
Health Service (NMHS), Western Australia.Method: A retrospective cohort
study was performed among 64,315 patients between July 2020 to June 2022
to develop an automated ML framework by inputting HAC and the healthcare
site to obtain site-specific predictive algorithms for patients admitted
to the hospital in NMHS. Univariate analysis was used for initial
feature screening for 270 variables. Of these, 77 variables had
significant relationship with any HAC. After excluding
non-contemporaneous data, 37 variables were included in developing the
ML framework based on logistic regression (LR), decision tree (DT) and
random forest (RF) models to predict occurrence of four specific HACs:
delirium, aspiration pneumonia, pneumonia and urinary tract
infection.Results: All models exhibited similar performance with area
under the curve scores around 0.90 for both training and testing
datasets. For sensitivity, DT and RF exceeded LR performance while on
average, false positives were lowest for LR-based models. Patient's
length of stay, Charlson Index, operation length and intensive care unit
stay were common predictors.Conclusion: Integrating ML-based risk
detection systems into clinical workflows can potentially enhance
patient safety and optimise resource allocation. LR-based models
exhibited best performance.Implications: We have successfully developed
a ``real-time{''} risk prediction model, where patient risk scores are
calculated and reviewed daily.},

 abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) holds significant promise for advancing
natural disaster management through the use of predictive models that
analyze extensive datasets, identify patterns, and forecast potential
disasters. These models facilitate proactive measures such as early
warning systems (EWSs), evacuation planning, and resource allocation,
addressing the substantial challenges associated with natural disasters.
This study offers a comprehensive exploration of trustworthy AI
applications in natural disasters, encompassing disaster management,
risk assessment, and disaster prediction. This research is underpinned
by an extensive review of reputable sources, including Science Direct
(SD), Scopus, IEEE Xplore (IEEE), and Web of Science (WoS). Three
queries were formulated to retrieve 981 papers from the earliest
documented scientific production until February 2024. After meticulous
screening, deduplication, and application of the inclusion and exclusion
criteria, 108 studies were included in the quantitative synthesis. This
study provides a specific taxonomy of AI applications in natural
disasters and explores the motivations, challenges, recommendations, and
limitations of recent advancements. It also offers an overview of recent
techniques and developments in disaster management using explainable
artificial intelligence (XAI), data fusion, data mining, machine
learning (ML), deep learning (DL), fuzzy logic, and multicriteria
decision-making (MCDM). This systematic contribution addresses seven
open issues and provides critical solutions through essential insights,
laying the groundwork for various future works in trustworthiness
AI-based natural disaster management. Despite the potential benefits,
challenges persist in the application of AI to natural disaster
management. In these contexts, this study identifies several unused and
used areas in natural disaster-based AI theory, collects the disaster
datasets, ML, and DL techniques, and offers a valuable XAI approach to
unravel the complex relationships and dynamics involved and the
utilization of data fusion techniques in decision-making processes
related to natural disasters. Finally, the study extensively analyzed
ethical considerations, bias, and consequences in natural disaster-based
AI.},

 abstract = {Introduction Identifying students at risk of failure before they
experience difficulties may considerably improve their outcomes.
However, identification techniques can be costly, time-intensive, and of
unknown efficacy. Medical educators need accessible and cost-effective
ways of identifying at-risk students. The aim of this study was to
investigate the relationship between student engagement in an online
classroom and academic performance given the transition of many courses
from in-person to online learning. Methods A retrospective study was
conducted on a group of 235 students from the University of Edinburgh
Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery (MBChB) in Year One for eight weeks
from the start of term, September 2020. Purposive sampling was used.
Data were collected on total test submissions, total discussion board
submissions, engagement scores, and overall exam scores. Learning
analytics on discussion board engagement were collected for new medical
students before they had sat any summative assessment. Tests completed,
discussion board posts made, and their total engagement score were
correlated with their first summative assessment scores at the end of
semester one. Results We found a statistically significant correlation
between total test submissions, total discussion board submissions,
engagement scores, and overall exam scores, with small-medium effects (r
= 0.281, p<0.001) (r = 0.241, p<0.001), and (r = 0.202, p<0.001).
Students with more test submissions, total discussion board submissions,
and total engagement had a higher overall exam score. There was a
statistically significant moderate correlation between total submissions
and overall exam scores (r = 0.324, p<0.001). Conclusions Students who
had a higher number of submissions were more likely to perform better on
assessments. Early engagement correlates with performance. Learning
analytics can help identify student underperformance before they
undertake any assessment, and this can be done very inexpensively and
with minimal staff resources if properly planned.},

 abstract = {BackgroundPrecisely estimating the probability of mental health
challenges among college students is pivotal for facilitating timely
intervention and preventative measures. However, to date, no specific
artificial intelligence (AI) models have been reported to effectively
forecast severe mental distress. This study aimed to develop and
validate an advanced AI tool for predicting the likelihood of severe
mental distress in college students.MethodsA total of 2088 college
students from five universities were enrolled in this study.
Participants were randomly divided into a training group (80\%) and a
validation group (20\%). Various machine learning models, including
logistic regression (LR), extreme gradient boosting machine (eXGBM),
decision tree (DT), k-nearest neighbor (KNN), random forest (RF), and
support vector machine (SVM), were employed and trained in this study.
Model performance was evaluated using 11 metrics, and the highest
scoring model was selected. In addition, external validation was
conducted on 751 participants from three universities. The AI tool was
then deployed as a web-based AI application.ResultsAmong the models
developed, the eXGBM model achieved the highest area under the curve
(AUC) value of 0.932 (95\% CI: 0.911-0.949), closely followed by RF with
an AUC of 0.927 (95\% CI: 0.905-0.943). The eXGBM model demonstrated
superior performance in accuracy (0.850), precision (0.824), recall
(0.890), specificity (0.810), F1 score (0.856), Brier score (0.103), log
loss (0.326), and discrimination slope (0.598). The eXGBM model also
received the highest score of 60 based on the evaluation scoring system,
while RF achieved a score of 49. The scores of LR, DT, and SVM were only
19, 32, and 36, respectively. External validation yielded an impressive
AUC value of 0.918.ConclusionsThe AI tool demonstrates promising
predictive performance for identifying college students at risk of
severe mental distress. It has the potential to guide intervention
strategies and support early identification and preventive measures.},

 abstract = {Accurately assessing suicide risk is a critical concern in mental health
care. Traditional methods, which often rely on self-reporting and
clinical interviews, are limited by their subjective nature and may
overlook non-verbal cues. This study introduces an innovative approach
to suicide risk assessment using facial image analysis. The Suicidal
Visual Indicators Prediction (SVIP) Framework leverages EfficientNetb0
and ResNet architectures, enhanced through Bayesian optimization
techniques, to detect nuanced facial expressions indicating mental
state. The models' interpretability is improved using GRADCAM, Occlusion
Sensitivity, and LIME, which highlight significant facial regions for
predictions. Using datasets DB1 and DB2, which consist of full and
cropped facial images from social media profiles of individuals with
known suicide outcomes, the method achieved 67.93\% accuracy with
EfficientNetb0 on DB1 and up to 76.6\% accuracy with a
Bayesian-optimized Support Vector Machine model using ResNet18 features
on DB2. This approach provides a less intrusive, accessible alternative
to video-based methods and demonstrates the substantial potential for
early detection and intervention in mental health care.},

 abstract = {This article offers a thorough review of current early warning systems
(EWS) and advocates for establishing a unified research network for EWS
in infectious diseases between China and Australia. We propose that
future research should focus on improving infectious disease
surveillance by integrating data from both countries to enhance
predictive models and intervention strategies. The article highlights
the need for standardized data formats and terminologies, improved
surveillance capabilities, and the development of robust spatiotemporal
predictive models. It concludes by examining the potential benefits and
challenges of this collaborative approach and its implications for
global infectious disease surveillance. This is particularly relevant to
the ongoing project, early warning systems for Infectious Diseases
between China and Australia (NetEWAC), which aims to use seasonal
influenza as a case study to analyze influenza trends, peak activities,
and potential interhemispheric transmission patterns. The project seeks
to integrate data from both hemispheres to improve outbreak predictions
and develop a spatiotemporal predictive modeling system for seasonal
influenza transmission based on socio-environmental factors.},

 abstract = {Alzheimer's disease (AD) represents a growing global health concern,
emphasizing the urgent need for early detection and intervention
strategies. This review article aims to provide a comprehensive analysis
of the pivotal role that machine learning (ML) and advanced imaging
techniques play in the early identification of AD. The study delves into
an extensive array of methodologies, encompassing visual biomarkers,
datasets, imaging modalities, and evaluation metrics essential for AD
detection. The investigation encompasses diverse ML techniques, starting
with pre-processing steps and extending to various data types, feature
extractor models, and both conventional and deep learning algorithms.
Highlighting the significance of Convolutional Neural Networks,
Autoencoders, and Transfer Learning, the review assesses their efficacy
in AD diagnosis. The findings underscore the intricate challenges and
opportunities within the realm of AD detection. Notably, the integration
of ML and imaging methods yields promising results in distinguishing AD
patterns from healthy brain states. Robust models and algorithms
demonstrated notable accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity when
confronted with diverse datasets, thus paving the way for early AD

 abstract = {Introduction Falls have been acknowledged as a major public health issue
around the world. Early detection of fall risk is pivotal for preventive
measures. Traditional clinical assessments, although reliable, are
resource-intensive and may not always be feasible.Methods This study
explores the efficacy of artificial intelligence (AI) in predicting fall
risk, leveraging gait analysis through computer vision and machine
learning techniques. Data was collected using the Timed Up and Go (TUG)
test and JHFRAT assessment from MMU collaborators and augmented with a
public dataset from Mendeley involving older adults. The study
introduces a robust approach for extracting and analyzing gait features,
such as stride time, step time, cadence, and stance time, to distinguish
between fallers and non-fallers.Results Two experimental setups were
investigated: one considering separate gait features for each foot and
another analyzing averaged features for both feet. Ultimately, the
proposed solutions produce promising outcomes, greatly enhancing the
model's ability to achieve high levels of accuracy. In particular, the
LightGBM demonstrates a superior accuracy of 96\% in the prediction
task.Discussion The findings demonstrate that simple machine learning
models can successfully identify individuals at higher fall risk based
on gait characteristics, with promising results that could potentially
streamline fall risk assessment processes. However, several limitations
were discovered throughout the experiment, including an insufficient
dataset and data variation, limiting the model's generalizability. These
issues are raised for future work consideration. Overall, this research
contributes to the growing body of knowledge on fall risk prediction and
underscores the potential of AI in enhancing public health strategies
through the early identification of at-risk individuals.},

 abstract = {Subclinical cardiovascular disease (Sub-CVD) is an early stage of
cardiovascular disease and is often asymptomatic. Risk factors,
including hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and lifestyle, significantly
affect Sub-CVD. Progress in imaging technology has facilitated the
timely identification of disease phenotypes and risk categorization. The
critical function of dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in
predicting Sub-CVD was the subject of this research. Initially used to
evaluate bone mineral density, DXA has now evolved into an indispensable
tool for assessing body composition, which is a pivotal determinant in
estimating cardiovascular risk. DXA offers precise measurements of body
fat, lean muscle mass, bone density, and abdominal aortic calcification,
rendering it an essential tool for Sub-CVD evaluation. This study
examined the efficacy of DXA in integrating various risk factors into a
comprehensive assessment and how the application of machine learning
could enhance the early discovery and control of cardiovascular risks.
DXA exhibits distinct advantages and constraints compared to alternative
imaging modalities such as ultrasound, computed tomography, magnetic
resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography. This review
advocates DXA incorporation into cardiovascular health assessments,
emphasizing its crucial role in the early identification and management
of Sub-CVD.},

 abstract = {BACKGROUND: Early identification of patients at increased risk for
postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) associated with severe maternal morbidity
(SMM) is critical for preparation and preventative intervention.
However, prediction is challenging in patients without obvious risk
factors for postpartum hemorrhage with severe maternal morbidity.
Current tools for hemorrhage risk assessment use lists of risk factors
rather than predictive models. OBJECTIVE: To develop, validate
(internally and externally), and compare a machine learning model for
predicting PPH associated with SMM against a standard hemorrhage risk
assessment tool in a lower risk laboring obstetric population. STUDY
DESIGN: This retrospective cross-sectional study included clinical data
from singleton, term births (>=37 weeks' gestation) at 19 US hospitals
(2016-2021) using data from 58,023 births at 11 hospitals to train a
generalized additive model (GAM) and 27,743 births at 8 held- out
hospitals to externally validate the model. The outcome of interest was
PPH with severe maternal morbidity (blood transfusion, hysterectomy,
vascular embolization, intrauterine balloon tamponade, uterine artery
ligation suture, uterine compression suture, or admission to intensive
care). Cesarean birth without a trial of vaginal birth and patients with
a history of cesarean were excluded. We compared the model performance
to that of the California Maternal Quality Care Collaborative (CMQCC)
Obstetric Hemorrhage Risk Factor Assessment Screen. RESULTS: The GAM
predicted PPH with an area under the receiver- operating characteristic
curve (AUROC) of 0.67 (95\% CI 0.64-0.68) on external validation,
significantly outperforming the CMQCC risk screen AUROC of 0.52 (95\% CI
0.50-0.53). Additionally, the GAM had better sensitivity of 36.9\% (95\%
CI 33.01-41.02) than the CMQCC screen sensitivity of 20.30\% (95\% CI
17.40-22.52) at the CMQCC screen positive rate of 16.8\%. The GAM
identified in-vitro fertilization as a risk factor (adjusted OR 1.5;
95\% CI 1.2-1.8) and nulliparous births as the highest PPH risk factor
(adjusted OR 1.5; 95\% CI 1.4-1.6). CONCLUSION: Our model identified
almost twice as many cases of PPH as the CMQCC rules-based approach for
the same screen positive rate and identified in-vitro fertilization and
first-time births as risk factors for PPH. Adopting predictive models
over traditional screens can enhance PPH prediction.},

 abstract = {This study evaluates several machine learning models used in predicting student performance. The data utilized in this study was collected from 253 undergraduate students participating in five classes within one of three courses offered by VnCodelab, an interactive learning management system, to provide insights into student performance. Leveraging the data-rich environment of the interactive learning management system proposed earlier, this study focuses on training a predictive model that forecasts student grades based on the comprehensive data collected during the teaching process. The proposed model capitalizes on the data obtained from students' engagement patterns, time spent on exercises, and progress tracking across learning activities. This study compared five different base classifiers— Random Forest (RF), Logistic Regression (LR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naïve Bayes (NB), and k-nearest Neighbor (k-NN), and an ensemble learning method Stacking Classifier —utilizing a dataset comprising 13 features. The research assesses the model's accuracy, reliability, and implications, contributing to the evolution of educational evaluation by introducing predictive assessment as a transformative tool. The results indicate that the Stacking Classifier accurately predicts students' grade ranges, surpassing individual base classification models by effectively combining their predictive capabilities. Integrating data-driven forecasting into the educational ecosystem can transform teaching methodologies and foster an informed, engaged, and empowered learning environment. This approach cultivates a proactive learning community by empowering students with real-time academic progress forecasts. Educators benefit from data-informed insights that facilitate more effective and objective performance evaluation.},

@article{ZACHARIS201544,
 abstract = {This study aimed to develop a practical model for predicting students at risk of performing poorly in blended learning courses. Previous research suggests that analyzing usage data stored in the log files of modern Learning Management Systems (LMSs) would allow teachers to develop timely, evidence-based interventions to support at risk or struggling students. The analysis of students' tracking data from a Moodle LMS-supported blended learning course was the focus of this research in an effort to identify significant correlations between different online activities and course grade. Out of 29 LMS usage variables, 14 were found to be significant and were input in a stepwise multivariate regression which revealed that only four variables – Reading and posting messages, Content creation contribution, Quiz efforts and Number of files viewed – predicted 52% of the variance in the final student grade.},
